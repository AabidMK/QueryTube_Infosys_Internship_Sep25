Everyone's crazy about football,
but boxing,
that's a neverending game of tackles.
One wrong move,
game over.
Tennis, a marathon with the racket. When
it goes wrong, you become your own worst
enemy.
Now imagine every move timed in a
millisecond and behind you a shadow
ready to steal victory.
I came for football. I stay for more.
[Applause]"

In every era, a rare few rise above the
rest.
Now, a new generation emerges. Each
bearing a key and everything to prove.
Success demands perseverance,
challenging those who dare to try. They
step forward to answer the legend's
call. Rise above at the esports World
Cup."
x_IRSJ9EOxA,"of course since since day one I have a a
compromise that to make change not only
in al-Nasad but in in a country too. So
this is my goal. Of course, my goal is
always to win something important for
Al-Mnasar. And of course, I still
believe on that. This is why I renewed
the two years more because I believe
that I will be champion in Saudi Arabia.
As you mentioned, I had some offers to
play World Cup, but I think it didn't
make sense because um I prefer to have a
a good rest, a good preparation because
this season will be very long because
this is the season of the World Cup in
the end of the season. So, I want to be
ready not only for Alnasar but also for
the national team. So this is why I
decide
to play the last game for the Nationals
League and to don't listen nothing and
of course to be in this club which is I
I love it. Amazing.
Of course, we're still improving, but I
believe that in this moment, we are in
top five already, but I still believe
that we continue to improve and we have
time and we show the last two years
enough that the league is it's going up
all the time. So, I'm happy because I
know the league is very competitive.
Only the people who never play in Saudi,
they don't understand nothing about
football and say this league is not in a
top five. I believe 100% in my words and
the people who play in this league, they
know what I'm talking about. So this is
why I want to stay because I believe in
the project uh not the next two years
but until
2034 which is is the goal and uh will be
the World Cup in Saudi Arabia which is I
believe two that will be the most
beautiful one ever. So I'm happy two
years more. I want to fight with the the
best teams in Saudi to win the league, I
believe. And let's see in the end of the
day who is better.
This feeling amazing. This is why uh I
stay I will stay two years more as a
football player but also for a life
because my contribution for this country
is not only for football. It's it's for
everything. So I want to be part of the
the grow of the country forever. And of
course the fans is the role of the fans
is uh very important on my decision
because I know the people love me. I
love Saudi people and I want to continue
to give in joy to these people because
they always support me. They always on
my back and as I say before what I want
is to win something important for this
club. Not only the Kings club, Kings
club that we win in the beginning of two
years ago, but I believe that we have
potential to win more important things.
Stay two more years. Of course, we are
not happy for what's happened the last
season. It's normal. If we are the
competitive and if we are a winner, we
know that what we did last season is not
enough. But is already passed. We have
to focus now in the present. The present
is good. We change. We're going to
change so many things. The projects I
believe in the project. I believe in
al-Nasad. I believe in the fans. The
past is passed. Let's be positive. Let's
thinking positive. Let's think that this
season will be our best season ever. And
um the past is passed. We not recover
what's happened before. Now we have to
believe in the present. The present I
believe that this season we're going to
do an amazing season and we're gonna win
something very very very important. And
of course the supporters should be in
our sides because with them we're going
to be more stronger. So let's be
positive and believe.
Well my my family always support me. It
doesn't matter which decision I take. uh
not only here in Saudi Arabia but all
the decisions that I took it before with
Juventus with Manchester United, Real
Madrid. So they are the most important
thing. It's if your family supports you
and my family always support me in my
decisions. So for me it's it's the most
important. If they are happy I'm happy
and they are happy in Saudi. We do it a
good life. They the Saudi people treat
us very very very good. This is why we
we want to live there and continue to do
what our life there. And of course in in
a sport way I believe as I told you
before I believe that we're going to win
something important this season.
I think we don't need to convince
nobody. The life is like that.
Come and see with your own eyes. I think
it's it's what you have to say to the
people.
For example, to give you example, look,
I'm now in the Red Sea. I don't coming
because because nothing I coming because
I like it and my family like it. I feel
peace here. Not only the most all the
days, best parts in Saudi, but also
the Jeda. I love Saudi. I recommend to
people to coming there.
They changed Saudi I know and this story
the history of about Saudi they change a
lot
so it's good I recommend to cominging
and to visit this amazing country you
have amazing culture that which is I I
like it and um come and look with your
own eyes I think it's the best advice
that you can give to the people
100% as you say before I I help that to
coming here two years ago
and people look now Saudi with a
different eyes which is I feel happy
because I help on that but of course we
have to mention uh the our crown prince
that he do with amazing work amazing job
and is the the the the most important
person in the process of changes of the
country. So we have to appreciate him
and his his people around him that you
do amazing work. I'm so happy. You
should be proud of your country because
you have you have amazing country and um
the future will be bright because the
things going so fast you not only speak
you work. So this is the most important
thing.
And in general, I like I like to live
here. I like I feel safe, me and my
family. So the things change in a fast
way. So I like to be here because I
follow the process. I follow the changes
and I I like it. I like it to be part of
the changes of the country. But we have
a lot of potential to still grow and
grow and grow not only uh in a football
but in other areas too in a business
area entertainment
uh so I'm feel so proud.
Thank you. Why not? We never know the
future. I never thought in two years
enough that I will play in Saudi Arabia.
Never thinking about that. But life is a
box of surprises. So we never know
what's going to happen. But
I make in my life which is is to live
the present. I don't take decisions by
the future. So I live the present. The
present is good. The present is bright.
I'm very positive person. So I believe
the next years
the project continue to grow. Cristiano
will win something important in Saudi
Arabia. believe on that. And of course,
what I wanted to give the Saudi people
and especially the Al-Nasar fans a very
important trophy this year.
Why not depend of manufacturers, the
opportunities, but I'm not a regular
person to be honest. I'm thinking
different than than players. I don't say
I'm better than them, but I'm thinking
different. uh to be a coach. I can tell
you right now I'm never going to be a
coach. Never. Never. This is a strong
word but it's not in my plans in 5 years
10 20 but as you know the life is always
a box of surprises but
um projects and be part of uh the grow
of the country to be on a sides of the
country for sure I will be next to the
country because I'm not coming only for
play football I play for change of a
country cultural country so I'm a part
of that process
So, as I say so many many times, I
belong to Saudi Arabia. I'm Portuguese,
but I'm belong to Saudi Arabia.
Now, what I want to say it's continue to
support Cristiano, continue to support
Salasar, continue to support Portugal
national team. Believe
uh because this year I believe that
we're going to do it very very important
season. So the past is the past. Let's
focus on the present. The present will
be good. Thank you so much, Christian.
Thank you guys. Thank you guys."

losing to Galan and LeBron now LeBron

threes ju the wolf LeBron and franos
stupas LeBron from Spain stupa from
Argentina what a
combination what a combination Lebron
after a short experience on the left
hand side of the court now going back to
the right to play with stoa
first tournament for them as a team
joining forces this
season and in their first week competing
they are in the final spot today they
have a monster in front of them the
number On's the King aruro coo and the
moer
Tapia the kings of Kings in Premier
paddle number ones in the
rankings and trying to get some Revenge
here in the re season P1 tournament they
lost in the finals one year ago but
today it could be a different
story it's been a complicated week in
riet a lot of
rain but finally here we are with the
final match of the week the final match
of the tournament unfortunately we won't
have the finals in the women's side B
Gonzalez had to retire due to an
injury so the title goes for Ari Sanchez
and paa Jose Maria the number one in the
women's side see now the other number
onesia can repeat the same story
here ju Leon what a player what a
fantastic
player white and gray uniform for Leon
and St black uniform for konia here they
come to the main Court of this P Rush
arena in Riad for the official picture
say cheese guys there go the Cal before
the
storm and now we'll have afternoon
welcome to the final okay
respect okay
soia winning the Coos choosing to
receive to serve kapia will be serving
for the first time stupa and Leon will
be receiving thank you everyone for
joining the finals and the entire
tournament the season opener of the 2025
Premier pattle season and this is a road
to the final Quon Tapia knocking down CA
NS B in the
quarters then josas and ru and then Jas
and NATO yet to drop a set on the other
side we have stupa and LeBron also yet
to drop a set in the entire tournament
compano Sanchez Dino Garo and then
Cardona oxburger not an easy road to the
finals at all for stupa and
LeBron they actually lost a set in the
[Music]
semi-finals against Cardon oxburger the
team that beat for example Chingo Gand
the number twos and probably the biggest
Rivals
Foria LeBron was playing at the end of
the season with Martin Dino they split
and now they're playing together with
Franco stupas but first things first the
number one the King aruro coo born in B
190 for him very tall player as a lefty
always playing on the right side of the
court if you're new to the sport you
have to know that if you're a lefty you
always play on the right side of the
Court born in
2002 and sharing the team with AIA quo
moving now to Miami so big question mark
around guo and he's level big decision
from aruro guo moving from Spain where
you have all the players all the coaches
and you train really hard to move to
Miami to invest in a new project to try
to make it grow also the sport in in the
US and so far it's working first
tournament first final so uh nothing to
complain about playing with a magic man
if furo quo is a strong and very
complete player this guy is pure magic
pure
talent atin Tapia born in katar
Argentina 179 for him playing on the
left hand side of the Court the backand
player big smash but again the magic
that's the most beautiful thing about
Tapia an absolute Genius of the sport
for many players and for many fans the
best in the world I would put also in
that conversation coo and also Al Galan
Al Galan losing earlier in the
tournament but they've been dominant so
far these two being number ones almost
for two years ready trying to go now for
the third one in a row and they lost one
year ago here in the
finals trying to win this tournament for
the first time the r season
P1 time for us to go to the other side
of
theet because we have a new team a new
combination and look who's there Mr
Christiano
Ronaldo one of the
goats he's been here the entire week he
just Lov
tattle game for the D Brothers one of
the two best Portuguese players and he
is here saying yes yes I'm going to
enjoy the finals pretty good friend to
aruro quo for example they did a nice
video on social media last year and the
every time he has a chance he goes and
play
padle the opponents franos St pasuk also
from
Argentina number five in the rankings
he's so quick he is really
quick flying around the court probably
one of the quickest players alongside
Kino very physical he doesn't have a lot
of power compared to arur quo for
example or or Gan but he has a super rul
he goes to the fence always with this
beautiful overhead brushing the ball
creating angles and again flying very
fast very fast the transitions from
stupa very quick and now
joining the wolf very
talented Quan Leon the wolf you will see
how whenever he goes for a smash and
gets the point people go
oh such a talented player and again he
he was playing always on the right side
of the court and he said I want to try
something new I want a new challenge and
he went to the Batman side of the court
to play with Martin Leno it didn't work
you cannot also say it was a failure but
it didn't work in my opinion Leon is
better when he plays on the right side
of the court and now he decided to go
back there go back home let's say to
play with Franco stuk and so quite a
good combination stupa and the LeBron
this is Charlie pooni Carlos psoni their
coach also from
Argentina following mainly STA and they
say Gustavo
PR aruro Coo's coach they have two
coaches coo is working more
with and Canal working with Tapia this
is Peter CL from Belgium hello Peter
have a good one and we will go to the
V we have the technology also available
just like in any other sport players can
go to the V you have two challenges per
set if you win the challenge you keep it
if you lose a challenge you have one so
on and so forth until the end of a
set camera angles of this cattle Rush
Arena and the Beautiful green SE it's
very typical from this tournament where
we at season P1 and again it's been a
long and complicated season but we're
ready to have a big final with a big
special
guest the one and only Cristiano Ronaldo
and all the fans here as well thumbs up
time to
enjoy Monday finals Monday Monday
finals in 2024 the conversation was
Chalan kapia who's going to be the
number one at the end of was Quon Tapia
the one dominating but it was basically
a two teams conversation but now it's a
different story we have these two
joining forces playing together stupa
and
LeBron and getting the final the first
tournament is going to mean a lot of
points Leon could be actually the only
player to get backto back championships
here backto back tournaments he won a
2024 playing with
[Music]
r at season P one p rusher in a final
stage was talking now to Le he was
say I need you to be smart I don't want
you to go for crazy shots sometimes the
adrenaline you know it's final say you
want to go for more you want to prove
yourself and you go for risk decisions
risky shots not the day to do it
talking about the the
wind in which direction is moving today
is not raining which is fantastic after
a long and Horn weak in
Rat talking about the volle
we go for the eight the eight means
eight out of 10 trying to be consistent
not to play Bad volleys eight out of 10
every single time have the chance to go
for a nine or a 10 okay perfect but
always there good
level time to enjoy the first final of
the Season
Leonia who will take the
trophy we you have the green light fast
in your seat belts grab something to
drink something to eat play sit back and
enjoy 50
L and the first to the first point of
the tournament the first point of the
finals goes for k
flat smash from Mia down the line back
to back very quick 30
love that's what we call a chaso it's a
flat smash flipflop
shot and now again from uro coo this
time blocked by
stoa short smash from LeBron 4 and
another Chun another flip flop shot from
Tapia make it to
goes aulo it's always a good idea to go
to the fence you never know what bouns
you're going to get a winner from coo
and the perfect start from the number
ones
kapia and hold to
love if you're new to the sport you will
see how you have some glasses in the
back and then some part of the court
with a fence the ball has to bounce
first on the court and then it goes it
can go to the back or to the side walls
or to the fence you can play the ball
after that second bounce off the fence
or off the wall so that's why I'm saying
it's always a good idea to go to the
fence because if you go to the back wall
the bounce is going to be very clean
you're going to be able to read it if
you go to the fence it can bounce
anywhere take your seats please thank
you franos stas serving for the team for
the first time
good volley again this time from aruro
coo I mean he's 190 so he covers a lot
of space just a matter of one second
he's there he blocks it and then he
placs it into the
corner yet to score points
good Wy there he goes Franco
stas watching live on red bu TV watching
live in Premier padle
[Music]
four players at the net switching sides
STA and LeBron and the Final Smash from
uro KO you're staying short which is
going to be very good for Franco
stas big jump and the dunk
look at
that super smash from mapia the ball
finds the back and jumps Sky
High 30
all first serving game for stupa Leon
and already with a critical point this
one
from the back
hand more than good
40 that's the only way you got to play
to Perfection when you're facing the
number ones Leon going from the right
side to the back hand side and making a
jump copy paste from
AIA 4 30 a chance to tie things up
he goes again the block from AIA this
time
[Music]
up scoring same as in tennis so now we
have a
duice have to win a couple points in a
row to get the
game Mr Magic Man I will stop you
sta joining the party
now down the line he
goes perfect smash over aturo you have
to make a jump if you want to make it
you want to take it back to your place
to your court over ATO plus the Jump
Plus the arm and the
racket lock lcky
break lucky break for
AIA clipping the tape and they will have
a break
point those are the ones you say sorry
but deep inside you you know you really
know you will take
them it's actually a ju it was an
advantage for sua and Leon
this time Vette says
no using the side will stupid a nice
shot and now Leon doing the
same easyy
easyy say because that Back Fence it's
four meters high so whenever they dunk
it like that it's a point for you point
is over and you call it
patro hard complicated game for stupa
and
LeBron and they will have a break
point chasing it hunting you down quo
and Tapia too high from stoa allowing a
Tapia to jump to get the kicks Smash and
to bring it
back the L was perfect from AAP but the
block finds the
glass could wait to S to save the first
break point of the match juice number
four first game for guon Tapia was a
hold with love not losing a single point
And now when stupa and Leon serving it's
getting complicated
[Music]
right from the line LeBron
Pia makes it in and sta with the m the
court to finish the
point we had to wait until the end to
see if that Tapia Scotch was going in or
not good Port down the line from the
wolf nice save from Tapia but at the end
of the day if you're one V2 you're going
to be unprotected just like it happened
now to aruro
can they close it
down no they can't use
nice ball to the fence again from Tapia
smart enough sometimes it's better just
to let the ball fly to the back and then
wait for the bounce to have an easier
ball and is a shot to go this time
Crossing creating the angle going to the
fence and getting another break point
for the team
I
don't they will go to the V STA and
LeBron saying that the ball was in the
Empire is saying it was out first
challenge of the
match um that's close I think it was in
I think it was in honestly if stupa and
Leon right they will keep the the two
challenges if they lose it they will
have only one until the end of the set
let's see what the VOR
says V is something new to the
sport third year that we have it but
very new overall so it was in we were
right both St Leon and I I'm going to
take that win according to the video the
BS in first serve so we will have a
first serve and ston will keep the
second the two
challenges still a break point though
for qu Tapia
aruro coo jumping and dunking it for the
break look at that reaction from the
King they W it so
bad winning
[Music]
mentality winning so many tournaments in
2024 losing the finals to kinet and John
S but here they come again first
tournament and they won it so bad
Tapia is on fire today Tapia is doing
Tapia things and that's never
good no block from
stoa I think that probably LeBron was
going to get that
one I guess we will never know but out
looking everything konia
coach 30 love couple points away from
the perfect start from the number
ones last finder from sta it's so hard
they're closing head so hard so good
they cover every single space and if you
play the L you know there's the threat
of the smash so it has to be very
precise you have to be going for the
very last edge of the court and
sometimes you will get the mistake
soft touch too
soft playing with a
scoreboard 40 love going for the
Highlight
show that's going to be really short and
as mentioned as soon as you get the ball
short the king will punish you three
zero start for coo Tapia enjoying the
first set of the finals of this RI
season P1
spe foree
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
concentration concentration to be
focused to stay on the game and also
talking about the win how now when will
play some LS the will stop because they
have the win in the opposite direction
and it's going to be very tempting for
St and LeBron to go for the smash so
they were talking about being focused
being you know there to push to the net
in order to climb and to dunk it with a
recovery
like this very tempting for Leon just
like plant just like plant tempting
short Lop LeBron goes for the smash and
uro quick enough to go there to the net
to cross the court run and then easy m
long the ball is flying the wind is
pushing toward
air 305 this could be a good chance for
sta LeBron to get at least one game on
the
board what a ruler
again 30
all so high I mean look at how he goes
up there takes it plays it to Perfection
to the fence now good serve from Juan
Leon on the shotting paddle the serve
you're not going to win a lot of points
like in tennis but Point moments a good
serve he give you some
answers and they have the
game Tapia lead three games to 3-1 for
Quon
Tapia that could be a conf booster for
these
two build some momentum stupa and
Leon Charlie bson their coach watching
absolutely
everything going to stupa trapping him
in the corner stupa was there trying to
do whatever he could to get the ball
away but Goyo was going there and
they're punching him one two three times
just to get the point
30 love when tapion are serving they're
very dominant it's really hard to get
points from
them and now the good service from the
King uro goo 40 love another clean game
for kapia
slicing it into the net franos yet to
get his a game today for one coo Tapia
the number one leing getting closer to
the first
set
[Music]
for for
[Music]
gona o joining you in the broadcast
commentating this epic R season P1 final
41 coo
Tapia look at wind it is you can see
that fan having some misses With the
Wind serving against ston
so quick Tapia so so quick
Tapia dodging that smash from stupa and
then going back to the net and boom out
of the Court
bye-bye what a save again from Topia
trapped in the corner but he resist
everything and the Final Touch from
LeBron trying to go for the fancy finish
stays
short that difference from to you cannot
imagine how hard it is to be there close
to the fence
unprotected that's going to jump that's
going to be more than good from stoa but
coming back to that short drop shot from
Leon the previous Point remember the
conversation between him and poon at the
beginning of the match the coach was
asking not to go for anything crazy
especially in a final whenever you're
playing gu on Tapia you got to go for
the safe play not for the risky and
beautiful
shot pushing it too
much that slicing forand L from Juan
LeBron was a thing of a beauty pure
[Music]
class
40
4030 fighting for every single point on
in
sta not the easiest match
today this is something that we've seen
a lot in uro quo recently especially and
of the second half of the season in 2024
how he's improving from the back he has
always been very powerful and very
dominant from the back
line but now it's a different monster
it's a different monster from the back
line defending playing quality lobs
resisting that's why probably he's the
most improved player
quo the jump doesn't leave the
court and that's going to give LeBron
another chance to finish the
point 42 Leon St I thought goo was going
to Dun that one he's doing it nine out
of 10
times couldn't take it and that's a game
for the number
threes in that race for the number one
we will also have a race for the number
two stupa and LeBron making it to the
finals now getting more points and
Chalan losing the
quarters I don't believe
you Tapia flying for the smash but
living it short for LeBron
[Applause]
there you go the
wolf Tapia was ready too high that Banda
from LeBron was the one that you play
just to send the problem to the other
side of the net but Tapia was more than
ready cutting the court reading the play
and stupa was uh like a keeper facing
three Strikers and no
Defenders pure power
mamao that was a rocket coming to
LeBron and it's too long again from
LeBron nothing happening for Leon and
sta when receiving and another hold for
kapia and just like that the number ones
are only four points away from
[Music]
sec
[Music]
[Music]
foree for
[Music]
shot that you execute to put some extra
power very similar technique to a Banda
with using a bit more speed and power
going to the back end of Arturo Koo so
go to that corner it's very hard to do
because actually coo pushes to the net
you will never stay back and find him in
the corner but whenever you have the
chance LeBron says Charlie Pon go for
that
shotur back
[Applause]
hand 50 stupa and
LeBron playing a moss Wing game if they
lose it we will have the first set for
Kia good bounce off the fence from
LeBron Tapia was waiting for the ball
but it didn't drop in a good way for the
Argentinian
[Applause]

love what a smash now 40 love a quick
game for sta Leon and they needed it
important for them to stay alive in the
set and they will have it 53 # not with
my serve you want to win the set okay
you do it but that's going to be with
your
serve closing the doors to Pon but now
quo and Tapia serving for the
set three points now three points away
the Chas the flipflop shot from Austin
Tapia 15
love what a speed
spinning slicing B through St LeBron
Tapia back to back winners 30
love the number ones are
pushing between the legs goes LeBron but
it flies just in good shot from the wolf
what a save from aruro coo but nothing
you can do with that shot from LeBron to
the
corner pure CLA this point from LeBron
between the legs and then the Finish to
the corner

set M hit from LeBron
for that smash from LeBron was so bad

dunit point for St a chance to get the
first game of the second set
and they do it first three mistakes from
quo in one
game but he will be back he always is
back R season P1 what a tournament
complicated week with a lot of
rain unfortunate but the premium P team
putting an enormous effort every single
depoint in order to have a really nice
final like the one we're having now that
quo the number one's making it again to
the finals in RI just like in
2024 Leon also was part of that finals
back then playing with Ali Galan now
sharing the court with a Argentina and
the new porner Franco
stas and speaking of Franco stas showing
some moves
Franco stas known as the king of the
Middle East the king of the Middle East
he
won in Qatar in the major playing with
Martin Dino in 2023 he won in Egypt last
season in the P2 playing with Mike young
West can he do it again here can he
conquer another country
what a
smash Sky High
and now the one smashing it hard is Juan
LeBron
30 30 all this could be the moment for
stupa and
LeBron on going to the net now stba has
to go to the right side of the cour
switching sides to
[Applause]
Pon unfortunate unfortunate they were
fighting for the first break point of
the match stup and
LeBron went for the angle stupa found
the
net and you could hear the vamos from
konia showing how important that point
was hey
[Music]
[Music]
use last
fighter a game of inches this one the
difference between being perfect and
being long
couple inches but they're closer getting
closer than in the first set St and
[Applause]
Leon one and the
fans at this point rooting for St and
LeBron you can also always see how
people get involved with the under dos
in this case St
Leon after this game we go through the
calendar that per has for us going to a
lot of
countries look at that
P look at that
P can you stop dapia can you just stop
going back from behind the line and the
ball going to Qatar from R to Qatar mama
that was
mental going for the tiita that's a shot
that we use in paddle in order to go to
the that you can use a lot to go over
your opponents but also the chikita the
ball drops there the opponent has the
ball be low than it the only option you
have is to play it high and as soon as
you play it high they will P to the net
they will be waiting for you and they
will get a
point classy very classy instead of
going for quatro because probably the
ball was not so close to the net aruro
spins around plays with the back end
goes to the fence and gets a bounce
[Music]
[Applause]
from
franos the Off the Wall smash
AKA hey
that's the chikita we were talking about
how they push to the net now they win
the attacking position they open up the
door good ball good Gano to the
fence smart really smart St and Leon to
close every single
door moving KO and Tapia at the net
massive
next first
between and Tapia goes the wolf one
[Music]
Leon two games there was a lot of things
since a big gap between Koo and Tapia
Tapia went to the fense to block that
ruler from stupa on the other hand you
had quo way

buenos Italy bad R Malaga Scandinavia
Madrid Paris Germany roddam Milano new
Giza Dubai Mexico and
Barcelona 24 tournaments in this one and
only 2025 season in premium paddle and
this is only the first
stop flat smash it's paying off a lot
it's been the fourth time that we see
aop using this kind of flat Smash down
the line
too much trying to get the win and the
winner of the return it
on got to be better than
that to the
next those are the ones that you just
basically cannot afford when you're
playing the number ones and then serving
and you lost the first set you got to at
least play the point
not make too many unforced errors
obviously here to say from
here back to back smashes from Papito
little paper franos stas his nickname in
Spanish papelito because he flies on
court he's very quick
classy very classy as cheeky as you can
be on the
Finish that's ice cold from Juan Leon
[Applause]
missing it missing it stuper he wanted
to play the ball to the net putting it
to
sleep finding the wrong post coat here
look at that the jump and he tried to
play the ball to bounce and then to go
to the net Tapia was going out already
to catch the ball through the door it
didn't happen
405 no PES fromo the point stays
in last fighter from coo good call from
Tupa Leon was about to hit the ball and
then the call from his
team right decision another game for the
number three is
COO and Tapia not in the best moment
down in the second set but still set
up
[Music]
foree foree
we didn't have any single break point so
far in the second
set upia from
downia from downtown
and now sta more than
ready they're B they are here to
play quick hand from sta to save the
first one and then to be close to the
net after this match from
coo getting also some energy from the
crow feels like here the paddle Rush
Arena and defense from rette some more
paddle they went the third
set sleep back yeah it's sleepy Franco I
know not getting a clean bounce off the
back W there sta
unlucky LeBron going for the smash
sending it for th and getting another
Point much better much much
better that's LeBron we
know can they do
it they have a break
point oh what a fake what a fake say
you're right that was
Madness look good that
Madness so smart everyone was expecting
a hard
shot now the chikita placing the angle
out showing all the
repertoire number one for a
reason hard moments your opponent's
pushing you're facing a 30 all situation
and then you go for a beautiful fake
shot down the line and then the angle
I mean when you're good you're
good that was close but it was out
no was saying LeBron don't go through
the door Franco please stay stay stay
but stupa was convinced he went out
Bronco 0
[Applause]
305 they got to play well now St and
Leon usually qu and tap are good to get
the breaks in the right
moments you feel like you have a chance
you're there close close close but at
the end they save the situation and they
punch you where you going out but
nothing you can do good PES this time
going down the line LeBron 40 we saw
another pess in the previous game going
to the other side crosscourt this time
going to the other direction
he went for the magical
touch they didn't get it game again for
St lion 43 we're approaching now the
final stretch of the second set
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
spe
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
a much better second set from St
but even if feel they're better now even
if stupa and Leon are finding something
strategically so far they didn't have a
single break point so they need to do
even better in order to have a chance
against the number one s on
Tapia and again I'm telling you whenever
the number
ones know there's an important moment of
the match they have something extra and
I'm waiting for for that something extra
to come at some point in the second
set that
hurts ouch a little present a little
souvenir from Riyad
what a block from quo what a block quick
hands using the racket as a shield but
not only blocking the bat but also
placing it between Leon and
sta yeah goes for that one but is not
going to be able to get
it 4
15 PES from quo LeBron missing the door
game for tap again from the
King four games a piece and
now the this game the next game my
goodness how important it
is pressure on for ston
what an angle but too
short feels like the
[Music]
moment super blocks from Tapia and the
Finish
AIA shining now the mozer playing some
music couple blocks and then the finish
I'm telling you whenever you got a big
good day you're the
best oh good ball good Vol slicing it to
the
point point that one with st
LeBron
catching on the way good ball from Juan
LeBron probably the forand from tapio
was too high getting LeBron the chance
to push to get closer to the net and to
attack
LeBron LeBron to the net 3040 the number
one s Tapia with a break point
where you're pushing to the net toia
stay back LeBron going for
theur doesn't take it what a way to save
a break
point he was close he was really close
can't imagine a lot of stup and LeBron
fans now being
like that was
close pushing it
[Applause]
wide doesn't understand how
Tapia in the semi stupa and LeBron had
to face two match points Cardon and
oxburger with a couple of chances to be
in the finals they didn't do
it surviving always T and
LeBron nice fake
smash Juanito LeBron what a moment to do
it Juan LeBron squeeing
it love the of the Court saving a set
point and fighting in the finals Tupa
and Leon
[Music]
fore
[Music]
spee foree
[Music]
[Music]
let's go for the first point of this
game and now the number once with a back
against the wall in the second set
serving to stay
[Applause]
alive they had it they just had
it I mean if you're going to lose a
point it's better to do it this way
forcing K to do a nice defense a nice
pick up and then going for the smash
stayed short but at the end of the day
you got to go for
it effortless fromo and LeBron is ready
LeBron is ready LeBron is having
fun yes sir 5
brushing the ball for this over the
fence and look at that
save face bumping
it feels like it's far away but it's
only three
[Applause]
points whenever he catches the ball he
CPS the ball in The Sweet
Spot daia just destroys the ball it's
impressive how much the ball jumps and
go to the sky in
Riad he went for the flat
smash he found the net
30 this could be a good moment for Tapia
Ando for St
Leon and second serve
from the line goes toia living it
short the chump from Juan LeBron 3040
the first break point of the match was
stoa and Leon coming in the ideal moment
set point stoa
LeBron thank you and they do it
to send it to a third and final set here
com
St the final push finding the net that
hurts that hurts Leon in
sta now you got to go again
[Music]
probably a little bit unthinking the
previous Point missing the return a
chance for five games a piece they had a
set points to
byon and now they survive the number one
showing why they are the number
ones and we keep rolling in the second
set
good dunk again now from Franco
stas they're going for the smashes some
sometimes and uh it's not paying off
unless you get a good L and you can
really go for it it's not worth it going
for the smash because just waiting for
you closer than it
fishing also when you're playing a final
the ADR makes you go for it you want to
go you want to finish the point as soon
as you
can how to take the right decisions it's
not the same playing now than doing it
in the first
rounds here again but this time it's
money in the bank for from franos stas
305 great B great ball from
Tapia he was ready blocking and then
when LeBron went to the middle to play
that back can it was too easy for Tapia
the down line shot was unprotected and
the free empty Corner
4 fans are going wild they say one more
one more one more point to secure the
tie
Breck he's pting so much
power all day long during the T
LeBron and we will have
[Music]
[Music]
new for
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
LeBron and stupa
legs on fire we need
energy we need some energy in this game
they had a set
point and now at least they will play a
tiebreaker in the second set let's see
what the number ones have to
say lucky break for stupa leaping the
net making it awkward for
they are again within three
points perfectly placed into the cor
what a love that's what we got a perfect
love I mean look at that bouncing in the
edge of the Union between the side wall
and the back wall there's absolutely no
place to play to place the racket
between the glass and the ball love
[Applause]
30 it's unfair it's unfair
you think okay I'm at the net that was a
good love over Topia and then he does
that a three point again from
sta ones you have to stop
doing I'm just still thinking on that
and off the world smash with the back in
from T he goes for the line he goes from
the line he goes to the back for
3040 and yes we will have a second set
point for
ston thank
youo lives it short and the on

final
set one break for St 11 on

12 but again it's a match where you have
to be very precise in the key moments
and it feels like ston found something
they were talking about the lob over goo
frustrating the Lefty it's working it's
really
working little short little short 15
first set for coo Tapia the second one
for stupa
LeBron only one set to play and one
Championship to be
claimed 5
back to back short
smashes 1530 1530 Quia putting some
pressure just the beginning of the third
set no need to go for those
shots patience was working it was paying
off couple times they went for a
powerful hit and it's not working you
have to also take into account that at
the beginning of the finals
we had some sun it was during the day so
the boat was flying FAS it was warmer
now it's getting late it's getting cold
humid the ball's not going to jump as
much and now another Point Foria 1540
they have a break point just to
start this could be hard for ston you
make such a strong effort to send the
match to a third set and you give away
your sered
[Applause]
no oh whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
whoa whoa whoa the point of the dman
from abin
taia the point of the tournament from
ainia no no no no no no no no no no no
no no no no
no what was
that it was an easy DK for
LeBron and the DK the point of the
tournament probably of the
Season yes sir and he knows and he knows
[Music]
it get
know 50 l
had could have been too much I was
trying to recover from that point I mean
I just stand up believe with Tapia
did now we 30
love side booster from Leon quick hands
from uro to block
it and you're a Saudi fan waited the
entire week to watch this game
I mean with that shot from Topia you
already have your tet
covered and coo finishing the job in a
big way feels like that points fromia
gave them some extra energy extra
something now they're having
fun moving the ball creating
angles activating the go mode or a plus
[Music]
1,000 they need something again they
need to get back on track back to that
second SEC Rhythm that
pace it's only one break it feels like
more now because they're playing better
Quia and after that point you stay
like punched
hurt got to keep going and now Tapia
dunking it but not going over the fence
for quatra on the other side of the net
he sends it to his own place and it's
like a casual day you know the day at
the office for Tapia see come back here
baby this guy I
mean
405 first
get
[Applause]
him unlucky for Leon small touch there
at the net going straight into the fence
nice P from
sta post and in from Tapia that counts
that
counts going to have a better look here
if you go out you touch the post and
then it goes in it's a point for
you it's a point for you another shot
for the highlights you're going to make
a highlight shot highlight real only out
of tapus shots today in the finals
going to Tik Tok going to
Instagram important game this one
especially for stone I know the break
could be too
much me hit from
aruro going for the
smash and again the love over the king
is
paying L over at Duda
[Applause]
works that's a good way to redeem
yourself after having a mistake
good comeback from Muro
[Music]
great Point again for coot Tapia playing
little games and you cannot play the
games with
Tapia this could be too much this could
be too much but it's not going to happen
just yet qu Tapia missing the return
he's a Human After All not a
machine this match it's
good of the match from Leon and also the
tournament going back to the right side
of the court it's a different monster
there an absolute killer from the right
side of the Court
he's at 100% he can be within the top
four easily now PES but it's going to be
easy it's going to be more than easy for
Tapia the problem with a PES at this
level whenever you go to a club and
you're playing with your friends
probably you go and you play a PES and
it's going to be most likely
point at the pro level whenever you play
a portes and if it doesn't open too much
if you don't have a lot of power they
will be waiting for you just to tdge the
ball to the land and kill the point
[Applause]
Advantage
super okay
[Applause]
theet paying a big part
nowed a big
actor one for LeBron stupa now one for
Tapia and aruro and I remember talking
to a couple coaches Martin Carell one of
them explaining that it's not a
coincident that we're witnessing more
and more course touching the net shows
you how close the players are executing
the shots how precise they are how thin
the ball goes and obviously as precise
and thin that you get more chance you
have to touch the
net happy finding the net and the first

but that's going to be more than easy
for Franco
stas dunking it for
quatro beautiful shot though from aruro
saving it put close to his fit

again and again
papia
5 creating some Unstoppable angles
moving stupa even though after the
effort from stupa to give one more shot
to force uro to win The Point
again they reply the number ones
communication is key this time it was
Leon the war telling stupa not to even
touch the ball not to even think about
it
405 4
15 that's what you got to do you know
you have to play so precise to be so
close to the net that you're going with
the back end as soon as you don't be
smart enough with a chikita St so quick
that he's going to be close to then I to
block it and reclaim the attacking
position 43

big jump from uro but not good enough
Unstoppable that smash from
franasia 32 still a break up trying to
get for the first time the championship

B1
[Music]
foree for
foree Char P talking about the Tactical
part of the game and the how the love
over
aruro the love over atudo was working
during the second set they're not using
it the third one so back to that
original plan back to sending some LS
over aruro coo and then stupa was saying
yes but once we go over aruro we have to
make him play of an excellent to our
perfect B we cannot miss after winning
the net
approaching the end of the first final
of the
Season stoa flying and Lon smashing it
hard 5 good
combination mod paddle the back inside
player building the point and assisting
the right side player to finish
we always say that the right side player
usually is the Strategic one the one
setting up the pace and the point in
order for the backend to finish to be
the one finishing the point aggressive
was the opposite and this time again
copy paste le iton le it on
Leon 153
[Music]
30 go Point moment running St but trying
to get the break
back that's the L that we're talking
about over aruro making play they send
him
back always TOS Areo this time the L was
a glass fighter it was too
long it's working it's working quo is
not doing anything with the
overheads it's not war him anymore he's
not going to go for the smash
and it's an open door to go there and to
force them
[Music]
back and again the net and again and
again and again the net today we've seen
a lot of
those it's a dece
unfortunate last fighter and now opening
the racket trying to get some uh
different movement different
motion look at that for quatro from coo
as cheeky as you can be on the Finish
the rainbow shot isn't
it stepping closer and
Bam quatro climbing the fence
over going for a walk here re at that
ball game for TAP 42 and Le already
serving again how smart boo is to wait
for that ball he knew that the ball was
not too high so he placed it Cross Court
slicing it going towards
sta L
15 we Downs probably because of the spin
that stup was using that
Banda soon as the ball goes down it's
going to jump
going for the kick
smash using the spin from the Contra and
after a Long Point St saying hash now
more bye-bye Chow
noos see you
[Music]
[Applause]
later take that Tapia 4050 take that
one stup with no mercy at
allia just getting the racket for some
protection there's absolutely nothing
you can
do apologizing sta
sportsmanship what a match from stupa
and Leon so solid
okay now Tapia is the one punishing
LeBron LeBron finding the end of the
Court going for the smash but living a
choice foro in a weird point it's a
lefty

Premier paddle enjoying the first

break 43 and
serving but what a match from LeBron and
stupa I had big expectations from these
two when they announced that they were
playing together in
2025 so far it's even better than
expected what a combination I think
there will be playing many many finals
winning
tournaments B bam bam bam B bam bam the

Matrix mode love 15

15 can be out watch it keep an eye on it

305 the only thing that tap and coo have
to do is holding the serve and they will
be the champion team
RI no P from uroos the ball staying in
405 405 and this is now the moment where
that point that block from AIA in the
1540 at the beginning of the first set
the third set the super block the point
of the tournament now
how important it is how that break could
be that
decider 43 putting too much power in
that
volley good move though the ball was
high he tried to go closer to an head to
attack and he placed it too
low
dancing dancing Leon to DOD a ball good
moves in defense and stupa and LeBron
they're showing something else
today stupa going quick to the net to
avoid the the bounce then LeBron
dancing sta flying high and forcing
Tapia to make the unforced
[Music]
error Advantage
[Music]
yeah is I mean did you see how fast he
went from the back line to the net to
block that shot from Alia but this guy
is
flying this ball oh dur
[Applause]
midle goes the crowd here in the panel
Rush
Arena Leon going for the smash both and
going for it almost like two trains
colliding but it was good enough to dunk
it I don't even know it was sto
super flying to the net
what a pick up from Leon from the autog
ground from the lead Metra station but
then quick
from no protection whatsoever for stupa
at the net every single point has a
class touch shows the skills and the the
talent from these four players what a
final what a way to end the first
tournament of the season
[Music]
power pure power every single time he
goes for
the finds
something going below the ball
underneath it to create the angle to
place the racket
down look at
that those are the ones advantage
again so many free points for Co Andia
coming from STA and LeBron today and he
knows how important that was
[Applause]
good ball Jaso flipflop shot from AIA
and the winner to make it 53 and the
number ones are only one game away from
the
[Applause]
championship Point tournament this
one listen to the crowd Tapia Tapia they
go crazy easy with a magic man important
tournament for coo after moving to Miami
everyone was asking is that the right
choice is he going to deliver and
perform as he always does and coo said
it in an interview before this
tournament this opener this season
opening we had is a big big proof to me
and for the rest to show them that I can
do
it trying to cover the middle
so unpredictable sta you never know if
it's going to play the rule if he's
going to go with a soft Anda down the
middle what a jump from aapi and then
dodging the fence now the
block and the Finish from LeBron I
mean the level and the P that we're
witnessing today look at this jump from
AIA not only catching it high but also
then going down to miss the
fence unreal I missed P paddle so much I
missed it so
much moving the rest flicking it
[Music]
[Music]
and behind the back he try to go for the
crazy recovery AIA he was out of
position he thought the ball was going
fores at the end he realized that it was
not going out of the Court he came back
he took it but at the end he was out of
guard going for the fake smash to B too
soft
[Music]
the fans giving tapy another chance and
he will take
it close to going P Quadra that smash
from sta he
didn't going straight into Tapia and
Tapia smashing it hard The Punisher
Tapia going for the match point the
number one's
[Music]
here
ohuro it's always him it's always the
king going out of the Court behind the
back bouncing in and
out up and down now uro
coo one super point from Tapia one super
point from
coo and this is why they are the number
ones this is why they are the
Kings Match Point Championship point
for the block from K now Tapia joining
the party but he has to go back
the smash from stoa what a way to save
the championship
[Music]
[Applause]
point that was hard you go to the right
side to fly and to execute a perfect
smash
[Applause]
[Music]
really high L from
marur ha let the ball BCE he
didn't second match point for go and
Tapia who would have thought after
playing a perfect match St missing
to close the deal to get the first win
in the
season not going to happen just
yet n first
what a ball from St opening the racket
faking
AIA not easy to
do almost hting LeBron on the
way that was really close
de effort de
effort that's what you got to do stupa
going out of the Court LeBron for the
pickup but
obviously the court was
empty but was wide
empty and we're back to the as number
[Applause]
four to the fence goes aruro goes atin
Tapia
really smart he was uh anticipating that
shot it flew too much and then slap to
the
fence
fif what a beautiful four back hand down
the line from
AIA going Roger
style and we will have another
tournament
point uro and Tapia to win the first
tournament of the
Season here comes the king out of the to
finish the
job your
2025 R season P1
Champions the number ones back on
business 63 57 and 63 for goo endia

week be at the Champions are here the
first one of the season winning this
tournament for the first time they lost
a final one year ago and here they are
getting even more points and we're
defending only the points from the
finals and they will get an extra amount
of points in the rankings making that
difference between them and the rest
even bigger big shout out to stupa and
Leon for the entire tournament they
played
also an impressive match an impressive
performance today been close being
really close but at at the end of the
day it's always
them it's always them it's always
yunia a big hog that says it all and a
big thank you to you watching from the
other side of the screen following the
entire Tournament being patient with the
rain delays but always supporting the
tour always supporting the players and

from the players to you show showing on

have a lot of
[Music]

tournament of the
season in a few minutes we'll have a
look at the numbers the stats the stats
the match summary and we will have the
trophy ceremony here live with all of
you
and coo said it I was uh trying to send
also a message to the people questioning
my decision to go to Miami or am going
to get the best results I'm I going to
be able to perform as I was doing it
when I was living in Spain well I think
the answer is pretty clear
clear and choto Alan also will have to
keep an eye on stupa LeBron they
were closing the quarterfinals losing to
W and
Cardona and just like that stupa and
LeBron are in the conversation in that
race for the number two spot in the
rankings
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
seems like now kab has some pain in one
of his uh right hand fingers getting
some protection now
[Music]
AIA in my opinion the MVP of the match
today aruro was not playing at his best
but whenever Tapia is playing good and
the goo's not or the opposite it's
enough to win championships Bella said
it Fernando said it a couple of weeks
ago the thing making these two special
is that even when they're playing 70%
60% they're able to win and when one
player is not having the day or bringing
the a game the other one is pushing the
team and that's the key the combination
to Perfection these two have uh found
something they're making history they're
young and they have a lot of years ahead
of them it's hard to believe that
somebody's uh taking the number one away
from them anytime soon it can happen of
course it can happen
but it's hard it's hard it's really hard
these two are a fantastic Duo they
friends they perform well on court
whenever they have free time they also
spend time
together and that's the main reason why
they're just winning and winning and
winning breaking
records they could become perfectly one
iconic pair in the history of the sport
not only they are the number ones now
but they could write a big page of the
history of the of the SP I keep doing
what they're doing
[Music]

are you ready to hear the story of the
boy who transformed football conquered
all Trafford and became a
legend let me introduce you to Cristiano
Ronaldo it all started when Sir Alex
Ferguson the legendary manager of
Manchester United saw him play on a
friendly match against Sporting Lisbon
his reaction well he decided that he
needed that boy on the team right then
and just like that Cristiano was signed
for1 million making him the most
expensive teenager in the football
history at the time when Cristiano got
to Carrington he asked for his beloved
number 28 but Ferguson had a different
plan to give him the iconic number seven
this wasn't just any number it had been
worn by United Legends like George best
Eric anona and David Beckham christianos
sard as the ultimate motivation to prove
himself Sir Alex Ferguson became the
mentor who shaped the young Portuguese
Talent into the global icon that he is
today
Cristiano's debut for Manchester United
was nothing short of magical he came in
on the 60th minute against Bolton
Wanderers at old traford and in just 30
minutes he left the fans in awe even
George best one of the club's greatest
players said that it was the most
exciting debut he had ever seen the
transfer happened so fast that Cristiano
barely had time to prepare he arrived in
England without knowing a word of
English but we know nothing stops him
he bought a mansion in Alderly Edge
decorated it with a John Claude Van Dam
poster because yes he's a fan of action
movies and got straight to work
Cristiano wasn't just talented he was
relentless he'd show up an hour early to
training and leave an hour late that's
the dedication that creates Legends in
his first season chano cleaned up at the
awards Player of the Year young Player
of the Year and fans favorite player he
became the first player ever to win all
these Awards in a single season then
came 2008 the year Cristiano won all
individual Awards balonar FIFA World
Player pushka award for His stunning
goal against Porto in the Champions
League and that's how his Manchester
United chapter came to an end a young
boy arrived shy but determined took the
legendary number seven played
292 games and scored 118
goals and in 2009
he made history with a record-breaking
transfer 96 million EUR to join Real
Madrid but that's a story for another

any circumstances it's
easy should be the
goat actually actually it was it it was
actually it was Tom Brady no I'm kidding
it was you it
was his face man he was like wait what
but he go in in sports so yes all right"
K-oLr-43ejs,"Are you ready, guys?
I would say...
You?
4 for 6.
Let's go!
The GOAT.
The GOAT.
-Win...
-What?
Thank God he got that one right!
SIUUUUUU!
Hey, I'm Ronaldo.
And this is...
I'm joking.
We're gonna play a game
called ""Which GOAT said it?""
He'll read a question,
I'll guess which GOAT said it.
SIUUUUUU!
You wanna start? Me?
-You start.
-Are you ready, guys?
""Your love makes me strong,
your hate makes me unstoppable.""
Oh gosh...
That does not sound
hardcore enough for MJ,
I don't think Tom...
Maybe something you'd say.
No? You? Ronaldo.
-Yes, you're right.
-Okay, let's go!
MJ would say something
way more hardcore.
He'd be like:
""F*** the haters!""
Very good.
-Second.
-Let's see if I can go 2 for 2.
""There is no 'I' in team,
but there is in 'win'.""
That's a Tom Brady quote.
-Jordan.
-What?
Okay, that seems too nice for him.
-I got 1 for 2.
-Keeping score.
Oh boy...
""You need to think big.
I always believe
that nobody is better than me,
out on the pitch at least.""
The second you said the word ""pitch""...
-That was easy.
-Yes, it's me.
I don't know if Tom Brady calls
an American football field a ""pitch""...
He's right.
""Mentally, the only players
who survive in the pros
are the ones able to manage
all their responsibilities.
Everybody struggles in different ways.""
That one feels like
it could go any way...
Everyone struggles in different...
Tom Brady?
-Yes.
-Okay, okay.
3 for 4.
""I don't have to worry
what others think.
I talk when I want to.
Everybody knows who I am,
what I believe in.""
That is not Tom,
we'll put that down.
It's either MJ or Ronaldo.
I could see
either of them saying it, but...
I'll have to go with MJ.
-It's me.
-Really?
-But good...
-You're right, everyone knows...
That does sound like
something you'd say.
-We haven't gotten an MJ yet.
-Is it the fifth?
Yeah, I'm 3 for 5.
Statistically this should be MJ,
we haven't had one yet.
""Failure makes me work even harder.""
I mean any one of them could say that,
that one's pretty generic.
I'll go with MJ 'cause it's data.
-Yes.
-Okay, let's go!
-Michael Jordan.
-All right.
-Last one?
-Last one.
4 for 6.
""I feel an endless need to learn,
to improve, to evolve,
not only to please
the coach and the fans,
but also to feel satisfied with myself.""
Oh boy...
""The coach and the fans...""
I'm gonna go with... Tom Brady.
-Me.
-Ronaldo, wow.
There's so many Ronaldo ones in here.
All right, I was 4 for 7.
Look, my son is here.
-Your son's here? How's it going?
-Yes.
Jimmy, seven...
I got 4 out of 7.
Your turn.
Actually before we do this.
Did you see...?
No, Cris, come to me.
Cris, come here.
You're gonna help me.
Did you see
that LeBron played with his son?
Yeah.
You gonna do that with your dad?
Yeah.
You are?
Hopefully.
-Hopefully.
-Hopefully?
-Okay.
-He'll ask seven questions
and you have to guess
which of these three said it.
He got 4 out of 7.
He's got to beat 4 out of 7.
First question
for our boy Ronaldo over here.
""If you do the work,
you get rewarded.
There are no shortcuts in life.""
My son says...
It was Michael Jordan.
Not Tom Brady.
He's out for 1.
Let's go. I might win.
That did sound like...
He got three wrong.
Right?
You missed three?
-Yes, I missed three.
-Yes.
All right, next one.
I have my flaws too,
but I'm a professional
who doesn't like to miss or lose.""
Dad, you should know this.
It's yours.
-Or Jordan.
-I don't know what they're saying.
But...
Say it again.
I'll repeat the question.
""I have my flaws too,
but I'm a professional
who doesn't like to miss or lose.""
It could be Jordan.
Shall I try another?
Another...
But I think it's...
Or is it your dad?
Dad, remember.
Have you ever said that?
I talk a lot...
I would say myself.
Yes, you did say that!
All right, thank God
he got that one right!
SIUUUUUU!
SIUUUUUU!
-Good.
-That would've been embarrassing.
All right, whatever this one is.
""Talent wins games,
but teamwork and intelligence
win championships.""
I'm not 100%...
Him or him?
I think...
It was Michael Jordan.
I know that sounded like
a Tom Brady quote.
-Yes.
-Championships.
I know...
-Does that mean he's 1 for 3?
-Yeah.
Woah!
If he gets another wrong, we're tied.
All right...
Next question.
""I really do just want to win,
and that has and will continue
to be the reason that motivates me
and is the biggest factor
in my decision-making process.""
It has to be one of those two.
What's he holding up?
What do you think?
-I'm sure it's not you.
-It's him.
What do you think?
Let's see...
Tom Brady, correct.
-Yes.
-Okay...
What is that, 2 for 4?
All right, next one.
""Everybody has talent,
but ability takes hard work.""
I think that's yours.
Is it mine?
-I think I've heard you say that.
-But maybe I didn't say that exactly.
I've said something similar,
but not in that way.
This is why I will say Jordan.
You're correct.
Michael Jordan. He's on a roll.
Let's go!
""I know I am a good professional,
I know that no one's harder
on me than myself
and that'll never change
under any circumstances.""
It's easy.
It should be...
the GOAT.
The GOAT.
Actually it was...
Actually it was Tom Brady.
-No!
-I'm kidding. It was you.
His face was like: ""Wait, what?""
-Who is the GOAT in this sport...
-Yes...
All right.
So, how many more?
-Two more, right?
-Yeah.
Get this one wrong and we'll tie.
Have your dad throw.
You.
""Never say never
because limits, like fears,
are often just an illusion.""
It's in your hands.
Don't be like that!
Would you say it's his too?
That is correct, Michael Jordan.
SIUUUUUU!
Shocker!
He remembers when he says things.
-That was awesome.
-We won!
Yeah, you won.
But didn't win
in the million dollar match...
Just kidding.
Jimmy, it was a pleasure...
Likewise.
...to have you in my second home,
as I told you,
to meet my eldest son
and to speak with my daughters.
Any time you want to come here,
you are very welcome.
-Thank you, it was a pleasure.
-Thank you.
-You've been awesome.
-Keep doing this kind of stuff.
-Thank you.
-People love it.
Guys, Ronaldo was very hospitable,
I'm very grateful.
Just want to say this,
thanks for having me.
He took me to his house,
we filmed stuff.
-You're an amazing guy.
-Thank you, brother.
And welcome to YouTube!
Thank you very much."

the pitch this guy likes to build
suspense Mr Beast is no fool that's for
sure what's going on with Cristiano not
hitting all the dummies he hasn't
suffering until the end of the video he
knows how to this is how you know he's a
good YouTuber he's purposely missing so

5l8YJCzzryc,"I did 7 Days on a deserted island 7 Days
stranded on a raft 7 Days in underground
city 7 Days in abandoned city so brother
are you crazy next question next
question you think I'm going to beat you
[Music]"
aDF_ESN80r8,"What did you feel when I started the channel?
It’s crazy that LeBron is playing with his son.
Are you going to make that happen in the football world?
Which is your favorite one?
How did you feel
when you hit a billion followers across everything?
Do you think I'm going to beat you?
What you felt when you saw I was going to start a channel?
Yeah.
I knew it was gonna… Honestly, I thought you were gonna
do about 20 or 30 million in the first month; when you
did 60, I was like, oh my gosh.
It's like the most ever
gained in one month before. Before you
it was 20 million, and that was us, So sixty..
That was insane.
How long did it take take you to reach 60 million?
Probably 13 years.
Yeah. Took me like..
Do you think I’m gonna beat you?
Do you think? Be honest
NO!
It depends on what you start doing. If you start bringing in other footballers
and reacting to your best plays,
I think you’d crush it. If you find a rhythm,
you can make some killer content.
But this record is for you
I don't wanna beat that record, honestly
You have a billion followers; I wanna have a billion subscribers on YouTube.
Imagine.
Yeah, it would take a while, for sure.
It would take a while.
We have 324 million right now.
Did you see my youtube channel?
Of course
¿What do you think?
Obviously, you’re still a professional football player, so you have a lot going on.
I think you’re doing your best
I think your greater asset is anyone will film with you. You could do so many cool collabs,
kind of like this one.
You should have Tom Brady appear for a video, Speed, all these big names.
Also, something easy for you is like, after a big game,
you could just hop in front of a mic, do a quick
five-minute talk about what happened.That would be super
easy for you, but you’d have so many people wanting to know what you think, you know.
What do you think? Or....
Bro, can you imagine Ronaldo reacting to a video of
his top 10 goals? Can you imagine how crazy that would be?
You know that goal where you did a bicycle kick? I’ve seen that at least a hundred times.
I’d love to know what you were thinking
when you decided to do bicycle kick.
That would be great
I don’t think that would hard staff; do more football related things.
Because that’s why we love you.
How did you feel when you hit a billion followers across everything?
most-followed man on the planet.
It was good.
Good achievement,
,but I wasn’t surprised, to be honest.
I know the passion that the people have for me and for football as well.
Yeah,
For the the career I still do it,
I felt that passion, so it wasn’t a surprise.
I feel happy.
but in the same way no suprised.
I'm the same way. Every time I hit the marks it's like: cool
Yes, yes, yes..
Exactly.
Everyone tells me I should celebrate, and it’s like, why?
I feel the same way.
On YouTube, when people
get a video recommendation, you know the image that pops up?
Yes, they told me now.
The thumbnail.
I’m known for my thumbnails so
so I’ll give you a few tricks. Usually , you put your face in the thumbnail,
O, so whenever you take photos of your face,
keep your mouth closed.
I used to do this with my mouth open, and people hated it.
Oh. Really?
Yeah, they said it’s cringe.
So keep your mouth closed and get
some good high-quality shots of your face for your team
to use in thumbnails.
Got it, got it,
So you I want to
show expression, so you just like.
But it's cringe because there is 30 people watching.
Next Question, next question.
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
Where do you feel
the country you have the most..?
Most fans?
Oh, um, when we go
anywhere in South America, things get crazy.
One time we were in Chile,
and like we are in a hotel
and fans literally surrounded the hotel and started
knocking on every door
I'm sure you have weird things happening.
we had to leave the hotel and I think they had to evacuate it
it because so many
fans sit in the hotel lobby.
This mostly happens when we are un South America.
In the U.S., people are more chilled,
but when we go international,
they are like a hole different breed.
I guess it's because not
many famous people like really
our creators from our world visit South America.
So when they do, it’s a big deal.
Where do you live?
North Carolina. A tiny town
So there is good. It's cool
Oh, yeah.
I just... I live in my studio.
. We have a big studio where we film videos, and I live there.
I never leave.
The worst thing...
I assume you fly private everywhere.
Flying commercial
sometimes is brutal.
It's brutal, right?
It's like... uhhff
I don’t do it in so so many years.
I would pay money to see Ronaldo flying comercial
to see how..
The reactions
Imagine putting on some glasses and record
the reactions.
That would be awesome!
That is good content for YouTube
could you imagine if he had the Ray-Ban’s on recording
and then went out on a commercial flight;
the amount of photos people would ask for.
I mean, they’d have to cancel the flight.
A normal seat. Imagine.
To go and stay there
waiting to my…
No, he wouldn't do it because,
he is obviously way more famous than me.
If I sit in a normal seat, you have people
running up and down the aisle
asking for a photo, a photo...
With him, the entire plane would turn into
a Photo booth . It would be insane.
I'm thirty-nine
And a few months...
Okay. Almost forty.
You’re about to die!
What's it like?
I'm going to live until 100.
I just want to let you know.
And you know in football,
this is a long career
Because most of the time
people retire at 33, 34, 36.
You’re like the LeBron James of football.
Yeah. I wanted to ask you when you
think you gonna retire from this.
Never. Never.
Oh, good.
I’ll probably be doing when I’m 90
I’m like you; I want to live over a hundred.
I don’t know how, but with technological advances,
they have to find a way to slow down aging,
So hopefully...
You’re going to do this forever.
I mean, if I stopped, what would I do, watch TV?
Maybe you have another passion or
something that you…
I just enjoy building busineses; you know,
running the channel to me feels like building a company.
It's good. Good to know that
He is getting harassed by a fly!
Someone just clip this!
I see the fly over his eyes,
and I think it landed on him.
a very much.
I buried myself alive for seven days.
But you did?
Yeah
So this is my coffin
and they put twenty thousand pounds of dirt on me.
and I spent a week lying down in a coffin.
I’m under there.
Cristiano realizing what it means to be a YouTuber.
People knew it’s real, we time lapsed the whole thing.
But how you feel?
Horrible. I couldn’t move for a whole week.
There was a fly trap in the coffin too.
You didn’t move for a week?
Yes, just lying down there.
This is after seven days.
This is when they dug me up.
But you are like…
This is the doctor who pulled me out;
they thought I had a blood clot,
so a medic had to check when I came out.
How did you feel inside? bad?
it was horrible because I was in a coffin,
so the floor was wood, and my back hurt.
Your back, right?
Yeah
Yeah, so I did 7 days buried alive and also
spent 7 days in solitary confinement
in a padded room, with no interaction, no time.
Brother, you’re crazy, huh?
Yeah, that one was brutal.
Tyler, what else did we do?
I did 7 days on a deserted island, which made me want to die.
Then seven days on a raft drifting,
seven days, yes, and seven days in an underground city
seven days in an abandoned city...
... My fans love watching me suffer, so I do things
that make me miserable, and they find it funny.
Wow, It's crazy
So, this are the most hardest one?
This one?
No. What would you say are the hardest, Tyler?
(The solitary.That ones are crazy)
Yeah.
Which are the solitary?
Here, I'll show you.
(No one spoke to him in seven days straight)
No phone? Nothing? But where?
(In a white padded room)
Let me show you, it’s pretty wild.
when did we upload this video, Tyler? Is it an old one?
When did you start doing these, the videos and the channel?
Oh, I’ve been doing this since I was 11
S. So I’ve been doing it for about 15 years,
this is all I’ve erver done.
This is the solitary confinement one. So an entire...
It’s just me in this white padded room,
and I had no clue what time it is.
Oh, my God.
And it’s soundproofed.
Was this the hardest one?
Oh yeah, this one is so hard. The lights never turned off;
so you don’t see the sun or anything;
and see you just want to tell simulation.
And then,
there were 90 hours in, and that was all I had, so it was brutal.
So, that video for example. That got a hundred.
How many?
A 189 million views, 186.
And people loved it. They love watching me suffer.
Jimmy…so it’s kind of just fun.
Which video has more views?
The most-viewed… yeah, is it the Squid Game still?
Yeah, So yeah. We recreated Squid Game in real life,
and it got 600 million views.
I put 100 people in a circle, and the last
one to laugh won half a million dollars.
This one has almost half a billion views.
So this video 4% of the humans alive have watched.
So look at this: I said, I don’t care how long it takes;
the last one to leave the circle takes
the half-million dollars in the middle.
and it went on for weeks.
And people were just wondering,
how long will they sit in the circle?
That was funny.
Amazing.
What is your favorite one?
Oh, I like them all. I mean…
This video is the one that broke the internet.
It’s the most-viewed video on YouTube in just 24 hours.
so no other video in YouTube history has gotten more views in 24 hours.
We brought the biggest YouTubers on the planet
and put them inside a big cube.
So, all these really famous content creators,
who your kids will definitely know.
We built a huge cube and put them in there,
and said whoever laugh last,
could give away a million dollars
to one of their subscribers.
Okay, Okay
Basically, everyone was in there.
It’s like if you got the 50 biggest football
players and put them in a room, and had them do something.
It just broke the internet.
That video got 70 million views in 24 hours,
and people loved it.
Good good good.
Do you like other sports?
I love basketball.
Basketball?
Yeah
Do you watch basketball?
Not much.
I love watching Steph Curry shoot three-pointers from half-court.
Ahh, good.
And it’s crazy how LeBron it's now playing with his son.
: Are you going to make that happen in the football world?
Maybe. I'll see. He is fourteen now..
Maybe he’ll play when he’s 17, so you’d have to play for 3 more years.
Let’s see, let’s see how my legs are doing; we’ll see.
Your son is watching,
maybe we could ask him to help us out.
He knows more things than me, about this world, YouTube, he knows everything.
So,I heard this is your water brand?
Yes
What made you want to do it?
Basically, a good product.
A good quality water for me,
it’s the most important.
Doesn’t matter if it's water or supplemets for example.
If it’s a nice product, I want to be associated with it.
Makes sense.
Yes.

that we've called Cristiano's Secrets
let's get on with a first secret what's
one thing nobody knows about
Cristiano it's a tough one and our first
guest this evening is Renato
[Music]
Vega this is difficult because um I
think he's a very private person in a
good way I will say something that I
think already people already already
know that
he the way he is dedicated to his work
it's unbelievable even close the closer
you are to him so I will say this
because what is one thing that nobody
knows about Cristiano that you have seen
from playing with him in the national
team I don't think there many many
things that you guys don't know you
always around him to to know how his
life is so it's uh it's a tricky one and
look it is no other than Bruno
[Music]
Fernandez oh I don't know I don't know
something that you guys don't know it's
uh it's a difficult one it's a good uh
it's good dancing really really he has
he has he has some nice steps a great
dancer that he the way he is dedicated
to his work it's unbelievable even close
the closer you are to him what's up
something about Cristiano that most
people don't know based on your
experience playing with him on the
national
team one thing about Cristiano that no
one knows and here's our third guest for
the evening Bernardo
[Music]
Silva I think people know that he is
very disciplined and he likes to do his
his works when the time is right and and
everything has to be there I don't know
curiosity about Cristiano maybe that I
he doesn't eat he doesn't eat a lot of
times I think he he only eats like lunch
and dinner he doesn't make like small
meals I think I think that's a good
curiosity about him it looks like these
guys have a lot to share about Cristiano
that we've never heard about let's move
on to the second secret Cristiano's
Secrets if you could take any one
quality from Cristiano which one would
you
choose I always say this I probably go I
normally would say speed but we with him
I would go headers it's true that
Cristiano is one of the best headers in
the world what is one characteristic
about Christiano you would adopt if you
could shooting no the finishing the
technique of finishing actions I would I
would definitely have that this
technique is indeed from another world
if you could have any attribute from
Cristiano what would it be jump he jumps
almost 2 m i I don't know almost 3 m
yeah it's amazing uh a lot of attribut
he has good but for me the jump is wow
could Cristiano be a high jump athlete
these guys seem to know Cristiano really
well but they've forgotten his amazing
ability to do a perfect
Su Cristiano's
Secrets can you share a funny story
involving Cristiano no I have a lot of
memories with him obviously playing
together for 10 years now because that's
when I started with a national team 10
years ago I think one of the first times
when I when I when I joined the National
team some players we were entering the
buzz and some and and I didn't know
where to sit and some of the old guys
said ah you can sit there it's there's a
free a free space and but that was
actually Cristiano's Cristiano's place
in the bus and when Cristiano entered
the bus he just started laughing and he
said you can sit here with me but I was
in his place I was just a kid 19 or 20
years 20 years old the other guys they
they tricked me and they put me in
Cristiano seat so that was quite funny H
I wonder what Cristiano will think of
all of this when he sees it have you had
any funny experiences with Cristiano
that stand out no I'm not I'm not here a
long time uh so uh not yet uh but we'll
see hey guys one thing if you haven't
been here for a long time make sure you
like and
subcribe so you won't miss any videos
what's the memorable moment you remember
with Cristiano it's funny but also
emotional I know the first time I came
to national team I was obviously
surrounded by players amazing players
and uh that I've always looked up to in
the T and obviously I was really shy I
didn't want to speak to anyone I was
giving handshakes looking down and
crisano wasn't there when I arrived
because I arrived really early obviously
first first call and uh all Cristiano
arrives starts like speaking to me says
my name and and it was like oh I'm
watching your games you're scoring goals
really well you're doing really very
well for sporting and everything and I
remember going to the room and speaking
with my friends and family how does he
know I'm I'm speaking why he's watching
my games how how does he even know my
name because it was the first time I was
calling out for national team I know and
you look up to these kind of players and
you always think that they they they
don't know who you are let's get on to
the next what kind of job do you imagine
Cristiano would have if he didn't play
football maybe nutritionist like
nutrition is very he loves these kind of
things he's always talking about these
kind of things things that you have to
eat to perform better how you feel your
health so so I would say maybe that yeah
what do you think Cristiano's job would
be if he hadn't made it as a footballer
at the moment I would say paddle player
CU I think he's really into that so he
could be a paddle player uh if not
nutritionist or a mental coach if
Cristiano wasn't a professional
footballer what career do you think he
would have pursued for sure something
related with nutrition I think the
physiology of the body wow everyone
seems to agree on this one Cristiano
could have been been a nutritionist hey
Cristiano maybe it's time you open the
first Ur
[Music]
restaurant and before we wrap up let's
take a moment to catch up with the man
of the hour himself Cristiano
[Music]
Ronaldo get ready for an unforgettable
night in Lisbon we're at the balm
Cultural Center where the one and only
Christiana Ronaldo is being honored with
the prestigious platinium Ken trophy by
the Portuguese Football
[Music]
Federation well for me is um is amazing
to receive this this uh Award with this
magnitude it's it's wonderful uh my
career is not end yet I still continue
to play to enjoy myself uh many things
to to come but of course I'm I'm very
happy with this this is a very important
awards for Portugal Federation Portugal
national team and for me to receive the
let's say the most important award for
me it's it's it's great and I feel very
honored for that it's always special to
be surround of Young Generation kids
especially from Madera they are from
Madera they have a dream they want to to
reach the best things of their lives the
dream to be a football professional
player
and for me it's amazing when I felt that
the kids they love something I support
them and especially from mad because
this is where I raise and uh I kind feel
emotional when I see kids from Madera

happy for that my message is always kind
of uh the same it's follow your dreams

nobody knows I think probably that
nobody knows they that I love to joke so

everything sometimes I have to be
serious of course my job and but
sometimes in life you have to enjoy
ourself to make fun to enjoy with each
other it's the best way to you know to
have a good life I think we're sure

adamantium I don't know I might have
read that somewhere maybe isn't true

hWtp3ZlvHZc,"when you hop on a boat to move away
1,000 kmet away from your home the real
trip begins when you
[Music]
arrive this is a story of how Cristiano
Ronaldo became a professional football
[Music]
player at the beginning living in the
sporting Portugal Academy known among
the fans as the leaos was really really
hard we were all kids but all of them
were competing for the same goal to
become a professional football
player as it happens always in football
our rivalry was only limited to the
pitch and since all of us were all away
from our families we created our own
there we learned the important stuff
Beyond football like how important
nutrition is to be able to perform at
top level in the training and in the
games grilled fish was our favorite food
but such a fancy dish was not something
we could afford every day
therefore if we wanted to eat well we
needed to earn money in some way we
earned our first income as ball boys
during the matches of sporting Portugal
but beyond money we got the hunger to
play for our team in that Stadium under
the bright lights and among the chant of
all our fans needless to say who
achieved it
first the jump from the academy to the
first team was amazing even the showers
were very fancy it was all these small
things that made us feel very happy and
thankful the other veteran players were
amused by how we were satisfied with so
little of course the big names on the
team were Superstars making big money
and owning amazing car there was a
beautiful sports car it was red with a
black roof beautiful or maybe it was
black with a red
roof those players had so much SU
experience on the pitch but we were able
to beat them on let's say different
games on one of those nights playing
with a veterans Cristiano made one of
his biggest bets yet even though he had
no money to do it so what did he bet
then he puts his future on the table he
decided to bet his first Golden Ball
fortunately he
won we all have dreams but Christiano
was not only dreaming while sleeping to
be honest he barely slept back then at
midnight he was all by himself training
in the gym once the sun was out you
would also not find him sleeping on his
bed day and night night and day fully
focused on one goal to become the best
player ever nobody imagined that was
going to become the reality at least not
as fast as it did but Cristiano had it
all figured out on August 6th 200 three
Cristiano after an amazing off season
managed to be the starter during the
first match in the new Jose albalat
stadium in Lisbon a friendly match
between sporting Portugal and Manchester
United Sir Alex Ferguson had zero doubts
after witnessing Cristiano during this
game and afterwards he placed his own
bet he went all in on getting him
transferred to Manchester
United Cristiano who is a competitive
Beast also up the
