This is not an Indian problem. It is a global problem that should bother each and every one of us. Poverty has no boundaries. Please don’t look the other way anymore. Together we can fix it by supporting incredible groups like Tiljala Shed (https://tished.org/). Sometimes we see a problem that seems so insurmountable that we ignore it thinking “What difference will $5 make?” It makes a huge difference because thousands of small donations add up very fast, but thousands of people deciding their contribution is too small to make a difference leads nowhere. Please give what you can. Apathy is our enemy. Started by Alamgir, and now run by his son Shafkat, Tiljala Shed is an outstanding organization. They are committed to helping as many children as possible by giving them dignity and opportunity. Please consider donating to help. https://tished.org/donate/ International Donors: https://goto.gg/32034 Indian Donors: https://give.do/fundraisers/tiljala-shed-education While we were in India we were told many of the children in the program came from households where there was not enough food to eat every day. Massive shoutout to The Smith Brothers Family Foundation for their incredibly generous donation to feed all these families for the next two years. And finally, in a shocking, yet unsurprising (I know that doesn’t make sense, but its how I feel) act of generosity, Tony and Sage Robbins, after watching a prescreening of the video, instantly offered to support this entire program, including the at-home meals for these kids and their families for an entire additional year. https://www.thetonyrobbinsfoundation.org/ https://www.instagram.com/sagerobbins/ Poverty is a global problem.
