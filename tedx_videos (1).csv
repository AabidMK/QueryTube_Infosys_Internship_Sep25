NYQEeiz-n7I,"The World's First ""Nature Superpower""s | Ilona Szabó de Carvalho | TED","Over the last 40 years, Brazil has lost an area larger than California to deforestation — and 90 percent of the clear-cutting has been illegal, all part of a multi-billion-dollar global environmental crime economy. Civic entrepreneur Ilona Szabó de Carvalho sees this crisis as an opportunity. Revealing how Brazil is pioneering an economic model actually profiting from protecting nature, she shares the ambitious restoration goals and innovations in forest mapping that are turning the country into a ""nature superpower."" Get a glimpse of what an economy rooted in regeneration, not extraction, could look like. (Recorded at TED Countdown Summit 2025 on June 16, 2025)

BzUb5MOysLo,How Displaced People Are Driving Local Economies | Julienne Oyler | TED,"The number of forcibly displaced people across the world is on the rise. While aid systems often focus on providing basic necessities like food and shelter, Julienne Oyler and her team at the nonprofit Inkomoko have a more ambitious plan: invest in refugee entrepreneurs in order to help them build their businesses, uplift their communities and gain access to financial services. She describes how displaced people are already driving local economies — and shows what it will take to bring their innovations to scale. (This ambitious idea is part of The Audacious Project, TED’s initiative to inspire and fund global change.) (Recorded at TED2025 on April 9, 2025)

GZKU7TgR6IU,How Common Knowledge Shapes the World | Steven Pinker | TED,"Common knowledge is the secret engine of social life, letting us coordinate everything from meet-ups to markets to international diplomacy. In this fascinating talk, experimental cognitive scientist Steven Pinker explores its momentous impact, threading together stories of why autocrats fear blank signs, why central bankers mumble and why saying the quiet part out loud can wreck a friendship. With wit and wisdom, he invites us to better understand the ways we get into each other’s heads — and what it means when shared norms wobble. (Recorded at TED2025 on April 8, 2025)

Lines like these are representative of a more serious issue, Cary says: the lack of diversity in design that leads to thoughtless, compassionless spaces. Design has a unique ability to dignify and make people feel valued, respected, honored and seen -- but the flip side is also true. Cary calls for architects and designers to expand their ranks and commit to serving the public good, not just the privileged few. ""Well-designed spaces are not just a matter of taste or a questions of aesthetics,"" he says. ""They literally shape our ideas about who we are in the world and what we deserve.""

oTY_r-N49DA,Why We Need to Rethink Fashion (w/ Diarra Bousso) | How to Be a Better Human | TED,"We often think donating clothes is a sustainable act, but when tons of garments are shipped to places like West Africa, it creates environmental waste and disrupts local artisans’ livelihoods. Diarra Bousso, a mathematician and sustainable fashion designer, joins host Chris Duffy to unpack the hidden cost of global textiles waste and how she founded her lifestyle brand, Diarrablu. She shares how she designs with emotional sustainability in mind — creating clothes that adjust to our changing body while showcasing Sengalese’s bold colors and prints. They also discuss how mathematical concepts influence her work, how technology and AI might help designers reduce waste and why it’s important to make clothes that make you feel good.

Looking back, McArdle reframes today’s fears with a poignant question: If we halt progress to protect the present, what might we be stealing from the future? (Recorded at TED2025 on April 9, 2025)

UbzsTXDvhAQ,When Is It OK to Be Wrong? (w/ Tenelle Porter) | How to Be a Better Human | TED,"Tenelle Porter’s job is to study humility. Specifically the intellectual kind -- the idea that we might be wrong or mistaken about some of our beliefs. Tenelle talks with How to Be a Better Human host Chris Duffy about why she thinks intellectual humility is so important, how to cultivate it, and why it’s the missing piece in so many conversations these days. Whether it’s in politics, academia or social media, Tenelle argues discovering you are wrong doesn’t have to be a painful realization; rather it can lead to positive discovery.  

This is an episode of TED's How to Be a Better Human podcast. Listen on your favorite podcast app: https://tedtalks.social/4gmAZt3
