And in this video I'm going to break down some of the most interesting results.

Check out the full Python Developers Survey Results here: https://jb.gg/python-survey-results-2025

In the last 5 years, I have had the privilege of working at Google, Amazon, and Media.net, and today I am building takeUforward, the world’s first ONE STOP preparation platform. Our dream is simple: to create a world-class product from India at an affordable cost, while also ensuring that free learning at TUF is among the best out there.  Back in college, I was a CM on Codeforces and a 6★ on CodeChef. But honestly, more than ratings, what excites me is teaching the way I wish I had been taught. I may not be the best coder in the country, but when it comes to explaining concepts deeply, clearly, and at scale, I would like to believe this channel speaks for itself.  Here, you will not just find algorithms, you will find the entire thought process behind problem solving, taught in structured, in-depth, English lectures with enough practice and volume to prepare you for real interviews.  📩 hello@takeuforward.org ",IN,https://yt3.ggpht.com/dSkEwiYrGlZPE6t9irfN8RlpDlaU_n7u3oEnHxJIY_knycUXPzEVlFKbYtwzkcysNDVZPn5zmHg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,927000,536,l4 print all prime factors of a number maths playlist,check out tuf https takeuforward org plus source youtube find dsa lld oops core subjects 1000 premium questions company wise aptitude sql ai doubt support and many other features that will help you to stay focussed inside one platform under one affordable subscription have a hassle free one stop solution for up skilling and preparing also our other social s https linktr ee takeuforward check out takeuforward website for the sheet and other free resources takeuforward org join our discord channel https discord gg ggyqagedbg,1133,print all prime factors of a number|print all prime factors a given number in java|maths playlist|maths playlist for interviews|maths playlist for competitive programming|advanced maths|dsa in c++|dsa playlist|striver|takeuforward
251,yguDjZcUpH8,Lone Wolf Dev turned Open Source Super Contributor Tom Mondloch [Podcast #190],"Tom Mondloch quit programming after he finished community college. After a few years of odd jobs, he decided to get back into programming and discovered freeCodeCamp. 

He was just learning his own way, and didn't think freeCodeCamp's linear curriculum would be worth his time. But he stuck with it, got good, and ultimately started contributing to our open source project.

He's since joined freeCodeCamp's staff and archetected freeCodeCamp's entire relational database curriculum, which you can run in your browser or right inside your VS Code editor.

Tom shares tips for:
- Brushing up on your programming skills if you've taken a few years off
- Contributing to open source
- Using AI codegen tools sensibly and not relying too heavily on them

He also talks about the role of vocational college, his love of the outdoors, and how working remotely allows him to continue to live in small town middle America without the need to move to a big city.

News items:

1. freeCodeCamp just published this comprehensive front end development course where you build your own browser-based code editor. You can code along at home and build your own single page app development environment with tabs for editing your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Along the way, you'll learn some intermediate JS techniques that allow for instant live preview, so you can see the results of your code changes right away. (4 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/code-your-own-code-editor/

2. I also made a quick announcement about some big improvements to our core Full Stack Development curriculum. In short, we're breaking down our new coursework into a series of six new certifications you can earn along the way to the capstone cert. These include Python, Relational Databases, Front End Libraries, and more. (5 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/introducing-freecodecamp-checkpoint-certifications/

3. freeCodeCamp also just published this new course that will help you pass the Databricks Data Engineer Associate certification exam. Andrew Brown is a CTO who has passed practically every DevOps exam under the sun, and he teaches this course. He'll introduce you to key concepts like Clusters, Structured Streaming, Data Lakes, and more. (8 hour course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/prepare-for-the-databricks-data-engineer-associate-certification-exam-and-pass/

5. Enjoy this breezy read about Cosine Similarity and the role it plays in Large Language Models. As its author, Manish, says, Cosine Similarity is “a bridge between human language and machine understanding. It allows a model to treat meaning as geometry, turning questions and answers into points in space.” Not only will you learn the math involved, you'll also see it implemented in Python code.

262,MiGXhDvuvEg,Learn Chess and Become a Better Developer with Ihechikara Abba (ELO rating of 2285) [Podcast #189],"On this week's freeCodeCamp podcast we're talking with software engineer Ihechikara Abba, who has a chess ELO rating of 2285, putting him among top competitive chess players. We just published his freeCodeCamp course on chess end games, and an accompanying handbook. 

We talk about:
how learning chess can make you a better developer
tips for getting into embedded systems development with Arduino
how contributing to open source can serve as an alternative to building up a social media presence

Links from our discussion:

Ihechikara's checkmate patterns handbook: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/checkmate-patterns-in-chess-for-beginners/

Ihechikara's Arduino embedded systems handbook: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-arduino-handbook/

Links from community news segment at the beginning: 

1. freeCodeCamp just published a GameDev for beginners course that will help you build your first 2D platformer game. First you'll learn the basics of the open source Godot game engine, and its Python-like GDScript programming language. Then you'll dive into Godot's editor, custom tile sets, game mechanics, scoring, checkpoint systems, and more. By the end of the course, you'll have your own game that your friends can play in any browser. (1 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-game-development-by-building-your-first-platformer-with-godot/

2. freeCodeCamp just launched our daily coding challenges. You can solve these programming puzzles using Python or JavaScript. Build up your data structures + algorithms skills each day, right in your browser or in the freeCodeCamp iPhone or Android app. We're launching with a backlog of 30 challenges that are live now. See how many you can solve. (article with more details): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/introducing-freecodecamp-daily-python-and-javascript-challenges-solve-a-new-programming-puzzle-every-day/

3. Learn how to build your own secure PHP web apps using the popular open source Symfony framework. This intermediate course is taught by Beau Carnes, who has many years of experience as a software engineer and as a high school special ed teacher. He'll quickly fill you in on Symfony's security features, which enable you to query encrypted data without ever even needing to decrypt it on your MongoDB database server. You can code along and home and build your own secure personal finance app while applying these new concepts. (1 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-secure-web-applications-with-php-symfony-and-mongodb/

4. I also recommend reading this quick post by a freeCodeCamp community member on the importance of Hackathons. They opened all sorts of doors for him in his job search. (10 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/why-every-student-should-join-hackathons/

I also recommend you watch this video essay on Janet Jackson's ""Rhythm Nation"" explaining the physics behind why the song breaks some laptop hard drives when played: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y3RGeaxksY

And the song of the week is 1989's Rhythm Nation by a then 23-year-old Janet Jackson. The song's great but you really want to watch the video version, with its awesome dance choreography. I've linked to it in the description. Listen to it after the podcast. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAwaNWGLM0c

CORRECTION: I (Quincy) say during the interview that the Uber found a way to access microphones on iOS without users' knowledge. There have been documented cases of malware doing this (like Pegasus) but Uber didn't do this. They did do a lot of other shady things, like continue collecting data even after you deleted their app – but mic spying was not one of them. Yes, early Uber was an ethical tire fire. But it's important to get facts right here.

- Why you should still learn CSS in 2025

299,5MoZ1hJuvqM,Automating a coffee shop chain using self-taught coding skills with Eamonn Cottrell [Interview #151],"On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews Eamonn Cottrell. He's a software engineer who also runs a local chain of coffee shops in Knoxville. Eamonn taught himself to code using freeCodeCamp. And he's since published 37 freeCodeCamp tutorials on  productivity and automation using spreadsheets.

Support for this podcast comes from a grant from Wix Studio. Wix Studio provides developers tools to rapidly build websites with everything out-of-the-box, then extend, replace, and break boundaries with code. Learn more at https://wixstudio.com

Support also comes from the 11,113 kind folks who support freeCodeCamp through a monthly donation. Join these kind folks and get involved in our mission by going to donate.freecodecamp.org

We talk about:
- Eamonn's love of coffee and how he bought VHS tapes to learn latte art
- How he finds time to expand his skills in between running coffee shops and ultra-marathoning
- How he used spreadsheets to automate the logistics of running coffee shops
- How he balances being a musician and writer with the practical realities of providing for a family of 6

CORRECTION: Vincent van Gogh was supported by his younger brother – not his brother in-law. van Gogh never married so he never had a brother in law. I'm not sure why I thought that. Also, he seems to have sold more than one painting in his life (as many of us were taught in school), but nowhere near enough paintings to support himself as an artist.

Can you guess what song I'm playing in the intro?

On January 1st, 2014, I uploaded the first ""Things You Might Not Know"" video. Once the initial rush of videos settled down, I aimed for one video a week, and while there have sometimes been guest videos and occasional blatant filler: to my own satisfaction, I never missed a week. But now, it's time to stop.

I never got to space. I never got to the ocean depths. And I never got to fly off into the sunset, harnessed underneath a helicopter. I couldn't find an excuse for that one.

318,Oarf76MCrss,Grizzly bear GoPro selfie: raw unedited footage,"This footage is public domain, and the raw files are available at  https://archive.org/details/grizzly-bear-selfie ■ An explanation, which is not public domain: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq4ZkfojSis ■ Two videos taken by grizzly bears at the Grizzy & Wolf Discovery Center, West Yellowstone, Montana. The bears found a previously-lost GoPro Hero 11 in a protective case, in their pond, which had enough battery left to take a couple of brief shots, including a selfie.

As these video files were created entirely by bears, by accident, I believe them to be in the public domain. If that's not the case, then as the owner of the camera and potential copyright holder, I'm happy to license these files under CC0 and dedicate them to the public domain as far as legally possible.

However, if I don't upload them to YouTube first, then someone else will — and YouTube's copyright systems often get confused by public domain footage, so for my own safety, this is the digital equivalent of sending them to myself in a sealed, postmarked envelope.

YouTube's system the license for this listed as ""Creative Commons - Attribution"", because ""Public Domain"" is not an option. You are not required to attribute this footage, but if you do use these files, it'd be nice to make a donation to the Grizzly & Wolf Discovery Center. They've got bears to feed. https://www.grizzlydiscoveryctr.org/

327,1v8u3ua6BPk,The people who get paid to get sick,"I went inside the former hotel where, for science (and money), people are volunteering to get colds, flu, and RSV. ■ Challenge trials looking for volunteers: https://flucamp.com/ and https://www.1daysooner.org/recruiting-challenge-studies

This isn't an advert! the subject was suggested by the team at 1DaySooner, but that's it: no money changed hands and no editorial control was given away.

Two bonus facts I couldn't fit in the main video:
😷 There are some challenge trials which require stronger quarantine protocols or negative-pressure rooms, but they're much more rare (and much more difficult to film)
🧻 The tissues that volunteers sneeze into have to be put into a separate bag, so they can be weighed

330,KRIBVykhpC4,"It's the Matrix, but for locusts.","At the Department of Collective Behaviour, part of the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior, researchers are putting locusts into simulated worlds, both virtual and physical, in the hope that they can figure out how devastating swarms form and move. ■ About the Centre: https://www.exc.uni-konstanz.de/collective-behaviour/ https://www.ab.mpg.de/couzin

Edited by Michelle Martin https://www.youtube.com/@OnTheCrux
Thanks to David Walter for the suggestion

This is the most uncomfortable I've ever felt while filming, for a few reasons. First, of course, because of the locust swarm itself. Second, because animal research — even on creatures as simple and pestilent as locusts — always raises ethical questions. Now, the researchers are careful with the locusts, and I don't think many people could have a problem with this. Indeed, most of the world currently has zero ethical restrictions on insect experimentation — but it's still worth interrogating whether this is okay. And finally: because if we can do this so easily to less intelligent creatures... what's to stop something more intelligent coming along and doing the same to us?

I'm a bit worried that this comes across as an advert. It's not — I reached out to the team at GIKEN, they had no editorial control, and no money changed hands. (Although they did, of course, go through all the paperwork required to let me climb into their giant robot parking garage.) They also asked me to include this: “Eco Cycle and Eco Park are brand names of GIKEN LTD. in Japan”, which seemed a reasonable enough request.
