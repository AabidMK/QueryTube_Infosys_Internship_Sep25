YoMpFmLt8f0,"We're going to make the world's easiest mac and cheese recipe. Bring 1 and 1/2 cups of whole milk and 1 cup of water to a boil, adding 8 oz of elbow flavored macaroni. Once the macaroni is just shy of fully cooked, we're going to add 4 oz of shredded yellow American cheese. Once the American is fully melted, we're killing the heat, adding 4 oz of shredded cheddar, covering and letting sit for 5 minutes so the cheddar can more gently melt without breaking. Once 5 minutes is up, give it a stir. Add some more cheddar if it's a little bit too liquidy. Season with salt to taste. And then we need to nail the game's form factor, a domed orange yellow blob. So, we're going to place the mac and cheese in a stainless steel bowl lined with plastic wrap. Let it set at room temperature for about an hour. Dump it out onto a plate. Give it a little shimmy to set it free. Remove the plastic wrap. And there you have it, the Sims mac and cheese. All it needs is a garnish of fresh parsley.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
XpL2ZyyF55U,"Mac and cheese. One of the most essential of food products. It ranges from impossibly simple to impossibly complex. Where on that spectrum do you want to land? I'll show you the way. All you have to do is hold both my hands, give me some, and we'll make some pasta with cheese on it. [Music] Hey, what's up guys and welcome back to Babish. Today we're taking a look at 10 levels of mac and cheese. Starting with the very easiest. It's even right there in the name. Uh, wow. They rebranded it. It's not easy mac anymore. Now it's just called craft mac and cheese in a cup that you microwave, but it is the easiest iteration of mac that I can imagine. Step one, remove lid and cheese sauce pouch. Step two, add water to the fill line in cup. Stir. Step three, microwave on high 3 and 1/2 minutes. Step four, stir in cheese sauce. And that's the long and short of it. Doesn't say to eat it, but I trust that that's step five. I remember this being indistinguishable from the box stuff. Why is this so awful? It's so gluey. I put in exactly the right amount of water. I cooked it for this right amount of time. I'll add some water to thin it out. Just give it the benefit of the doubt. So, Easy Mac, well, Craft Mac and Cheese Microwave Edition. Let's see if it's gross. It's um not terribly good. We have uh some really overcooked noodles, some very undercooked noodles. Then the sauce turned out really gloopy and gelatinous because of the starches that they add to the bowl to help the sauce emulsify without milk. It scratches the Mac itch if you're a child or a college student. It's also a form of child, what I would call borderline acceptable. But then there's level two, boxed mac. Not so easy. Still very easy. Requires cooking utensils and a stove. [Music] Step one, boil water in medium saucepan. Stir in macaroni. Cook 7 to 8 minutes or until tender. Drain. Do not rinse. Return to pan. Add margarine or butter. Milk and cheese sauce. Blue box. As essential a mac and cheese as there is, but let's see if it's worth all that extra effort. It remains as good to this day as it ever was. So yeah, it's lost a lot of that artificial flavor that I really love. Never mind. They changed the recipe and it sucks now. It's too light in color. It should be electric orange and it should taste like chemicals masquerading as cheese. Now it just tastes like level two. disappointing for unforeseen reasons, but also Blue Box. Can't hate Blue Box. I dare you. Level three, Blue Box dressed up for the first date it's gone on in years. So, it's pulling out the pattern tie, the suspenders, the dress watch, and it's showing off its tattoos by rolling up the French cuffs. It's trying way too hard, but it's still delicious if you just give it a try. So, to elevate our blue box, first we're going to make twice as much. That's an upgrade already. Oops. Whoops. It's one of the dumbest things I've ever done. That was But instead of adding our butter and milk straight to the pan, we're going to heat them up in a separate little saucepan and we're going to infuse them with spices. Paprika, dried garlic, and ground mustard. Get that nice and melty. Get the pasta cooked. Bring it all together. and then pour it into a buttered cast iron casserole. And we're not stopping there. We're going to butter up some crushed corn flakes and sprinkle those over top. Then we're going to bake it at 375 Fahrenheit for about 2530 minutes. All right, level three, dressed up craft. Craft's all dressed up for dinner. Man, it tastes homemade. And in the end, all we did was add spices and corn flakes. Pretty fantastic result. This is way better. and very easy upgrade to craft mac and cheese is to treat it like real mac and cheese, which it is. You know what I mean? Level four. And now we're delving into food hacks. Mixing three very simple ingredients together. Will they become something greater than the sum of their parts? I'll let the other me find out. We're going to make a simple cheese sauce out of evaporated milk. This is milk that has much higher protein content than normal milk, which helps something happen. And we're going to use shredded cheese coated in cornstarch. Now, you can do this yourself. Shred some cheese, coat it with cornstarch. But to make it super duper easy, we're going to use pre-shredded cheese, something I normally never advise using because it is coated in starch for the very reason that we seek it out today. Now, you need to read the back of the bag because I found, oddly enough, that there's an inverse relationship to price and quality. I have here three examples from across the price and quality spectrum. Most expensive, of course, is organic valley. This is $2 more expensive than these guys, and you're getting 2 ounces less. That and it is coated not with starch, but cellulose. Cellulose is wood pulp. I'm not joking. It's wood pulp. Cellulose does not bind proteins together and it will give you a gritty, clumpy sauce. So, what you want to look for are plant-based starches. Tapioca starch, potato starch, cornstarch. Craft mac and cheese, which is oddly the middle of the pack for price, uses only corn starch, which is great. Cabbitt, which was shockingly cheaper and one of my favorite cheese brands because they're all lactosefree, uses potato starch and tapioca starch, both also great candidates. So, all we have to do then is heat up some evaporated milk. Gently stirring the cheese and rake in the money. So, I'm going to pour 12 oz of evaporated milk into a saucepan. I'm going to heat it gently over medium medium low heat. Add my shredded starchcoated cheese. 12 oz worth. And we're going to gently whisk the cheese in with the evaporated milk while heating over low heat until melted and smooth. Oh my god, it's working. I mean, I don't want to speak too soon, but what we have done is changed the game forever. I'm so blown away. Pour in our super easy cheese sauce, and we're going to add a little bit of pasta cooking water, starting with 1/4 cup, and adjusting as necessary. Oh, mommy. Wow, dude. me. Perfect. I don't believe it. Level four. And holy. Right. Just kind of made this one up on the spot here. And it appears to have worked, I would say, to a ridiculously well extent. Good extent. I would say it's worked very well. Look at how freaking gooey it is. It's so perfectly smooth and gooey. Just those two things. This is what Stoers is trying to be. It's what keeps it up at night. Sweating, tossing, turning. It's like, why can't I be like this? Oh my god, that was the easiest cheese sauce I've ever made. And it is perfectly smooth and creamy and gooey. I think we've just changed the entire world. I think wars will no longer have to be fought that might have been fought otherwise. I think that next up, cure for cancer. I'm allowed to say that cuz my mom died of cancer. Level five, one of my favorite recipes from America's Test Kitchen. This is a one pot macaroni and cheese that really works. And it does that by using the stabilizers in American cheese. I'm going to shred this guy. And we're also going to grate 4 oz of sharp cheddar. This is going to be our source of flavor. Uh, and it's going to integrate seamlessly into the cheese sauce by virtue of the shredded yellow American. Please be careful. It's making me nervous. That's fine, Brad. This is my craft. My craft cheese. We'll be right back. Does the size of a sauté pan matter? Yeah, different recipes require differentiz pans, and this one offers great utility in the 12 in range. So, yeah. No, the size of this sauté pen matters. Absolutely. Can a small pan still work in some applications though? Yeah. Um, a small pan can work in some applica. I don't really understand your line of questioning and why you're giggling while you're asking me. It's a little offputting. All right, let's head over to the stove top where other things are going to happen. In a medium saucepan, I'm combining 1 and 1/2 cups of whole milk with 1 cup of whole water. Cover and bring it to a rolling simmer. Then we're going to add 8 ounces of elbow macaroni. And we're going to cook this until it's cooked and most of the milk water mixture has been absorbed. You're going to want to stir this pasta more frequently than others because cooking it in the milk causes it to stick to itself like a young man discovering his, you know. Then we're going to kill the heat and add our American and cheddar cheese mixture. Damp up the flavor a little bit. I've got a/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper and about a/ teaspoon of Dijon mustard. Always welcome ingredients for any mac and cheese that needs a big hit of flavor. Now that our cheese sauce is nice and gooey, we're going to add a melty factor by stirring in the rest of our shredded cheddar, mixing until just combined throughout the pasta, covering and allowing to melt. If you want to be really, really fancy, hit it with a little bit of freshly ground black pepper. And there you have it. Level five, the first truly from scratch mac and cheese. Really beautiful, creamy, smooth sauce. That's a good sign. Somehow it's smoother than the evaporated milk sauce. At least the extra effort rewards you with something because I was going to just forever abandon this method for the for the uh evaporated milk one, but it's just so smooth and creamy. The one thing I will say is that the sauce is not nearly as flavorful because it's half American cheese, which does not have much flavor to it. So, it's always going to be a little blander than the evaporated milk sauce, and it relies on mustard to bring more cheesy flavor, but really, it just kind of tastes like mustard. So, it's a wonderful, fantastic option for quick and easy homemade mac and cheese. But, if I had to pick one, I'd go evaporated milk. I'd go level four over level five. And that is weird, right? Look, we already did baked mac and cheese. Wouldn't you rather see me take that mac and cheese bread and deep fry it, skewer it into a tall, erect tower served in a shallow pool of ranch. That's what I thought. I didn't hear your answer, but I assumed it. And that's what real men do. And there you have it. Level six mac and cheese. extra cheese. Breaded, deep fried, and served in a shallow pool of ranch. Let's see how it is, though. That works. The mac and cheese and ranch. Weird. It works. So, obviously, this is both easy and heart healthy, but it did spark a debate here in the office. Is this a preparation of mac and cheese, or is this something to do with mac and cheese? And um I'm here to settle it. Uh this is a a thing to do with mac and cheese. And while this of course is Texas state fair food, it I mean like Texas state fair food is delicious. It's it's it's horrible and it's delicious. Almost forgot in the traditional preparation. Of course, it is slathered with cats up. There we go. Now it's a feast fit for a kingsized scooter. Level seven, the mouret level, where we're actually making a sauce using rue and mouret and uh bashamel and milk and um French other French words. There's there's a lot of whisking. There's carefulness being exercised and it's really great. So, let's talk cheese. I'm going with 12 oz of different cheeses. Some bringing meltiness and richness, others bringing tang, sharpness. We have different ages, different colors, different countries of origin. And it all comes together in the grand melting pot of mac and cheese melting pot. I have mostly a mild yellow cheddar. This is an excellent melter. It's going to help prevent the sauce from getting gritty. What makes sauce gritty is more aged cheeses. I have here some kha which is how you're actually supposed to pronounce gura but I know that I'm never going to get away with that the same way I would quas you know just be like and now I've got some kha here everybody's going to be like the did he just say to me in my Christian house in front of my Christian daughter and then for tons of flavor but high potential of grittiness so we're not using much of it parmesan or reana all these need to be fresh grated and the parmesan in particular cuz I want it to melt quickly I'm going to grate finally ly. Look at that beautiful mix and spread of cheese. Bear in mind, much in the way the parmesan is now coating the strands of cheese, you could absolutely coat this in cornstarch, tapioca starch, potato starch, and simply melt it in evaporated milk. You'd have an cheese sauce that's way easier and I think a better texture than the one we're about to make. We'll be right back after I consider what I'm doing here. So, in a medium highwalled sauté pan, I'm melting 2 tablespoons of butter, adding an equal part of flour, whisking to combine into a paste, which we're then going to cook for 1 to 3 minutes, just until the raw flour smell dissipates. Now, we've got two cups, that's 1 tbsp, butter and flour per cup of whole milk, which maddeningly, we're going to stir in one little splash at a time. And when we do, things are going to clump up in rather a frightening and unsavory way. But worry not, because I know what I'm doing. If you just add it all at once, it'll clump like this and not and it'll just be this inside of your sauce. But if we make sure that each splash of milk is fully incorporated into the clumps, eventually it's going to smooth out. Now, at a certain point, you're just going to have a very thick bashamel. And that's the point when you can start adding more milk at a time. It's pretty much where we're at now. And there you have it, a beautifully smooth bashamel. Now, we're going to slowly bring this beshmal up to a very gentle simmer. Then, once we've cooked it for about 3 minutes, we're going to kill the heat, stir in our cheeses, and let the residual heat melt the cheese into a smooth mouret sauce. What is moure? Well, metaphorically, it's an awakening from sleep into dream. What? Right. Well, that's got to be the best ma I've ever made. Oo, the original mac and cheese. Much trickier, but lots more opportunities to build flavor with different kinds of cheeses. Something about a mouret sauce, you kind of can't beat it. Like those other sauces were creamier and smoother because they were made from processed cheese or they were made with starch, which makes things taste processed. Tastes like a or has the the mouth feel of a packet cheese, you know. And this just feels like a classic mac and cheese sauce. Yes, it's not as smooth, but it's flawed in just the right ways to make it flawless. Being able to build a bashimal and a mouret sauce are really great skills to have in your tool skill set box pocket and definitely worth doing the next time you're trying to impress your boss or something. What do you say to people who say molecular gastronomy? What is that? To those of you who don't know what molecular gastronomy is, it's the practice of spending lots of money to create balls and foams that I would say detract from eating experiences more than they add to them. Why do people do that? Nobody knows. And that's why you pay so darn much for it. But we're doing something different. We're only doing something that is technically molecular gastronomy. We're using sodium citrate. Wait, so what is molecular gastronomy? Technically, I have noing idea. So sodium citrate is an athome equivalent to the stabilizer that they use in American cheese. It's basically how uh and why American cheese is such a great melter. So now we can do the same with not so great melting cheeses. That's what we're going to do. First, we got to grate our cheese. Do not use pre-shredded cheese for this joint or I'll kill you. Just kidding. And then I'm just going to heat up one cup of milk. Meanwhile, over here, we're going to ready our blender. Into the blender, I'm going to measure about 12 oz of cheese. And I'm going to add about a/ teaspoon dijon mustard. And for a big old bite of flavor, some finely grated Pecarino Romano cheese. And let's also throw a little bit of cayenne pepper in there just to show that we care. And as soon as our milk is boiling, we're going to build our sauce. Uh, milk's boiling. So, I'm going to add this/ teaspoon of sodium citrate directly to the milk. We're going to give that a little tiny whisking just to make sure the sodium citrate's dissolved. Then, the blender awaits it. Start on relatively low speed. and that both should and has actually yielded an incredibly gooey cheese sauce. Okay, Kavatapi with an absolutely foolproof so foolproof it couldn't even didn't make a fool of me cheese sauce. I mean, it's so so easy. Um, it is next level creamy. It's etheral. It's bizarre. It's honestly not my favorite. I I doing this made me realize that I think I like moure sauce the most. But your ability to use any cheese and just bang it hard fast and just do it instantly in a blender, it's it's it's it's pretty incredible. It's pretty wild and it's absolutely worth picking up a a bag of sodium citrate and keeping it under your bed next to the Playboy magazines just in case you need some cheese sauce. So, that's level eight. After the break, we're going to see what happens when we add a special secret ingredient. Lots and lots of money. [Music] Level 9 is where we see what happens when we put a whole lot of money where our mouth is. And where our mouth is is on this mac and cheese. So, we're going to put some money into it. Do you see what I did there? No. It's rare that you put your money where your mouth is in the context of food. And frankly, that was extremely clever. And I came up with it on the fly. And I think we should just all recognize that. Yeah. If we all recognize that recognition. Perfect. We're seeing what happens when we use only the most expensive ingredients. So for the cheese, not only did Rachel go to Italy and get the most expensive cheese at Italy, which is saying something. This one was $60.99 a pound. This one was $36.99 a pound. And then we got the four most expensive cheeses from my local grocery shop. Each of which was 27.99 a pound. So by putting a pound's worth of cheese in this cheese sauce, we're looking at, you know, about a 30 $35 cheese sauce basically depending on how much we use of each. And that's just the cheese sauce. I'm just getting started. Babish Nation. Next up, the pasta. And I love busiate. This guy was 12 bucks for this bag. And uh that's a lot. It's going to be these long curls. These guys are probably going to unfurl into these long curls, which are annoying to eat, which usually expensive pasta bullseye. We have Senica milk clocking in at some dollars and some cents. This is the most expensive milk we could find. Just trust us. I have one summer burgundy truffle clocking in at $40 for this little guy. We have a lovely lobster tail whose price cannot be calculated. It's It's priceless. And then we have this little whack of butter. This little guy, this little piece of Italian butter was like $12. Will these make a difference? These questions and more answered right now. Now, the lobster tail I'm going to cut open, pull out the meat, and gently butter poach it before adding it to the mac and cheese. How do you respond to those who say adding lobster is cheating? Has anybody ever said that? I mean, this person I just made up for the sake of this question did. Well, I would say to that person, cheating in the game of what? Mac and cheese. It's a good answer. Cheating in the game of mac and cheese. What? That's a great answer on your part. Gotcha. Touche. I'm going to grate up this cheese. Now, to build the cheese sauce, instead of using plain old butter, I'm using this expensive butter that was used to poach lobster. So, that you can I do I have to explain myself? That's a brilliant idea. I'm going to do tablespoon and a half of this butter. Add one tablespoon of flour. Uh this is very very little amounts of rue, but I'm going to be using both sodium citrate and rue to ensure stabilization, but also a nice classic mac and cheese texture. Now, I'm going to stream in our very expensive milk, one little splash at a time, whisking until fully incorporated before adding the next. Remember how we talked about this? You always forget. All right, here it is. Now I've added the lobster, the cheese sauce to sort of heat back through cuz it cooled off. And once this pasta is done, we're in the money because this was expensive. There you have it. Very expensive mac and cheese. I'm going to garnish with some finely minced chives because this is looking pretty pale. Some freshly cracked black pepper. And of course, it's just not expensive unless it's completely drowned in freshly shaved black truffle. Okay, there it is. The most expensive mac and cheese ever conceived. It cost about $60 to make it. Imagine what they would charge you in a restaurant. Let's see if it's worth making. Well, the cheese sauce is delicious and it is drowning out the truffle and the lobster. Can't really taste them. This is such a powerful, sharp, funky sauce. That's fantastic, but it overpowered everything else in the orchestra. It just goes to show you can't throw money at problems. You can, but there are diminishing returns. So, throwing money at the problem didn't solve it. Can we make technique the star of the show? on to level 10. One that I'm not actually entirely sure what it is yet because at the time of this recording, I haven't filmed it. Whatever it is, level 10 better be really, really good. It's level 10. So, for this round, I want to try making pasta. Now, normally homemade pasta plus mac and cheese equals no. No. Homemade pasta tends to collapse under the weight of any significant sauce. So, a thick gloopy cheese sauce is for sure just going to take any macaroni we make and sandwich them, pancake them into nothingness. So, I want to try and invent a new kind of pasta. Is that is that such a big deal? What I'm going to do is I'm going to try to make a hybrid between traditional Italian pasta dough and tukbi. Uh, I love tukboki and cheese. The, you know, microwave one, the the easy quick ready snack version. It's one of my favorite expressions of mac and cheese. So, can I make macaroni that has some of the same chewy bouncy characteristics of tukboki? So to make our macaroni tukboki or macbo macboki, I'm basically just going to incorporate a couple techi techniques into traditional pasta making. So first I'm going to effectively make a tangzong out of rice flour. Basically I'm going to pre-hydrate and pre- gelatinize a little bit of rice flour to add some resilience and extra chew to the final product. So, I've got 30 g of rice flour here over which I'm going to pour 90 g of boiling water. Mix to combine. This should form a thick gloopy paste. And then we're going to let it cool completely before trying to work it into the dough. So, now for the primary pasta dough. I've got 300 g of semolina flour combined with 90 g of white rice flour, 60 g of tapioca starch, and 5 g of kosher salt. Give that a tidy little whisking to make sure that everything is homogeneous. Now I'm going to add this cooled rice flour paste. And I'm actually going to press it through a fine mesh sie to make sure that I don't have any lumps. Then I've got 10 g of neutral oil. This is just vegetable oil. And two eggs plus one egg yolk. 120 g of egg all told. Beat that up. Add it to the bowl. Then I'm going to affix my dough hook. And I'm just going to let this knead for a few minutes until everything is evenly mixed. Then I'm going to let it rest for about 20 minutes to make sure that all the starches and flowers are hydrated so I have an accurate picture of what kind of consistency I'm working with here. It's looking pretty dry and crumbly. I'm just going to incorporate things by hand. I have a feeling that once that hydrates, it's going to be the right consistency. What I'm going to do is I'm going to wrap this guy up tightly in plastic wrap. Let them sit at room temperature for about 20 minutes until everything is fully hydrated. All right, so it's been about 20 minutes and I think this is good to go. Like it's fully hydrated. It feels nice and firm, but not sticky, but not crumbly either. Let's give it a try. All right, so I have the small macaroni attachment set up here. So what you want to do here is grab little hunks of dough and form them into balls, which we're going to feed through the extruder, hopefully creating perfect MacBookie on our very first try. That's how life works, right? [Music] Okay, those are macaroni. Last time I checked, we're making macaroni. I know I shouldn't be so surprised, but one of my ideas works, but whatever. I'm not that smart. Holy cats and dogs. It's macaroni. Holy macaroni is what what I meant to say. And there we have it, folks. Some maci. So, I'm very curious to see how this turns out. I'm not going to commit to it until I've tried some. So, let's do that. Water's boiling. I'm going to start with 2 minutes. See where we end up. Now, conventional wisdom says soon as they float, they're done. But, I'm going to go ahead and not do that cuz they're already floating. Okay, that's 2 minutes. I'm going to drain, toss it with a little bit of butter and pasta water. See what we end up with. Okay, that's looking creamy and right. I want to see what kind of strength we're dealing with here. Really nice. It's not collapsing at all underweight. That's great. Uh oh. It's not al dente. And that al dente is kind of like a soft exterior and a chewy almost firm interior. This is just firm throughout. It's delicious. So, I set out to invent a new kind of pasta and I did it on my first try. This is a very first in my life ever occurrence kind of thing. I know pride is a sin, but I think we have our level 10 mac and cheese mac. Now we just got to figure out the cheese. So to start things off, I'm going to make some parmesan broth. Combining two cups of chicken stock with an equal part of water. Then I'm adding some usual stock suspects. We have a big bundle of thyme, couple bay leaves, shallots, a couple cloves of garlic, but then rather unusually, we are adding parmesan cheese rind, as many as we can muster. That's going to simmer for probably about an hour. And I'm going to use this as the cooking liquid for my pasta. And I'm going to insert a little bit of it into the sauce itself. So, obviously, one of the things that steps up mac and cheese is crunch. And I want to bring crunch in two ways. is in the form of cheese, in the form of bread. So, I want to do some homemade breadrumbs, but not any homemade breadrumbs. What I want to do is tear some big sort of like webbby breadcrumbs from a good baguette. So, I'm going to hack off that much. Cut it in half. Okay, look at that. That's exactly what I'm looking for. I want to get this like big kind of webbby structure. This is what I imagine being on top of the mac and cheese. just these big kind of honeycombed bits of fried bread. So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to tear these out. Then, I'm going to generously coat them in olive oil. And then, I'm going to convection bake them to try and get them nice and evenly golden brown all over. Don't worry, this is not going to waste. So, I have my oven preheating to 375° F with convection. I'm going to toast it for probably 10 15 minutes, tossing every few minutes to make sure it's very, very even. Now, on to the cheese sauce. And I kind of want to use a dizzying array of cheeses. I just do because I have a fantastic balance of flavors here. We have kind of a sweet fudgy vibe with, you know, just a plain Jane Gouda. We have some sharpness and some funk coming from some provolone. We have some extreme cheddar sharpness coming from this carold Dubliner. We have some nuttiness and some cave-aged funk coming from some griier. We have some sharpness and parmesan-like characteristics in a much milder form with manchego. And then we have a great melter in the form of fontina. Really, it's seven cheeses with the parmesan cheese crisps. And that feels like overkill. And it is overkill, but I want to try it. So that's what we're going to do. All right, let's see how this blend of cheeses tastes as one cohesive unit. Delightful. It's got an assertive flavor, but not too assertive. Like that plus milk plus pasta, it's going to be just right. But not just saying that because I don't have any other cheese left. Just in the nick of time, our breadcrumbs are out of the oven. They're looking fairy tale, just the way that I wanted them to. They're big, fluffy, crispy, fantastic. So now onto the seventh cheese. While my oven is preheated, I'm going to make a couple of Parmesan freos or cheese crisps. So I'm going to grate this very finely into a nice little pile. I want it to melt fast. I want the fat to separate. I want the cheese to break effectively and then for it to fry in its own fat, all in short order. Otherwise, it will just dry out. This guy's going to head it into our 400° Fahrenheit oven for we'll see how many minutes until they are cheese freakos. To make our cheese sauce, I'm going to do a pretty simple mouret, but I'm going to bolster it. A little bit of sodium citrate. That should make it glossier, should make it smoother, and make it more stable. But I want the natural sort of familiar mouth feel of moure. Sorry, I said mouth feel. Here come the freakos. Nicely golden brown. Okay, 5 yard line. Let's do this. Oh, I'm nervous. Okay, over on the stove top, I have my parmesan broth in which I'm going to cook our pasta. I have 1 tbsp each butter and allpurpose flour for the base of my r. I have 1 cup of whole milk to which I'm going to add 1/4 teaspoon of sodium citrate for extra stability. And I'm going to gently heat. Milk's nice and warm. Just has to be warm for the sodium citrate to dissolve. pour it back into this measuring cup and start to stream it in. So now we have our beshmold that's been fortified with sodium citrate. So as soon as we've simmerred for about 1 to 2 minutes, I'm going to kill the heat, add the cheese. I have 227 gram or 8 oz of our cheese blend and just use the residual heat in the bashimal and in the pan to melt the cheese into what should be a pretty perfect cheese sauce. All right, here is our maci ready to be plunged into the boiling water. Give my mac a taste. See if it's done cooking. It's only been about 90 seconds. Yep, it's ready to go. Scoop it out. Add it to the sauce. I'm not going to drain it too much cuz I want some of that lovely cooking, simmering stock. Here we go, folks. It's time to make our Michelin Mac. Oh man, look at that. It'sing picture perfect. Are you kidding me? Wow. Oh, there you go, you freakos. Then we've got our giant flaky breadrumbs. And then our ridiculous chives. And of course, let's throw some super coarse FGP right on top. And there you have it, folks. Level 10 mac and cheese covered with shards of cheese and bread, herbs, and in a proprietary broth of seven cheeses with homemade maci noodles and parmesan broth. Let's see how it is. It's still so remarkably creamy. And the flavors are just wow. the parmesan. You can taste the Parmesan cheese cris crisp so distinctly and it's adding such great texture along with these huge flaky breadcrumbs and the texture of the mac. It cannot be overstated how unique and perfect it is. It's fresh homemade pasta with a cheese sauce on it that's not folding under the under the pressure. It's a first for me. That's it. That is level 10 time mac and cheese. It is mac and cheese to a tea. It ticks every box for what makes mac and cheese. But it is playful. It is profoundly flavored. It's perfectly textured. It's the best mac and cheese I've ever had in my life. And I made it. That doesn't make any sense. Thank you very much for joining me on these 10 levels of mac and cheese. Please let me know in the comments below what do you want to see me explore 10 levels of. What's next? What should I do? I'm all ears. This is the new series on the Babish channel. I'm having so much fun making it. I can't wait to make more and I can't wait to show you what we're working on. Thank you so much for watching. Thank you for sticking with me for almost 10 years now. And keep cooking. I will if you will. When I'm sad, I often make a blue box mac and cheese and eat it straight from the pot standing over the sink. Why? It's because it's comforting. It's something that says, ""I want to do what I want to do right now."" There's nothing wrong with that. It's human nature. Are you human? Do you want an honest response? Yeah. Why? Why would I ask that question and want a dishonest response? Why wouldn't you be a human? It was a really a rhetorical question. Yeah. Yeah. Why wouldn't I be a human?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

zcmWj6kjHfg,"We've all struggled. Well, if you have a halfway decent personality, you've struggled. And necessity being the mother of invention, often interesting things come out of the need to make it work with what you got. So, we asked you, ""What are your favorite struggle meals of past and present, and you answered the call over 3,000 submissions of your preferred struggle meals?"" So, I want to try it out. I want to see what you guys are eating when you got to make do with what you got. and then we're going to share a couple struggle meals of our own from our past or things that we just dreamt up that you might want to try the next time sucks. Let's get started. All right, first off, we have egg rice by Mike C. And I say Mike because they put three eyes in there. Crack three eggs into a bowl. I'm going to add a little pinch of salt to the eggs. Beat these guys up nice and smooth. I'm going to oil up my very tiniest pan. Add our eggs to our tiny tiny little pan. They were specified to be scrambled. They didn't say how scrambled in what way. So, I'm going to do things my way cuz it's my way. My way or the highway. Kind of want to prepare this like omen rice. Basically, I'm looking for the eggs to be almost done. Almost a little too runny. Looks pretty nice. Just going to kind of let it sit over very low heat. Cover it up and just let it cook for a bit. I'm trying to make a like a cooked shell on the bottom so that I can flip it over, slice it open like an omar rice. We got some microwave white rice, some sushi rice in this case. Oh, how pretty. It's going to be a perfect platform for our patty of poultry. Let's see if I can invert it without inflicting disaster. Say your prayers. Brush your teeth. Bam. So then they specify some furyake rice seasoning and of course a drizzle of Sriracha. And there you have it. Mike sees egg rice. That was easy. It's not rice, but we do have some nice custardy soft eggs underneath this scrambled egg. So then it does specify to mix it up and eat. Here we go. And it's delicious. You got some some runny egg in there. Being all runny egg about things. Then the furkake is just a lovely very subtle seasoning of sesame seeds and seaweed. Very basic seasoning adds a whole lot of personality though. You're getting good protein. You're getting good carbohydrates. Eggs being while way more expensive than they've ever been, still one of the cheaper proteins. Excellent use case. So, in terms of ease of preparation, inexpensiveness, customizability, and just general deliciousness, give it an eight. It's like essential, and it can be yours for apparently $2.50 depending on where this dude lives. Great. All right. Next up, we have Shin Hot Dog Fried Rice from Rob M17. It's basic egg fried rice with sliced hot dogs and Shin Ramen seasoning. Chop half a can of hot dogs. Can of hot dogs. >> In England, hot dogs come in cans. They're not talking about the other sausages. >> This is about the only hot dog canned hot dog option we have on this side of the pond is Vienna sausages. So, that's what we're going to use. All right, half a can. Wow, they're so soft. I think I'm going to sear the [ __ ] out of these. Get them nice and crispy. All right, we also have some microwavable white rice here. I think this is going to be fine to just throw in as though it were leftover white rice. the ideal medium for fried rice. And uh they said if you're feeling fancy, add some soy sauce and vegetables. We figured just some frozen peas, carrots, and corn. Perfect accompaniment. And it's only a tiny little bit of a dollar bag. So this is this is a great addition. Get my eggs cracked and whisked. Get that shin robin packet. And why not the vegetable mix? What could possibly go wrong? Tiny whisk that together. And might as well use the same tea whisk to beat our eggs. Good enough. We'll throw down a little bit of vegetable oil. I'm going to add our sliced Vienna sausages and add our vegetables so they start defrosting, maybe even get a little color themselves. Nice browning on those sausages. Time to add our rice. And this rice, it's microwave rice, so it's only par cooked, but we are adding water to this pan. It's going to get, you know, cooked the rest of the way. And I do think it'll soften up. If it doesn't, it's my fault. Plop that in there. If you were making this yourself, you could make some rice and do the actual fried rice thing, which is make it, cool it, put it in the fridge. Leftover rice is the ideal while we're still nice and hot while we still got some fat in the pan and introduce the eggs into the situation. Basically, you're looking to make a little scrambled egg that will then spread out the rest of the dish. Now, we're going to add our seasoning packet. A little bit of water there. I'm going to add a little bit of soy sauce, too, cuz they said add if you're feeling fancy. and that just so happened to be keep things moving so it doesn't stick. But it's also a non-stick pan. So, normally something you wouldn't necessarily want to use for fried rice, but luckily these are Babish pans and you can push them to 550° F. And there you have it. Shin hot dog fried rice. Now, I definitely was skeptical. I mean, I think anybody would be if they saw hot dog fried rice. Yeah. I mean, that's perfectly good. Um, it's spicy. Why? How is Shin Ramen spicy? >> Spicy. Yeah, >> okay. So, it's spicy. >> I don't care. >> It's good and spicy. It tastes like, you know, the flavor profile of ramen, but in a fried rice context. So, it's it plays a little bit of a trick with your mind, but in a really fun way. And the hot dogs don't bother me at all. Like, I was I was really just wanting to survive the hot dogs. They actually work pretty well. We're talking about smoky pork. If I'm ever going to eat Vienna sausages, this is how I'm going to do it. This is the essence of what a struggle meal is. Making do with what you got. Presumably, you got some canned sausages, you got some ramen, you got some rice. Make it work together. This is an excellent example. I don't like it as much as the egg rice, but I really admire the gumption of this one, and it does taste quite good in a very stony or drunk way, impaired way. And uh so I'm going to give it a seven. I enjoy it. Next we have ass risoto by Jade Kiato. Doesn't sound great, but let's give it a try. Let's see what happens. Now, as for all the stock that we're using today, stock is an expensive item. Not something I would normally recommend for a struggle meal, but I really recommend getting some of this stuff. Better than bullion. This is five six bucks and it makes 38 cups of stock and it's not bad. Like it tastes like actual chicken. I think it's better than box stock personally. So, this rice calls for a 2:1 cooking ratio. Two cups of liquid, one cup of rice. I'm going to do a little bit more than that just because I want there to be leftover liquid full of starch. I am specifically not washing the rice. I don't want to rinse off the excess starch because it will help make things creamy. You do want to give it an initial stir, but then we're going to do two things. We're going to not touch this until we're ready to eat it or turn it into carbonara. And we're going to let it rest for almost as long as we let it cook. So, this gu is going to go for 15 minutes. Then, we're going to let it sit for 15 minutes. That is essential in making rice cooked correctly. Took me many moons to figure that one out. All right, our rice is cooked and rested. It's nice and hot, which is what we need cuz we need carryover heat to melt some Parmesan cheese. Throw some salt in there. Risotto loves pepper. I don't think this was specified in the recipe, but what are they going to do? And now, kind of just like a carbonara. It's got me a little nervous. I'm going to scramble this egg, but going to add this one beaten egg. Keep things moving. And God willing, we'll have something edible. I'm going to add a little bit of water because things are looking a little dry and we want this to be thick and creamy. Not unlike a risoto, but a risoto that does not look like risoto. I mean, it's the wrong rice, but it's thick and gloopy. A little taste for seasoning before we go too deep here. Hey. Hey. I challenge you to find an Italian that can tell the difference. We secretly switch these Italians risoto with folders coffee. Let's see if they can tell the difference. I'm going to hit it with a little bit more Parmesan and definitely some more pepper just for looks really. And let's give it a try. [Music] I wouldn't call that ass risoto Jade Kyoto. It's not risoto. You can tell from the rice. It's It's too tender. It's not the right consistency. It should have a little bit of chew, a little al dente to it. Um, but the gooey texture of the sauce, the egg really makes things creamy if you add it quickly. In the same way that a carbonara is creamy, the egg makes it creamy. I can't believe that you can do that without stirring. We're making a risoto here without stirring. It's got me wondering what I can do with our boreo rice. Making a risoto without stirring. It's delicious. There's nothing bad about this. I'm inclined to give it a nine. I never would have thought basically do the carbonara method to make a creamy risoto. That's actually pretty inspired. Um, so for that reason, I'm going to give it a nine. This is thinking outside the box. This is the kind of invention that comes from necessity. If you were, you know, trying to make a quick, easy, filling meal with all you got is rice and parmesan cheese and an egg, this is a really interesting way to go. Like, I am down. Great job, Jade Kyoto. Next up, we have Marines on toast by Big Dave, who is apparently British because this is about the most British thing I've ever heard of. It has some interesting elements here. This is basically beans on toast with extra cheese. And they are putting some Marmite in the baked beans. We went for the the Hines beans and tomato sauce. It's about as British as you can get. So, I'm heating this up and I'm going to add some Marmite to it. I'm actually pretty stoked on this cuz I'm not crazy about Marmite on its own, but as an ingredient, very exciting. Ooh, it's making them dark and glossy. I like this. Got some toast. Drippy oil butter. We're baking it with cheese, topping it with beans, then topping that with cheese. This is weird. Putting a slice of bread inside of an air fryer with cheese on top of it. We'll say it. Strange. And boom goes the dynamite. Oh yeah, that is some melted cheese on some bread. Oh. Oh. Come here, little guy. Big British Dave specified pre-shredded cheese. I wouldn't recommend this for two reasons. First off, you end up with this when you melt pre-shredded cheese. the shreds almost keep their identity instead of becoming one singularity. And also because getting your own block of cheddar and shredding it is cheaper. You know what folks? It depends on the struggle. If time is your struggle, then I get it. If money is your struggle, I don't get it. The British are such a interesting culinary populace. They also specified to top a bit more shredded cheese. Something about unmelted cheese is about as struggle meal as the day is long. Last but not least, a good sprinkle of spicy chili flakes. That's pretty good. I never disliked beans on toast, but I never like sought it out either. It was never a thing for me. Far too foreign a concept. The Marmite just amps up the umami. It brings a whole bunch of basically MSG. Like it's just adding a ton of savory, unuous flavor. And the cheese is cheese and the bread is toast. So, I don't know. There's not much to be mad at here. It's tasty. It's definitely not like doing anything special for me, but I think if you were a beans on toast kind of kind of kind of person, this would do something for you. This would get you this would this would get some ants in your pants a little bit. I'm gonna give it a six personally because I'm not a big beans on toast guy, but I would give normal beans on toast a three. It's really only a struggle meal if you're if you're if you're in the UK because who the hell is making struggle meals with Marmite here on the in the States? That's a specialty ingredient over here. That's a huge improvement on beans on toast. Good job, Big Dave. Now we have not quite chili by tongues. It's tongues with two 's. There's a lot of abuse of the alphabet here today. So, we've got our cup of lentils cooked until mush. Now, I'm going to add one can of chopped tomatoes. Per instructions. More garlic and onion seasoning than I would think I would need. I'm adding what I think is too much. Doing that for you tongles pow. And adobo seasoning. That doesn't look terribly appetizing if I'm being honest. And there we have it. Not quite chili. An assessment that I would agree with, but let's throw some cottage cheese on there just to really get there. Well, it's healthy. I'll tell you that much. Eat this whole bowl. It would look just like this coming back out. But it'd be very healthy. It's not bad. Like it tastes a little dystopian like this is nutrition paste with flavor. Not with flavor. You know, I don't like cottage cheese very much. But I don't know that this is cottage cheese in this context. It's just this goop on top that it kind of has a sour cream effect. The adobo seasoning is actually the best part. I think that brings some unique flavor that isn't just spice rack. I think if you did something about the color and maybe making it spicy, you'd be looking at a six or a seven. And I'm going to give it a five as it is, just cuz I really don't like looking at it. I do wish the lentils weren't overcooked. I think you can just cook them normal. And the cottage cheese. This is the most I have ever tolerated cottage cheese. Thank you for making me lactose tolerant, so to speak. Didn't even write that beforehand. That just came out of my head. All right. Next up, we have Go Jang Dal from Izzy. It's just my name. I don't care if you just use my first name. It's an interesting name. All right, so let's get started. Um, let's fry up our aromatics. This is the first one where you're like frying aromatics. So, we're definitely on the less struggly end of struggle meals here, but it might be a timing thing, and it might be just like here's how you get some fiber, some protein, and use up the stuff in the fridge. Finely chopped scallion, just the whites. Two cloves of crushed garlic, some pickled pinños, rinsed red lentils. Let these get a little toasted up. Now we're going to cover them. We're going to add a huge scoop of gou jang. Tons of flavor, tons of spice. We got some frozen veggies here for bonus points. Soy sauce and ketchup to taste. And now we're going to let this cook until it is mush. Basically, the dish of dah in my mind is is is more like a soup. So I want this to be soupesque, but you can, you know, live your life however you want. just, you know, don't listen to me. And after about a halfhour cook, we end up with something resembling doll, or at least the soup version of it. So, we're garnishing with some sour cream or fat-free yogurt. Fresh vegetables, not usually something I think of with a struggle meal. But that being said, I remember when I was struggling, there was a uh vegetable market near me that had all this about to be uh rotten produce, like 2 days left of solvency, and it would be cheap as free. Uh so, you know, you never know what you're going to come across. And if you come across some fresh produce, find interesting ways to use it. Some of our scallion greens. Go Jang doll. Let's see what's happening here. It's got the flavor of a spicy chicken nugget. I don't know why, but there we are. I was supposed to finish with a little bit of acid. So, let's just drizzle some of this here. Jalapeno pickling liquid over top. [Music] It really needs that hit of acid. That actually really helps. Like that brings a kind of just different uh uh facet to it. So there's more layered flavors and and um I think it's too spicy. Like it's just generally sp. It's not like it's too spicy. It's that all I taste is just spicy. That's it. I am missing the flavor profile of an Indian doll. There's like, you know, there's some cumin in there. They put a nice roasted chili in there. Usually it's a simpler flavor, but I like I prefer it. Um, all that to be said, if you want a big bowl of something spicy, filling, hearty, nutritious, and that uses up stuff you might have in the fridge, this is a this is a great option. This is a tasty use of staple ingredients. That being said, it's not something I'd want to make again. So, I think I'm going to give it a six cuz it's better than it needed to be. It's not doing anything where it's like, ""Oh, damn. This worked out."" It's just like, ""Oh, damn. This worked out."" All right. Next up from Matt Farah, we have spicy peanut ramen. I'm going to start by combining all the flavor agents. We got a little bit of soy sauce, a little bit of toasted sesame oil. This stuff is strong and you can always garnish with it later. Chili crisp. Peanut butter and chili crisp. Yes, please. A not insignificant amount of that cuz I love chili crisp. Uh, I'm going to go pretty light on the garlic and onion powder just because I have to assume there's already a fair amount of that in the ramen seasoning packet. It feels like putting hat in a hat here. Not mixing together in a way that I super like, but that's okay. This is going to be good. This is going to be good. All right, ramen noodles been cooked. I'm going to drain out all but a little bit of water before adding the sauce. Maybe like twoish tablespoons of water. This honestly is the one I'm most excited for. I really think this is going to spank, which hasn't caught on the way I hoped it would. Meanwhile, raw dog has climbed the charts of what all the kids say. Raw dog this homework mom. And now I want it redder. I want it spicier. So, I'm going to hit it with a little bit more chili crisp. Top it with some sliced scallions. And honestly, the best looking bowl of instant ramen I think I've ever seen. Like, that looks great. Let's see if this is what the doctor told us not to eat. In other words, if it tastes good. I want some kind of sweetness. But other than that, this is dank. Using only condiments, you made ramen feel like a more complete food. And that's pretty cool if you ask me. So, I think I'm going to give it a nine. Like, I love it. It tastes so good. Every single element in here plays off the other and improves the dish overall. I love it. I'd eat this whole bowl right now if I didn't have other stuff to make it eat. Bacon egg fried ramen by Parker Twambble on Instagram. I'll fry up these bacon pieces. Bits you might call them. You'll notice that I'm starting these off in a cold pan and that's to help the fat render out so that they cook a little bit more slowly but end up a little bit more uniformly crisp. We're going to cook this bacon in butter for some reason. Beating up my egg. Taking its lunch money. They said to put the seasoning packet in the egg, right? >> I believe so. I'll double check to add it to the scrambled egg, but I like that. >> Too late. That just became the saltiest egg on the planet. Now, we're going to add our noodles to our bacon butter. Now, we have our seasoned egg. It didn't have really any instructions as to how this is ideally prepared, so I'm just going to kind of That seems right. That looks like a breakfast ramen to me. They said to add >> a splash of olive oil. >> I'm not going to do that. There's so much fat in here. It's insane. That was so much sesame oil. Nice little bit of Sriracha and some Gigg Pow Pow. All right, we got our Sriracha. We got our garlic powder. And we have a ton of sesame oil. Fried bacon egg ramen. Exactly what it sounds like with some Sriracha that you didn't expect. A little bit of everything. I mean, what did we think this was going to be? Bad. Bacon and Sriracha and eggs. I will say it's so greasy. There's so much fat in here. You got sesame oil, you have butter, and you have bacon fat. It's too much. If you're going to make this, I would recommend don't put butter in there and drain off the bacon fat. Keep a little bit in there cuz it tastes really good. But like, you know, when you eat something really greasy, your lips just it's like you put, you know, strawberry lip gloss on. It's like this this film that just covers you. That's happening to your inside, too. And you're going to feel it. And I already do. A mixed bag here. Tastes really good. Needs some tweaks for for ideal execution. I think if it weren't so greasy, I'd give it a seven. I'm going to give it a six for greasiness. That's a first and that's a promise. So, last up, we have the [ __ ] off, I'm drunk. That was submitted by Call Me Nocturna. I don't know why they wouldn't just say Nocturna, if that's what they want to be called. This one is very drunk indeed. The technique and the flavors are both unhinged. Let's see what happens. Should I be drunk? Excuse me. I'm making counterintuitive decisions. My blood sugar has both spiked and dropped somehow at the same time. Normally, I need junk food to soak up the alcohol. I've never needed alcohol to soak up the junk food. This This is an appropriate tool for me to be using. This This spatula is peak struggle years for me. I remember getting this at IKEA. I think this was like the only utensil I could afford. I could get a pot and this and like a pillow or something. Like I had no budget to get anything and this guy has stuck with me for a long, long time. Fitting that I make this egg with it. Meanwhile, I already don't feel good about that. Sweet and sour sauce and Sriracha. No amounts specified. All right. So, they specified adding a little bit of hot water to the bowl. So, I'm just going to use some of this runoff for adding the nudes. They then say to put a fried egg on top. Why? This This one's got me wigged out. Qy mayo, Sriracha. >> Oh, wait. No. Cupid mayo, pepperjack cheese, and chili crisp. >> Sriracha. I just decided we'll just lighten up on the chili crisp a little bit because that'll have the same effect. And we have shredded pepper jack cheese on top. That's the thing I always thought ramen was missing was mayo and cheese. And there you have it. The aptly named off. I'm drunk. I can't judge that, can I? I'm going to mix it up. Here we go. Chop the egg. Get the egg. Chop the up the up the egg. Lightly pre digested for you. I bet it's going to taste good. I'm drunk. [Music] Spicy. Okay. To be fair, we use Shin Ramen, which is a spicy ramen. God, that's spicy. And it also tastes like I was just punched in the face by my fridge door and all the condiments flew out in directly into my mouth. It It tastes insane. Doesn't taste bad, but it also tastes insane. I think it's a little too much. I think you could lose any two things. Pick two and you probably still have something worth eating. But like this is too much. The texture is intense. The flavor is intense. The look is intense. it because it I mean it looks you know taking into account the fact that I have had so much insane food today and I'm starting to not feel well. I still don't think I can rate this any higher than a five because it is truly something you do when you're drunk. When you're drunk you do counterintuitive things like put putting mayo on your ramen. It's aggressive. It's mean. I'm going to give it a five. I think that uh uh it's too much. I don't even know what to say. My brain's melting. What year was I born? All right, so it's the next day if you couldn't tell by my very slightly different shirt. Very slight. No collar. That's the dead giveaway. Last night when I was in bed, I imagined Steve asking me an interesting question. What if I could send some recipes back in time to my struggle self? What would they be? And I I laid there in bed, nude, of course, pondering what Steve had asked me. So, I dreamed up a couple recipes that I think are in line with what we were making yesterday. That is a starch with a lot of flavorful sauces and some added nutritional benefit. I'm going to do one lentil, one pasta, one rice, and then I'm going to get sappy. Stick around. And all three of these recipes use a lot of overlapping ingredients. So, with a minimal grocery shop and minimal pantry ingredients, you should be able to make all three of these for a ton of variety and flavor. So, first up, I'm going to make congi. This is a rice porridge that's as old as time. It's a great way to stretch rice. It's very easy to digest if you're sick. It's very comforting and it's endlessly customizable. So, I've got four cups of water to 1/2 cup of rice. I'm not going to rinse the rice because I want that extra starch in there to make it thick. Bring it to a simmer and hold it there until it's porridge. Simple as that. It's going to take different amounts of time depending on what kind of rice you're using. Okay, congani is done. How do you know when it's done? When it looks like this. You could even thin it out more if you want. This is a nice thick congi. So to serve, we are piling it high and proud in a bowl. Ideally, you might want to use a wider bowl so that way your toppings are easier to eat with the rest of the congi. But in this case, just re up with more toppings as you eat. We're just going to make a really fully loaded kongji. I have sauteed peppers and onions, crispy mushrooms. I got some bacon, and you know, just whatever else you can conjure up out of the fridge. A lot of struggle meals are just what do we have in the fridge? How can I put it together? Congi is a great answer because you can put damn near anything savory on there. There you have it. Congi fully loaded, loaded for bear, armed and dangerous. I forgot to salt the kanji. You're going to want to salt that kanji. It's going to be kind of like the toppings where you just season as you go. Eat our way down till there's nothing tasty left and then start all over. It's a very simple, very economical base. Once again, it's very good if you're sick or if you need something, you know, very basic, but once you load it up with stuff, it turns into an actual hearty, flavorful, exciting meal. So, kungji for your consideration. So, now on to the subject of ketchup. Ketchup finds its way into a great many struggle meals because it's a prolific condiment usually in the US. It's versatile and it's fun. So, I'm going to take a page out of the book of Japan and I'm going to make spaghetti Neapolitan. Bacon, vegetables, ketchup, spaghetti, garlic. It's delicious and it comes together in less than 20 minutes. So, to make spaghetti Neapolitan, you need two pans. I have a big one with heavily salted water coming to a boil here for the spaghette. And then I have a non-stick pan to build the sauce and finish the pasta. I'm going to start with four slices of bacon chopped into mouthsized bits. Something else I'm going to do. Let's steal a little bit of water here. Normally when you cook bacon, you're frying it with direct heat. So the outside is going to start to brown before all the fat is rendered out. Which means that if you want to get it really crispy, you're in danger of burning it. By adding a little bit of water and letting the bacon poach basically for a few minutes, you're helping to render out the fat faster without browning. Once this water evaporates, you've got rendered fat ready to crisp things up without making anything rubbery or burnt. I'm using this thing to preserve as much fat as I can, but if you just fished it out with tongs, that'd be fine. A fork. Just be careful if it's a non-stick pan. Okay, so now we have all this beautiful bacon fat. It's a little bit too much. I'm I'm going to reduce it a little bit. I'm adding mushrooms. These are sliced baby bell mushrooms. Pretty cheap. This was a one lb package for like 250. As soon as they hit the pan, I'm tossing them around because mushrooms suck up fat like sponges. So, I want to make sure that everybody is getting an even dose of fat. And what we're going to do here is just sauté the mushrooms. And when we do that, you're going to see an otherworldly amount of water exit these mushrooms. That basically needs to evaporate, cook off so that then these mushrooms can sizzle in the fat. And I want to get these not crispy or anything, but I just want to get them some mayard, some caramelization. All right, we got some great browning on the mushrooms. So now I'm going to start adding other veg. I'm going to do some nice thin sliced onion, green bell pepper. Just want to get a little color on these veg. Soften them up a little bit. And then we're going to build the sauce. Our veg is nearing completion. So, I'm going to add our sketi. Just like any self-respecting pasta, we're going to finish the pasta in the sauce. I'm going to start by adding some pasta water because I don't want the ketchup to burn when I add it. I'm adding about about 1/3 cup of pasta water. Good gug of soy sauce and about 2/3 3/4 of a cup of ketchup. Mix that up. I've increased the heat a little bit under my sauce. Want to get things nice and sizzly. You can see some parts where it's a little thinner. They're caramelizing, getting bubbly. That's just going to translate to some deeper, sweeter flavors. My pasta is about 1 minute undercooked. That's the time to add it. Way too thick. We're going to thin that right the hell out. I'm actually going to cover it up so that the pasta all sucks up water cuz the stuff that's in the water is going to suck it up and stuff on top is just going to sit there. And now I'm going to add the bacon back as it finishes cooking. Now I'm going to add one tablespoon of butter in a weird shape. Black pepper. Good sprinkle of Parmesan cheese. Now to serve. Just going to put a bunch in the bowl. And then I didn't taste it for seasoning. I said I was going to do it. Got a fork and added my ass back to the stone. And then we're going to garnish with our bacon and some more Parmesan. And there you have it. Spaghetti Neapolitan. This is a Japanese favorite. Let's give it a shot. Crispy bacon, rich sauce, spaghetti. Need I say more? It's great. It surprises you with how great it is. I get not keeping tomato sauce around as often as you have ketchup. So, if that's all you got, here's how you want to do it. All right. Next up, one that I'm pretty curious about, which is lentil sloppy joe's, or as I'm going to call them, sloppy jaspers. Sounds like a vegetarian, right? the idea of using lentils as a ground beef replacement. I've heard that it works almost in a onetoone capacity where you just use it as though it were cooked ground beef. So, I'm curious to see how it comes out, how it tastes, how it feels. Treating the mushrooms the same way I did with the Neapolitan pasta. We're going to cook them first with a little bit of salt to draw out the moisture, get them to brown, then add everything else. I'm going to add some chopped onion, some more of that chopped green bell pepper. Sauté those bad boys together. Little bit of cumin, chili powder, a little bit of garlic powder. And I'm just adding those to the dry pan so they can toast for just like a second. Add some more chicken stock. I'm going to add tablespoons worth of oyster. The last of my ketchup. Nice squirt of barbecue sauce. Will do no harm. Little gug of hot sauce. I'm also going to add my chopped up bacon. We're not trying to keep it crispy. We're just trying to get that flavor in there. And we're probably going to add some sugar of some kind as well. You could add honey. You could add brown sugar molasses. I got some of this here, blackstrap molasses. This is going to darken the color, which is going to be helpful once we add all these very light colored lentils. These lentils are a little overcooked, so they're they don't have as much of their structure as I would like, but they're still going to be good. All right, it's definitely pretty loose for sloppy joe mixture. So you might want to undercook the lentils by about 5 minutes less than whatever the packaging says. So then it can finish cooking in the sauce. Whatever recipe we put on the website is going to reflect that. So if you follow that written recipe should be all good. Now I've got my waiting bun here to receive my slop. Also, why do we not put cheese on sloppy joe's? I'm asking why. And there we have it. are kind of vegetarian, not really, are lentil sloppy gem. And this is one that is just going to cost you a fraction of the money to make and it's going to be way healthier. There's a lot of fiber in this. There's protein in this. These are good carbs. It'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 a sloppy one, but hey, that struggle meals for you. You overcook your lentils, you're not going to toss it and start again. Got to make it work with what you got. The flavor's there. It's for sure meaty. I think the texture is what gives it away. Not only is this overcooked, but also lentils are never going to have the same texture as beef. Yeah, it's definitely not going to pass for beef, but at the same time, it's tasty. It's really like delicious, and it's better for you, and it's cheaper. So, ideal struggle gist, cook those lentils less before you add them to the sauce. Let them finish cooking in the sauce, and then you'll be a the sloppiest kid on the block. So, there you have it. Three new recipes to add to your rolodex of things to make when you got to make it work. And this whole process has had me thinking, what would I say if I could talk to myself when I was in the most challenging times in my life? And the answer might sound odd at first, bake bread. Hear me out. So struggle takes many shapes. Mental, emotional, spiritual, physical, financial. You could be haunted by your past or terrified of your future, pressed for time, behind on rent, all the above. So suggesting that you bake bread at barely a nominal savings and a huge cost of time is an odd proposition. But bread is not only an essential, it is essential. Its invention precipitated the growth and advancement of humankind. And in a much smaller way, it could precipitate yours. Everyone needs a hobby. And it's about as inexpensive and rewarding a hobby as you can imagine. And your growing fluency in its creation pays you back with better results than you'll find in the supermarket. Making something taste better is a small thing, but it's also the root goal of struggle meals. The effort of making basic ingredients into something worth eating. And for me, it changes the definition of struggle meal. Because sure, a PB&J is a wonderful thing, but a PB&J on bread you baked yourself, it becomes suffused with meaning, purpose, personality. It's the thin, almost invisible line between struggling to survive and struggling so that you can grow. By no means is this a prescription or fix for a difficult situation. And it's an outlandish suggestion at that, but it's one I hope you consider because at least in my case, it might have made my plain toast breakfast feel a little less empty. I hope you learn something new that you might want to try. And more than that, I hope you can find some joy amidst the struggle. Because somewhere there's a future self that's looking back on you with gratitude for surviving, for making it work," for not giving up. I know I do.

B1lPqICR12E,"To make authentic larb, you need to get your hands on some Thai glutenous rice. And then this stuff is heading into a dry skillet. Dry roast these grains for about 15 to 20 minutes over medium low heat and allow it to cool completely before we pulverize it into powder. We're just going to thinly slice the shallot, thinly slice the scallions, and then we're going to very finely chop the lemongrass. We are heating a few tablespoons of vegetable oil over mediumigh heat until shimmering. Adding one lb of ground pork, adding the lemongrass during the last minute of cooking. Once it is fully cooked, we are removing it from the heat. A few generous pinches of Thai chili powder, an eighth of a tablespoon of sugar, half a tablespoon of fish sauce, double squeeze of lime juice, our pre-prepared vegetables, bunch of mint leaves, and then a generous couple tablespoons of our kokua. In the movie, it looks like it's being served with lettuce. So, I'm just going to pile this up here and make me some little lettuce wraps. Lots and lots of cilantro. I got to say, this stuff rules. It's got complex flavor. It's nice and spicy. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go finish these off without altering them in the slightest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9rW46IT_uTw,"barbecue. One of the very few distinctly American cuisines. But did you know that it's all fancy now? All right, so first up, we must ready our cheeks. No, not those cheeks. Our beef cheeks. Starting by trimming off any excess exterior fat. Once you got them all nice and trimmed, we're going to prepare for them the so-called tuxedo blend and spread it evenly and generously over the cheeks. Now, these guys are headed into the fridge uncovered for at least two nights before being introduced to our smoker, which is set at 225° and after which time you should find that they have grown hard as beefy little rocks. Fear not, these guys are going to soften up in the next step. There's very few ways to make beef even beefier. But the first that springs to mind is, well, beef fat, specifically rendered tallow. Then, to take the flavor even further, I'm going to add a pound of challenge butter. Then the sky gets tightly covered with aluminum foil back onto the smoker for 4 hours. Cheeks are off the smoker and we've held them in a cooler for 2 hours before slicing and marveling at its color, texture, and most of all, its frankly obscene level. That's so insane. Deeply flavored, but also wildly tender. 100% the thing I'm going to be making at every barbecue from this day forth till the day I meet the dirt Joe Dirt. I hope to meet him one day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hQJLBfYYsq8,"Just like everybody else, on their 18th birthday, I was restrained, shaved, and asked a very simple question. Are you a Maximista or a Marshallista? TJ Maxx and Marshalls. Two stores, usually right next to each other, that you go to thinking you're getting two different shopping experiences. However, they are owned by the same company, TJX Companies, which owns TJ Maxx, Marshalls, and HomeGoods, and some other called Sierra that I've never heard of. Just like everybody else, I've always gone to TJ Maxx and been like, ""Wow, I just got some great deals."" But what does Marshalls have to offer? Usually some different brands, but it's the same guy. Making you think, ""Oh, these guys must hate each other. They always buy stores right next to one another. How could that be possible?"" So, we're going to go to TJ Maxx and Marshalls and we're going to visit their pantry aisles, which just like their clothes are off-brand and from last season. Let's go see what we can find. All right, we made it to the TJ Maxx and Marshalls in Chelsea. And as usual, there's one right next to the other. Which one do you want to do first? Up or down? Got to go down. Got to go down. I've never gone down to a Marshalls with another guy before. If you think I'm not doing some personal shopping while we're here, you're out of your mind. Here's the Dubai chocolate. We got to try it, I guess. Ube coconut rolls. It's cool because I have to imagine that these were all startups that tried out a new product. It didn't work. They found a second life here and we get to try it. God, look at all the Orchard Valley. What kind of fruit and chocolate do you want, dude? Heavenly Hunks. They named a product after me. That's awesome. Little Temptations. Like, I don't even know if we're going to rank all this. Just to have I like to try some of these. I didn't expect there to be so much. I actually need a rotary cheese. Like, no one needs a rotary cheese grater, don't get me wrong, but like I'd like to have one. What kind of pickled vegetable do we get? Carrots or asparagus? I mean, that's grosser and more hilarious. Yeah. Come on. Let me get takalitos, Steve. Come on. I want taco. Okay, fine. Okay, Steve. I didn't know what I was getting into. I just want to point out that it's July. Can I get it? Can I get it? Well, you have to carry it home. It's called motorized rage fire insanity. Look at the amount of ammo on this thing. I love the the names of the brands here. It's like denim flower. I have a shirt at home from here that's called uh cactus man. That's the brand. Like what? Who are you? Who comes to Marshalls to get food? You come here for clothes and you buy food as a as a as an impulse buy. I like to think that what we do is unique. We just bought more than I've ever bought at Marshalls. Let's go to TJ Maxx. I think TJ Maxx is nicer. I think we might have up. If the food's nicer. Uh-oh. They got stuff behind glass. This is way nicer. It's laid out so much nicer. Damn, we screwed up. Oh, these are the same things. This is the same stuff. All right, I don't need these chocolate coins. This is effectively the same thing. Let's just get out of here. This is not worth waiting in line for. Babage fam, we got some gold. Babage fam, let's get out of here. Let's get the hell out of here. I'm a fully grown adult, but I still have to like take a step and get my bearings before I get on a an escalator. I don't want to be the first guy to ever fall on an escalator. [Music] And we're back. Candy Dreams priced at $4.99. We have Each one of these lollipops is a distinct unique flavor and a distinct unique Okay, I love that. $4.99 you're getting watermelon, pineapple, blackberry, orange, strawberry, and lemon. And they come with delightful illustration therein. Look at this. Nobody asked them to do this. They only did it for whimsy. That's the only reason they just have been solid yellow and everybody would have been like, ""Fine. Been a long time since I've been a child."" Doesn't smell like anything. That tastes like the lollipops from the bank. So, not terrible. I don't know what I'm expecting from a lollipop. I love that it's a wooden stick. Pineapple. I'm not joking. That tastes like communion wine. This tastes like welter scrap juice, not communion wine, but it tastes like welter scrap. This does not taste like pineapple. Well, this is a real mixed bag of monkeys. These are basic human candy. I would give them a five if they were just plain color. I'm going to give them a six for this stuff going on here cuz that is admirable. Snickers coffee. Exclamation point. That's what I feel about this that that this exists and I haven't heard of it. $8 for this coffee. That's half the price of La Cologne. You can't tell me that's not a bad a good bargain. Just coffee. It's just It's just coffee. If I had drank this without the use of my eyes, then I would be like, that's some mildly hazelnut coffee. This just only tastes like a mildly flavored coffee. And it does taste like hazelnut coffee. Making me wonder, does hazelnut coffee actually even taste like hazelnut or is this just hazelnut coffee? And they'll be like, just call it Snickers coffee. Who gives a It tastes very flat and stale. It's pregrown coffee and I got it at Marshalls, so it's not the beacon of freshness, probably. I'll give you a fork. They taste stale. It tastes really flat. Organic coconut rolls with ube flavor. Color me interested. Which I think is purple. Suitable for vegetarians. [Applause] I've never seen that before. Made in Thailand. Okay. They're not as brilliant bright royal purple as they are on the bag. So, right off the bat, it's going to cost you many, many points. I love ube. I love coconut. I don't know what that is. I'm sure it's coconut. I do taste coconut. I don't know if this is their intended texture, but it tastes like I opened this up and left it open during a very humid week. These taste so stale. It might be what they're supposed to taste like. They're coconut crisps. I think I can taste the ube flavor. It's a very subtle flavor that always has kind of reminded me of like like a fruity vanilla almost. I taste coconut. Flavor is lovely. Texture is abhorent. I can't in my right mind give these better than a four. I wouldn't eat any more of them. I love the way they taste. Don't want to put another one in my mouth. It is July and Marshalls featured an entire Halloween aisle. Not even in the Halloween aisle. Just in the pantry sundry aisle was this candy cauldron harvest mix, which doesn't say at all what it is. It doesn't say everything nice. Candy Cauldron, which seems more like a brand. This This is the brand. Candy Cauldron Harvest Mix. What is it? I mean, I can tell by looking at it, but you can't trust me, the consumer. Whose idea was it to put brown on the candy corn? Whose idea was it to make this dirt candy corn? There's a couple normal pumpkins in there. There's a couple normal corns, but then you got these mistakes. When I look through this bag, it looks like the colors bled together. Doesn't look right to me. It's shriveled. These normally shriveled like that. Yeah, it does taste a little dried out. like it's not as soft and like something about candy corn when you chew it, it almost turns creamy in the mouth. This doesn't do that. It feels dried out. So, I wonder if those wrinkles are legit. It tastes sort sort of like normal candy corn, but then it's got this odd fruity flavor behind it. Very, very, very subtle. Like, you have to be paying attention to the candy corn that you're eating, which I don't think anybody does. Candy corn is pretty awful to begin with. I think I would rate normal candy corn at a four because it's like candy that you have to tolerate. And this is a step worse. So, I'll give it three. [Music] Dip and Dots cake poppers, which Dip and Dots, if I'm not mistook, are a frozen ice cream treat. And this is a room temperature cake pop. Bite-sized bliss without the stick, without that horrible stick to get in your way. Yeah, cake pops. Fudgy to the point where they feel like they were never just never baked. Like when you make cake pops, you take baked cake, you mix it with frosting, and you make this moist, dense core that then you dip in chocolate. And this moist, dense core tastes like and feels like if you underbaked a cake hilariously and scooped out the center and ate it like like porridge. It's dense to the point of being chewy. The outside I thought was at least going to have the decency to be chocolate. I think it's fondant. It sucks. I don't like it. It kind of tastes like brownie flavored cereal or something. Two of these are 140 calories. That sucks. They still taste like sugar. I'll give them a three. They don't taste like horrible. They're just bad. Next up, Mossio socks. 15 pairs for 10 bucks. Got this specifically because it was a brand I have never heard of, and that's what Marshalls and TJ Maxx is all about. All right. All right. These are a sock size 10 to 13, shoe size 6 to 12, which what? You know, I think that this is a sock worn exclusively by uncles. And I am an uncle. These are fine. For 66 cents a pair, they're fine. I'll give them a five. They're socks. I'll get back to you in after I've worn them for a year. We'll see how they wear and we'll make a short. We'll see how these do after a couple washes on not the delicate setting. Corinero. Corinero. Not only is it an incomprehensible name, they just shoved a heart in there. I don't think that's a surrogate for another letter. But like if you had Doritos and you just put a heart in between the T and the I dory hearttoast. Macarons. Hopefully pistachio. Macarons filled with pistachio flavored natural flavored cream. Let's see if that's the truth. to be that cynical to make something like this and call it a macaroon. Macaroons are supposed to have something of a chew to them. They're supposed to be at the very least soft. I' I'd rather these be sandwich cookies that look like macaroons, but instead they're just powder. The pistachio flavor is horrible. It tastes like pistachio scented hand soap. It's terrible. Pistachio candle. The texture is insane. There's a weird vegetital flavor, too. Zero. Worthless. [Music] Next up, we have Eminel San Francisco Dolmas stuffed vine leaves with extra virgin olive oil. $3.99 for Ken Dolma. Those look really good actually. Like they they look really normal. This surprisingly has a really great texture. The leaf is very tender. Sometimes you get a light leaf that kind of pulls off a little bit. And the rice is genuinely like al dente. There's a good chew to this. It's a very plain flavor. I wish they had like more dill in there or something. I could use some more oregano. I mean, these are a very plain snack. I can't hold that against them. I'm impressed with how good it is coming out of a can. I would never I would not have guessed that this came I've never had much canned dolma. Perfectly fine dolma. I've had worse. I have had worse. Look at the six. They're good. Can't believe it came out of a can. Tom and Luke. Nourishment for healthy lifestyles. Fruit and nut snackables. Personal trainer and chef Tom and Luke. Best friends, even though one's jacked and the other one's, you know, chef. It's not a bad name, but it also is snackables. Oh, I'll tell you, as far as energy pucks go, those are pretty good. They taste undeniably healthy. They don't taste like pea protein. That's cool. They're vegan, gluten-free, no added sugar. They actually have a great chewy texture. still tastes like health food, but prim primarily they taste like coconut, a little bit of caramel from the just flavor they added and dates. It's it's a great texture. It's a good flavor. It's healthy. It was a seven. They're good. I'm going to keep eating those later. You threw a candle. Jesus Christ. Next up, we have something that I think is as TJ Maxx as the day is long. A pumpkin spice candle. I bet they have pumpkin spice all year because it is July. $7.99. The glass cracked. Yep. That smells like the gift shop on the main street of the small town in rural upstate New York or Maine or East Coast small towns main street gift shop. go in, you smell like cinnamon and wood and there's crafts as far as the I can see and and and postcards and knitted things and your partner just goes nuts and insists on going in. But you're a guy and that's dumb. Anyway, that's what this smells like. I actually love those shops. This doesn't smell uh very good and cracks if you use a blowtorrch to light it for way too long. That's going to cost you. I only got one one speed torch. It's a pumpkin spice candle. I'll give it a four. [Music] Chunk nibbles. They call me chunk nibbles. Strawberry sweet and salty clusters. You can't say that. You can't just say they're straw sweet and salty clusters of what? They're good. You're getting two different kinds of crunch. One from the pretzel, one from the corn squares, which I assume are checkex mix. One is kind of like a bready thick crunch, the pretzel, and then the corn squares have this light shattery crunch. So you got a great mixture of textures in there. So yeah, you got white chocolate that's holding together pieces of pretzel and checkex mix and some freeze-dried strawberries thrown in there for the mix. It's good. And they have other flavors that I think I would like more like peanut butter chocolate apple cinnamon toffee. That sounds great. Peppermint doesn't. Never mind. But it's good. I'd keep eating these. It doesn't have a super natural flavor with the strawberries because they're freeze-dried, which still tastes like strawberry. It tastes like a freeze-dried strawberry. It's good. I'm going to give these a um I'll give them a seven. What's next? And will it be a spit or a kiss? Taco. We have a Taki competitor. Spicy chili in line. Get your flavor on. Ah, super bright angry red. Oh, some of them have unfurled and shown their true state, which is like a flap. They have the same insane color as Takis, but none of the same awful other attributes. They taste like corn. They taste like a corn chip. And you can taste the oil in there. You can taste the frying fat. They track your fingers the same way your Flamin' Hots do. But the flavor is surprisingly mild. Really good. Just like a little bit of acidity, but not so much like Takis are sour. They're just straight up sour to me and they're like too spicy. This tastes like a nice spice mix. Little tiny bit of heat back there. Little tiny bit of acidity. I think there's a way more balanced Taki flavor-wise and better texture, too. They're a little thinner. Like the actual flap that gets rolled up. Like that is a little thinner than than what a Taki gets. And as a result, they're less crunchy and they're more shattering. I never thought I'd say this, but I'm about to bust into this bag. at their suggestion. I'd snack on these all day. I'm gonna give them an eight to f in Italia. Made in Italy with a dolch kubet. The wafers are crafted in Italy's countryside by artisal bakers whose mission it is to bring you Kubeti's signature texture and taste. My mission is to bring you Kubet's signature texture and taste. That's my mission. I'm Italian. Didn't think that was going to happen. These are fine. They're just like chocolate wafers pretty much. They do have a less chocolate cream filling than I thought from looking at them. The chocolate flavor is very, very good. It's a high quality dark chocolate flavor. European chocolate for sure. They taste good. They're a little dry. For that reason, I'll give them a six. I'd give them a seven otherwise, but they're a little dry. Come on, babe. Just the fun part, which is all I can see now, cuz those are tips. So, call them just the tips. What are you doing? These are waffle cones filled with milk chocolate. Give us a shout on social media while enjoying just the fun part for a chance to be featured on our page. That could be huge for us. After all that fun talk, let's see if you actually capture the fun. At first, I was like, damn it, they did it. The sons of did it. But then I was like, hm, it's a waffle cone with some milk chocolate in it. First, I will say the milk chocolate is flavorless. I do I barely taste chocolate. It is a good texture because it's just hardened chocolate, but like barely any flavor. And second, kind of makes you realize maybe that part of the ice cream cone is so great because it's something that you work towards as you eat the entire ice cream cone. It's a little catharsis you get at the end. For them to just chop it off like a rhino horn and just sell it to you. Not only is there no romance to it, should be illegal. Like this is just a waffle cone with some really, really bland chocolate in it. It is also wildly undersulted and it shows. 15 mg of salt in two pieces. That is not much. This could really use some freaking salt. All that to be said, the waffle cone has a surprisingly great light crisp texture. The chocolate has a good texture. The flavor is just not there. I do think it kind of ruins just the fun part. Give it a four. [Music] Just the fun parts. Look at all my fun parts. Look at the fun parts. These are just the fun parts. That's all I get is the fun parts. Oh, I saw this at checkout and I said no. I will not go home without that. What we have here, folks, is dried mango dipped in spicy chocolate. I've never seen the scent spicy chocolate before. For the record, I think this sounds great. Maybe it's like a tajine kind of situation in white chocolate. Let's find out. For those who love a bold kick, #munch. Oh, Christ. That's the name of the company is #munch. That smells weird. Smells funny. Only half of it's dipped. Whoa. There's five ingredients. Ripe fresh mango, spicy chocolate, sugar, citric acid, sodium metabisulfite. Never heard that one. What if I'm allergic to one of these many dots that are in this spicy chocolate? Look at the number of dots, their colors. There's like two of them. Is that oregano? It does look like queso, doesn't it, Steve? Ripe fresh mango is very almost flavorless. I've never had dried mangoes so devoid of mango flavor. It's also been sweetened. Uh it's got that like sugar dust on the outside of it and then it's got this white chocolate on it. And when you eat that, that is all you taste. You got a little bit of heat on the back end. I can't really detect what these flavors are. It might just be cayenne or something. So, that sucks. I'm going to give it a four. I don't like it. Lot of fours today. Next up, a big jar of pickled asparagus. This used to be all they had at TJ Maxx Marshalls in the pantry area. They used to just only keep the fun snacks by the cash register and they would put like oil, some coffee, and this in the pantry area. It would be like and salt be like a whole bunch of different salt. Every color, mostly pink. Yeah. I'll tell you something, Steve. That is some not terrible pickled asparagus. Lightly crunchy. It's not fibrous at all. I'm not fighting to bite through it. Doesn't have any funny aftertaste. Sometimes pickled asparagus has this awful aftertaste. At least in my experience, a lot of dill flavor. If this were on a plate of antipasti, I'd be like, ""Oh, this is a lovely addition to this plate of antipasti."" Oh, let's be said, it's pickled asparagus, so I'm not going to give it like a great score, but I also kind of like it. I'm going to give it a six. Throw me the Give me all that stuff. This is all in French, so I don't understand it. Pure butter French shortbreads. These better be awesome. I better love these. Let's see. My Lucky Charms, 1888. First ingredient, flour. Second ingredient, butter. Sugar, eggs, egg yolk powder, caramel. Nothing gross. Nothing preservatively. Okay, so far so good. I love the look of them. They have a shiny top. That indicates to me that there's going to be a light crispness. That is about as light and crisp and buttery a shortbread as I've ever had. It definitely tastes shelf stable. Doesn't taste preserved. It doesn't taste like, you know, gross preservatives or anything. It just tastes like, you know, not fresh, which is fine. I think that's about the only way this could be better. As such, I'm going to give it a nine. I think it's a wonderful shortbread. What do you want? Wet snacks. Joe's candies. Yeah. With six pieces. How many did you have before? Five. I see why now. Six pieces. Folks, I never thought I'd say this, but there's too much chocolate on that graham cracker. Seriously, it needs more crunch. I want more crunch. I want more graham cracker. But maybe I'm just an old man. Okay, that's a chocolatecovered graham cracker. It's very whatever chocolate. There's a little bit too much of it, but it's still a chocolate covered graham cracker. The chocolate isn't good enough. No, it's good. I'll give it a seven. Chocolate covered graham cracker. David's Cookies. Double chocolate chip pecan meltaway. This is a very dated font. This box could be from 1995. Wow. It actually has comic sands on the back. Smart cookies agree. We're a bite above the rest, which is not a thing. Oh, not what I expected if I'm being honest. That is like a caricature of an old lady cookie. It's like barely sweet and it's got a really nice light texture. It's got the dusting of sugar on the outside. Hilariously dry with nuts in there. Dry cookie with nuts. Don't bust in my bag. They do kind of melt away. They're too dry. God, they're cravable, though. I could see eating a bunch of those. mostly because I'd want more flavor. I do love that the powdered sugar when it hits you, it's almost like a powdered sugar donut would taste cold for a second, you know, and then it does kind of melt, which creating that meltaway effect. The cookie itself is not melt away whatsoever. It's just very light and crisp. They're not bad, but they're also not very good. I'll give them a six. If you ever wondered what old lady cookies are like, ask David. All right, folks. Story time. Where's the tractor? $6.99. Felt flaps and a mirror also available. Where's the bigger? Where's the farmer? I don't see him. I see a rooster. Is he here? Oh, I see. Ah, here she is. Where's the combine harvester? You just went from one to 50. And where's the farmer? Where's the combine harvester? And where are you? Oh, there you are. And there you have it, folks. Five pages. I feel like that's short for any age. Like, if I'm trying to read a story to an infant, I'm like, what do I do now? I'm out of book. That was five. Was that even five pages long? How many? Where were there? 1 2 3 4 five. This felt a little low effort to me. Where's the Digger was a roller coaster compared to this. This is MCU phase five. Like this is not doing it for me. It's a three. This is a kids book. Salmon spread spread you some. $3.99. Compare at $5. Ooh. Usually I'm seeing this in those fancy French MREs. What are we dealing with here? Oh wow. That looks smooth. Uh, not as smooth a pate as I was hoping for. I can't tell if this is bad or if I just hate it. You're You're big into tinned fish. Can you try this? Oh, this looks like cat food. It does. It's so smooth on the top. Who hasn't Who hasn't tried cat food? Wow. For somebody who thought it looked like cat food, you had a huge bite of that. But not great. It's like no texture. It's just blended together. There is a bitterness to it. That was something I was Yeah, I don't really like that at all. So, we know it's not just my distaste for canned fish of any kind. I am verified in saying so because Nico loves tinned fish. Loves it. So, for him to not like this is got to be bad. Yeah. Let's give it a three. Iing hate it. Heavenly hunks. My birth name before I changed it to Andrewa Brownie. Brownie B. There's about the same amount of sugar in this as there were in those snack balls, but half of it's added, half of it's naturally there. So, you're getting roughly the same caloric sugar intake. It has the same texture that I kind of like. Again, the these are just the the chunks you get from the bulk aisle of of energy cubes. That's what these are. Has a decent natural chocolate flavor. It's dense, but it's got those oats in there bringing not a crunch, but a texture to it and and lending a little bit of tenderness. For a health food, it's pretty good. I don't know. I'm gonna give these a five. It's not like they're great and I want to keep housing them, but if I were craving something sweet or something brownie like and I couldn't have carbs or I couldn't have too much sugar or whatever, these would scratch the itch. So, I'll give them a five. Nails, but not the kind I know about, like construction stuff kind. Here's an interesting question. How do you get these off? Uh, this looks complicated, dude. I don't know. I don't want to do this anymore. Remove any nail polish. Check. There we go. We're figuring this out. Ow. Smells like uh creepy crawlers. Stick. Stick. Stick. Peel. Peel. Peel. [Applause] Go big or go home. Right. There we go. All right. It's pulling my nail. The nail is too small. So, it's arched and it's only stuck in the center. So, it's basically just pulling my nail up and it hurts and I don't like it. But do I love the way it looks? Kind of. Yeah. Wow. Very hard to imagine going through your day wearing five of these and attempting to perform even the most everyday of tasks. But that's not what I'm ranking, is it? Oh, the adhesive is dog. The he adhesive is really bad. And these feel fake. These feel fake. I don't know. I'll give these a five because I don't know. They're probably fine. All right. Chef Kim's rosé cheese. What the This Do you have the right amount of water? The only thing I do know is really tasty. Yeah, definitely too much water in here. If this was a thick sauce, good night. premixed sauce a little overflow, but I think you'll agree a little less watery. So, Nico looked it up and rosé Toki apparently is uh pretty close to a vodka sauce. It's a very light pink tomato sauce and it's highly delicious. It tastes really good. I can't really identify what's going on here. I think there's like dried basil, maybe some dried oregano, parmesan, like bottled parmesan. There's so much in here. It's insane. It's an instant snack. And it's really quite very good. It definitely tastes super fake, but like that's the point, right? This is a microwave snack. How much do I love it? Enough to give it a nine. Yes. I eat this whole bowl. Next up, we have some organic sweet matcha. A cafe style blend. Premium grade tea. It's got 9 g of added sugar per two teaspoons. No wonder it's not very green. I was about to say this is pretty pale. And I'll tell you why, folks. It's just matcha flavored sugar. That's sugar. You can see just has a little matcha in it. [Music] That was a bad mouth experience. That is a picture of matcha. That is not the actual product. This should not be legal. It doesn't dissolve easily. It's dumb. I don't like it. And it's uh free. I think I'm definitely muddied by that thing that happened. Let me try. Found another one. Homing beacon in my mouth. Red tractor protein creamy style oatmeal. Sun ripened. I know that they use the sun to grow, but ripen farmers in in the comments tell me, do you ripen oats? Do oats ripen? It's made in Australia for some reason and it's creamy style. What it is is instant oats, which I think might be what they're referring to because instant oats tend to be pretty creamy because they're really, really thin and processed and cook more quickly, so they turn into more of a mush. That tastes like plain oatmeal, not protein oatmeal. I don't taste protein. If I really look for it, maybe there's some like protein powder funk to it, but like for the most part, I just taste oats with a normal instant oat texture. That's pretty cool. I'll give it a six. It's sustenance with a little something extra. Next up, we have Girardelli Girardelli. Girardelli Girardelli mini bite-sized chocolate chip cookies. These look like those cookies you get in a bag from the vending machine. One of the few products that we've gotten today that doesn't have an airtight seal. This just has a piece of tape. This could have been opened. It's only taped on one side. These are so awful. Not only do they taste like tube cookie mix on steroids, they are stale as year old bread. They're both soft and hard at the same time. This the most stale stale tasting and stale feeling thing I've ever eaten. I hate them. I don't like that they just open from the back like this. They look awful and they bismerch a perfectly good American chocolate brand. I'm going to give these a two. Okay. Lindor birthday cake truffles. An as yet undiscovered flavor of Lindor. And these are white chocolate truffles with sprinkles, I assume. Wa! They smell like birthday cake. I'll tell you, it smells like I cracked open a can of birthday cake frosting. Oh, they don't look very birthday cake, Steve. Oh, they're just white. It's a white chocolate truffle with a ton of like faux vanilla flavor. That's why you get the birthday cake vibe. It does taste like birthday cake truffles. So, this begs the question, how dead am I inside? Do I like these or not? They taste really nice, but they're ugly. I'm going to give them a six. I would give them a seven cuz they taste like birthday cake frosting pretty much, but white chocolate. They still taste like white chocolate. That's my other problem. You can definitely taste white chocolate. And they just have no whimsy about them whatsoever. Very Swiss indeed. Girl Scouts cookies. We got Girl Scouts Thin Mint Snappers. These look like way better Thin Mints. Look at these versus those pucks. Those rations versus these snappers. Well, pretty accurate. It's delicious. The cookie bits taste like the Thin Mint cookie. I like Thin Mints. I would normally give Thin Mints. Personally, I'd give them a seven cuz I enjoy them, but nothing like Samoas. Nothing like that other one that I like that I can't remember. I'm going to give Samoas an honorary 10. And if normal Thin Mints get a seven, I think these get an eight. These are an improved Thin Mint. So, you don't have to give money to the Girl Scouts anymore. You can just give it to Mark, Edward Mark, a man. Dubai style chocolates. This so-called Dubai chocolate has been having a huge moment on social media and now annoyingly is everywhere. It all feels coordinated. In less than a year from this blowing up on TikTok, there were bars ready, like three different brands of bars ready at my local groceryer. And there were four different kinds of Dubai style chocolate at Marshalls. Maybe it's just really good. Let's find out. Question mark. It says OP on it. What the hell is that? That's not what I was led to believe. Dubai style chocolate is actual Dubai chocolate is filled with thin strips of filo that have been stripped and fried so you get these crunchy little bits. There's hardly little to none of that in here. It's mostly pistachio cream. I do not think that this is representative of what we've been seeing on our feeds. All that to be said is a standalone snack product. Tastes good. It's high quality milk chocolate and pistachio cream. It's not bad, but it's also not very good. And it's a huge letd down based off what you're what this is supposed to be and even the picture that looks at least like guacamole. But this that's not what it looks like at all. I'm going to give it a six. It's a perfectly pleasurable enough mouth object, but I'm not going to do anymore. One of my favorite things in this bad old world is those Brookfields chocolatecovered acai berry goo things. These are different. These are chocolate covered blueberries. They're very clearly trying to take something of that market share of the Brookfield. Oh, I just bought a bag of these like a couple months ago. It wasn't in a clear bag, and these look awful in a clear bag. They shouldn't have switched it. I also do remember these tasting like dirt. That they're using sweetened blueberries inside of chocolate is hilarious because it tastes sour and bitter and then a little bit dirty. I still kind of like it in a gross private way. Too many shortcomings. It is tart. It is bitter. The chocolate is really high quality, but it's bitter. I think the dirt flavor is gone. Actually, it's just sour and bitter. That's an improvement, but not much. So, I'm going to give this a five. These are kind of not where they need to be. Let's get some shrooms in me. Who's ready to trip? Okay, we have Cortiseps mushrooms daily gummies. Mango and pineapple flavored. Uh, they don't taste bad. They have a terrible texture. It's gritty. That being said, they're vitamin gummies. So, six. They taste good. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hey taste good. And gummy vitamins can have textures and flavor, whatever. Sienna RT made in Italy from an old Italian family recipe. Homemade style potato. Definitely not homemade. This has always wigged me out. Room temperature. I know it's a thing and I've had it before and it's fine, but it just it's weird. Oh, it smells bad. They're not going to taste that way. I I bet they're not going to taste that way. There's they probably have some preservative at room temperature, whatever, that's going to boil off or something. It smells like dog and crayons. It smell It smells insane. And this is going to be a rare double review because we have fresh pasta that we're going to cook and we need some sauce. So, we got some of your mama's sauce, you loser. Okay. Wow. What is this? Homemade meal. The sauce is gross. It's raw tasting, which normally I like. It tastes too processed. Like a more sour tombstone. Like it tastes like tombstone sauce packets from Lunchables if you added citric acid to it. Like no, these are extremely soft. Luckily, they don't have any of that horrible smell that they were accompanied by in the package. They're way too soft. They don't have any density to them. Uh, and I only cooked them for the specified amount of time. And the sauce is childlike, but not as sweet. So, it's not childlike. It's just your mama's sauce. More like your your dad's sauce. Has a neutral flavor with a bad texture. I'm going to give it a four. It is just below acceptable. And the sauce is Let me try a little bit on its own just in case. Yeah. No. Bitter, but also like that sickly kind of sweet of overcooked, overprocessed tomatoes and and um preservatives. I'm going to give that sauce a four as well. It's a pair of fours here. Global Brands Little Bear Blend Syrup. You'll notice that it doesn't say the word honey on there. Oh man, it has got a dense texture to it. It's hard to push your spoon into. Am I right, fellas? I think there could be as little as almost no honey in there. That tastes almost like nothing. Just sweet. And then you got this little bit of honey flavor in there right at the end. Just barely. It's got this awful like sticky texture. It is just corn syrup with a tiny wee bit of honey in there to make you think," """"Oh"," this must be honey."""" Look", it's in a bear. This is disgusting in that it's mostly just corn syrup and you don't just go around eating corn syrup, do you? I'm going to give it a two. I don't care for any part of this. Okay. Kinders premium quality established 1946 barbecue sauce. I do like the squirt bottle. That is a good idea. I also like the branding. It's kind of cool looking. I would be proud to put this on my patio. It's just really average barbecue sauce. $6.99 for This looks like you're getting more than your typical barbecue sauce bottle, but I also have no idea. Yeah, it's nothing remarkable. It's not bad either. I'll give it a give it a six. It's like slightly better than KC Masterpiece. That's a six. Hypergeear active noise cancelling headphones. Silence never sounded so good. And these are very clearly designed to be knockoffs of Sony noise cancelling headphones. These look exactly like them without noise cancelling on. They have very strong sound isolation. So like I can't hear you super well right now with the noise cancelling off. It sounds like canny like you're, you know, hollow almost. But I kind of can't believe how good the noise cancelling is for 20 bucks. I guess technologies come a long way. All right. They sound like they sound like skull candy but over your ears. All that to be said, for $20, if you're looking for noise cancelling headphones to take on your next plane trip, 20 bucks, that's pretty incredible. It's not great, but like I just can't believe that there there are even noise cancelling headphones for $20, much less ones that actually work. The sound is  but again, noise cancelling is good. Even six, even if you're just using them, take a nap, they're relatively comfortable. Can't believe they're $20. Well, there you have it, folks. a smattering of 37 different products from mostly Marshalls because Marshalls and TJ Maxx have the same stuff. So, what do we learn? There's some decent snacking to be had in the snack aisle of TJ Maxx, Marshalls, and HomeGoods. There are some misfires. You know, we got some startup companies that maybe didn't sell so well and ended up in the store, but we have also got some overlooked gems. This was a pretty interesting episode for me to film because I did not know that there were so many things. We must have only gotten 15% of what they had there. There was so much stuff. Thank you so much for watching. Please let me know in the comments what snacks did I miss from Marshalls, TJ Maxx, and HomeGoods. What are your favorites? What do you want to see me rank next on this show? And what's going on with you? And remember, whether you're a Marshallista. And remember, whether you're a Maxinista or a Marshall Mats," we're all passengers on the same gravy boat.

hIb39ouzbvw,"It's got bald patches. It's mangy. There's nothing this bright and colorful in my life. Oh, no. I don't like this. Do you like this? I don't use this word often. I don't say it lightly. That's ice creamtastic. Mr. Softy, what' you call me? It's the place where you get ice cream from a truck. From a stranger. Well, which ones do you get? How do you know which ones are good?

Basically, we got a chocolate dip. We got some sprinkles on soft serve. I'm eating this with a spoon like a weirdo because I want to be able to save it for my compatriots to eat. Let's see what's going on here. Has soft serve gotten softer since I last soft served? Cuz that's soft. The soft serve feels artificially thickened. It feels like they're putting stabilizers in there to make it creamier and not melt as quickly. And I think a sacrifice texture. Then the chocolate dip really adds like zero flavor. It's mostly just texture. Same with the sprinkles. All that to be said, look at it. It's amazing. Give it an eight. If I dare you to eat this without a smile, cherry dip. It's exactly what it sounds like. It's vanilla soft serve with a cherry dip. I don't like artificial cherry, and I don't really like vanilla ice cream, but together it works really nice. I don't like it as much as the chocolate with the sprinkles, though. That's a really artificial cherry flavor. Tastes like cough syrup, but it's still kind of good. I'll give it a six. That's fine. That's fine. It's a six. I don't like that. I don't like this. You like this? I don't like it. Why is it wobbly? Ice cream shouldn't be wobbly. There's definitely stabilizers in there that are keeping it fluffy. God, that cookie crunch is great. The ice cream on its own is not chocolatey enough. And I don't like the way that it's it's it's been fluffed like that. Like, I hate that it jiggles. Soft serve shouldn't jiggle like that. It's weird. I love the cookie crunch. Ice cream on its own. Another seven with the cookie crunch. I'll give it an eight. I'm unsettled, but it's still good. Now we have a pineapple vanilla in a waffle cone. I like it, but it's gross. [Music] He's smiling laugh. [Music] It's just like canned pineapple if you added a lot of sugar to it and thickened it with zanthan gum. All that to be said, I still like it. All that to be said, I still like it. Give it an eight. I like it. It's really gross, but I really like it. All right, we're back in the studio. So, we ate the soft serve on site because it's not transportable, though. It is jiggable, which was unsettling. And we've picked up all the pops we could pack into our parcel of We got We got all the pops, one of each. First up, strawberry shortcake. This was my go-to. This and the chocolate version of this. Oh, the these pebbles bigger than they used to be. Steve nodded. Yes. Steve has much better eyesight than I do. That I feel like these these pebbles pop uh rocks. These crunchies. What are they? How are you described? Frozen strawberry shortcake dessert bar. America's favorite strawberry shortcake bar asterisk. You can't asterisk and then not point to an asterisk. You can't do it right legally. Based on unit sales 52 weeks ending September 8th, 2024. That is an incredible level of specificity and I respect that in an ice cream bar. That's awful. A little bit of crunch. This is way better than I remember it being. Also, I remember there being like a a vanilla layer, but everything's pink. There's pink and red, just like me. If you open me up, took a bite. And there's a little bit of crunch left in the crunchies, and it's a wonderful, delightful thing to eat. It makes me feel like I'm a child again. It has a sharper strawberry flavor than it used to. And uh the texture's great, looks great. It can throw, it can pitch, it can hit. It's a very rare combination of features, and it might just be an all-star one day. So, I'm enough quoting Moneyball. I'm going to give this an eight. I love it. I shouldn't have given such high scores. I take back all the scores I gave outside. Drop them all by a point. It was too weird that that ice cream was whipped into a foam and that it jiggled. You shouldn't be able to jiggle soft serve that way. Oh, thank God. Eight. I think this is eight. Eight is more than fair. I think it's generous even. Next up, we have Hagandas chocolate dark chocolate. That's small. Is that small? Feels small. 270 calories in this littleer. That's tiny. Damn, that's good. The chocolate in ice cream, like the little bits of chocolate, to me tastes like the best chocolate in the world. Might be because it's cold. Might be because it's surrounded by frozen sweetened dairy. I don't know. It also kind of tastes like Hershey's Special Dark. Disaster. The chocolate could be much higher quality. The ice cream could taste chocolateier, but I love it at the the same amount as that strawberry shortcake. So, let's go an eight on this. I'm being I'm being really generous today. Eight. Bomb pop. Blow yourself up with flavor. I hope that blue is what's on top. Damn it. Blues last. This would That's why I hated this cuz I hate cherry and you have to eat through cherry just to get the sweet delicious blue. Look how much red. Look how much cherry. Look at that. It looks like a diseased c. What? There's only one way to get to the white. Anyway, softer than I had imagined. What's that famous white ice flavor? I think it's lemon. I think that's lemon. But look at exactly where it split. Now you just got your ging 10. The lemon is okay. The blue is not as good as I remember it being. It's like worse than blue raspberry. I am not a big cherry guy. I'm trying to not let that swimming, but there it sits before me dripping. I'm going to give it a five. I'm going to give it a five. I need it. Good humor. Cookies and cream. It's got bald patches. It's mangy. This straight. Look at that. Look at the difference. Everyone has to see. What is this? And no, there's no bits in the back. If I had my eyes closed, I would tell you that was a vanilla bar that tastes nothing of chocolate. What a horrible thing to have to look at. You eat with your eyes first. It's so ugly. I'm going to give it a three. I mean, I'd eat this, I guess, but I'd be so disappointed. Sonic the Hedge style hog. Sonic the Hog. Gumball eyes artificially flavored blue raspberry and cherry. It's cool that it's not movie Sonic. Now, I don't have anything against movie Sonic. The first movie I think is an American masterpiece. But what's it going to look like? Oh, that's better than I was expecting. Honestly, I was expecting a disaster. It's identifiable, though. I think if you saw that no context, you'd be like, ""What the is wrong with that Sonic gumball ass?"" All right, I'm going to try biting into a frozen gumball. I'll see you at the dentist. That tastes like a toddler's iPad. Why would you put gumballs in a frozen treat? I really don't like the way it tastes. It's got to be just for very young children who just only know what sweet is. And you know, all their teeth are going to fall out anyway. They're going to, you know, baby teeth. So you can chew on this frozen gumball all day. I hate it. So give it a two. You only I'm only even giving it a two because it's recognizable as Sonic. Snickers ice cream bar. One of God's very few gifts. I remember when they when they invented these. I was there and I said to them, ""Boys, we're going to make a whole lot of money and they stole everything from me."" Ah, yes. Damn it. Do I love it? 10. No notes. Perfect. Amazing food item. Starburst strawberry sorbet bar. Please tell me is it is it in a square [Music] tariffs? It is a whopping 70 calories. This tastes like a strawberry Starburst. It's going to be good. That tastes exactly like a strawberry Starburst and I don't like it. That tastes weird. It just It tastes like there's a Starburst wrapper in it. Like it's it tastes wax papery. The strawberry flavor is so aggressively fake. It works in a Starburst medium, but in a pop, this is just like who did this? It's so small. It doesn't taste right. Give it a three. It's got a good texture, but I'll give it a three for everything else. Nestle Tolas chocolate chip cookie sandwich. This feels liquid. Oh no. [Applause] Presumably this melted in the truck or something and they were like, ""Ah, it kids."" Yeah, I'll use a knife. I don't care. I'm gonna try to rank it as I know it would be. Just going to keep with it. Yeah, it just tastes like melted tubed cookie dough. I'm going give it a three. I don't even taste chocolate or cookie for that matter. Vanilla milk chocolate almond. Not a fan of their vanilla ice cream, but am I a fan of their milk chocolate almond? That tastes like a grocery store. Like the way a grocery store smells criminally boring. I don't even know why the almonds are in there for looks. I don't like it terribly much. And I think it deserves no better than a four. There's an off flavor. And it was in a sealed container. Oh, I found the flavor. It's the almonds. Almonds taste off and not even in like a turned way and like they taste like a grocery store. I don't like that ppg. I don't know. Powerpuff Girls. What are they called? With gumball eyes. The door mine doggy door. Oh, I got this one. I got that one. Buttercup. I got Buttercup. Whoa. She looks not well. No, it's not Buttercup. Sorry. Bubbles. Bubbles. She looks not well. Um, very raccoon features. What are the flavors to be expected here? Cherry again with your cherry, water, sugar, corn syrup, and that's it. Except for ready natural and artificial flavors, citric acid, guard gum, zanthan gum, modified cellulose, cellulose, gel, yellow six, blue, two leg, red 40, blue one by 40, yellow five, gumball, hard wax. That's the you put on your car. NUBA plus gumball eyes. Same exact manufacturer as Sonic. I mean, I'm gonna try the gumball because I don't want to risk my teeth again. All right, fine. I'll eat her eye out. I'm gonna turn this one into gum. That's all the gum you get out of gumball. Oh, those are her eyes. I forgot their eyes are big black balls with little white. Doesn't look like that, though. It looks like she's got just huge amounts of of uh eyes shadow on. I really don't like any aspect of it. I'm going to give it a two. This sucks and it's awful and I hate it. Oreo bites, 14 pieces. A cool new way to enjoy Oreo. Popable bites dipped in a delicious Oreo coating. Is this Oreo coating? What about its Oreo? I don't use this word often. I don't say it light lightly. That's ice creamtastic. It's got this extremely subtle crunch to it. Almost like a sugar crunch, like if there was just loose sugar in there. It's got that very small granular crunch. And it's just a perfect If you like cookies and cream, this is your Apex Predator right here. or the No, because you wouldn't want that, would you? This This is your prey. The best part about this ice cream treat is that you can throw it at your friend's mouths and see if they can catch. This is not going to work out. Here we go. Oh, that boy can catch in his mouth. I'll give it an eight. Is delightful. It's also little popable pops. That one did. Did you see that? It did like a waiver at the end. Crunch. Crunch. Vanilla bar with crunch coating. I like to suck my chocolate and putting in it makes me chew it. I don't want a bunch of soggy crunchies at the end of my sucking. First off, not enough crunchies. Also, it tastes stale. It tastes expired. It tastes turnt. Give it a four. It's gross. I don't like it. It's not my prejudice against crunch. It's my taste buds and my eyes and ears. Frozen fruit bar. Strawberry made with chunks of real fruit. I love whole fruit bars, Babage fam. Delightful. Tastes like whole fruits. First ingredient, strawberries. If I were gluten intolerant, lactose intolerant, cholesterol intolerant, I'd be jumping jacks. I'd be jumping for jacks. I love like whole fruit strawberry bars especially because there like the seeds. You get the little seeds in there. And sure, this tastes healthy, but it's not. I'd be a fool to give it less than an eight. I really like it. Tastes very natural. It tastes like I'm making a healthy decision that will ripple out into the rest of my week. But it's Friday, so bring me some ice cream. Oh, chocolate eclair. That's what it was called. Now there's a reason to get out of bed in the morning. They still make chocolate aclair bars and they still are absolutely stacked with nubbins. Why can't they do this with the chocolate crunch bar? They're putting all their dumping all their resources into a Claire's and strawberry shortcakes. Rightfully so. Why would you get a chocolate crunch bar when you get a a Claire? I want it to be a fudgeicle with crunchies on top. That's what I want. But instead, it kind of tastes like Hershey's chocolate syrup. Texture is great. Just like the strawberry shortcake. A little bit of crunch. Nice and soft. Two layers of color. It's probably the vanilla that dampens the experience. It's probably mixing with it and giving me that Hershey's syrup flavor. I don't like it nearly as much as the strawberry shortcake. That tasted fake, but at least it was having fun. Four. I don't like it. I don't want to eat any more of it. Too fake a chocolate flavor. Wa! Mango with spicy chili. Oh, call the doctor. I think I need medical assistance. And it looks like it has one of my new favorite things in the world on it. Chammoy, a h spicy fruit sauce. Oh, that smells good. H. Oh, that is hard as a rock. Ah. Oh, but it's delicious. Is that real fruit? How spicy is it? Very little. But I've never had a spicy frozen bar. Chammoy sauce. They put the actual sauce in here. There's too much water in here. You're not putting anything in here to soften it. I'm sure that there are perfectly safe industrial chemicals that will make this soft as a soft ice cream bar. God, I wish this had a good texture. It's delicious. It tastes like real mango because it is. Tastes like real chamoy because it is. But that texture is terrible. Maybe sucking on it. For that texture alone, I'm going to give it a seven. If it did not have that texture, I'd give it a nine. It's delicious. M&M's. This one I was not looking forward to because lo and behold, there are M andM in the cookie. And these are probably going to be hard. Oh, my shorts are short right now. That M&M tastes inbred. Oh. Oh god. Look. Not only is the is the cookie coming off, the color is coming off. What a disaster. Look at how horrible I am. That M&M tasted awful. What's going on with the rest of this? It's grainy. It doesn't taste that bad. Yeah. But then the fake M&M, whatever that is, comes in. And it's the messiest ice cream stand. Barely touched it. Let me see how quickly I can touch it and still get some on me. Haha. How quickly can you eat this sandwich? It tastes like I took boxed brownie mix, mixed it with water, and froze it. If that's your thing, then this one's for you. I think this is one of the worst frozen dairy products I've had to eat. Uh, I'm going to give it a one. Still tastes like human food, so that's why it's not getting a zero or double zero or triple zero, which are things now. It's really bad. Cocoa. I love coconut ice cream. Conma. Is this dairy based? Ingredients: milk cream. Water. All right. So, this should be much better texture. Small incision. Why is that? It's glued. Take a page out of Hogen Daz's book. Puff some air in there. That tastes natural for the most part. This is fruit and dairy. Yeah, coconut's a fruit. Is it? Yes. I chew my ice cream. Especially when there's bits of coconut in it. I'm a sucker for coconut ice cream. We just had What do What do you call that? Street cream. That's what they called me in high school and college and this morning on the street. My dad calls me that now. I wish it were a little less icy, but I'd demolish this thing. I'm going to give it a nine. I love it. It tastes like coconut and dairy. It's so good. Uh-oh. Crunchy cookies. Oh, I have an embarrassing confession to make. Babish fam. I've never had a Twix ice cream bar before. And I did not know that there was cookies in it. And I was ready to complain. Oh god, I wish there was just a channel of cookie in the bottom, just like in the real world. But there's just chunks of it. Small chunks. And that's not enough. Okay, a lion has roared. It tastes better than the Snickers bar, but it's smaller and doesn't have as good of a texture because I want more of that cookie. No, it's so good. It's so good. I would I'm sick of ice cream. I've had more ice cream today than I've ever had in my life. Not even as a child. That can't be true. My parents would leave me alone sometimes. What do I do with you? And I think if you put a cookie in there, it' be a 10. I'm going give it a nine. I have to leave room for improvement. There's enough ice cream with Sawyer. What? I What? This isn't even a real one. I don't know if this is going to be viable, Babish fam. Oh my god. Sorry. There you go. Oh my god. There you go. You happy? You like this? Look at this pre-moon landing couple of kids. Those are some old kids. It's a beautiful thing to look at. I'm looking at on the monitor. I'm like, I can see there's nothing this bright and colorful in my life. Look at how goth my kitchen is by comparison. It looks like a sci-fi movie from Hades. It's been a long time since I had a snow cone. I forgot that it's like rocks of ice, like big ice cubes in there. You can see there's gigantic pebbles of ice in there over which a syrup of tropical cooler has been If you have to apply some pressure when you're shoving your teeth into it cuz it's hard as a rock and then as soon as you release it's like I'm so sorry. Careful. Whats fine. What? I'm just going to hold it. All right. Uh, is there any difference in flavor? They are different flavors. Bad ones. Um, and it's so hard. I don't think you could chew that if you would even want to chew ice like that. I know I chopped it in half easily enough, but I'm sorry. I don't like this very much. And as such, no, it's it's ridiculous. I'm gonna give it two. Bad flavor, bad texture. Looks ridiculous. The big guns. Spongebob Squarepants. Fruit punch and cotton candy with chocolatey eyes. Oh man. Wait a minute. Sponge has blue eyes. What's up with these chocolatey eyes? his blue eyes. This is going to look like a like a demon compared to What's it going to look like? I want to see before you. That's not great. But it's not as bad as I thought it was going to be. I thought it was going to be because if they centered those eyes, it would be looking through you. I think that's why they offset him and look over here cuz they're like when people look these directly in the eyes, they don't got no soul no more. And then this happens. Oh no. Spongebob, where are your eyes? What part is cotton candy and what part is fruit punch? This is terrible. Cuz I like cotton candy. Fake cotton candy flavor. I don't like fruit punch. What the I've never had a texture like that. It feels insane in the mouth. Not only the flavor, which kind of burns. It's like the most powerful fruit punch ever devised. I was talking about the soft serve in the park being like bouncy and fluffy and and foamy. Uh, and this just takes that to an entirely new level. The only thing that gives this away as ice cream is that it's cold now. Chocolatey eyes. [Music] It's right in the center. I didn't notice the heads in the center. It's very funny that they chose to list that as a feature because it was about 0.001 g of chocolate. Take a look at how much chocolate we're we're talking about here. That's how much that's not a feature. Cocoa is the second to last ingredient after locust bean gum. That's how much chocolate is in this thing. All right. Is this cotton candy down below? Oh, yeah. You can't eat this as a child and grow up. Okay, this is too many flavors for you. It's too much stimulation. This is the tick tock of ice cream bars. Like, you shouldn't give this to a child. That um cotton candy flavor tastes exactly like bubble yum with the duck on it with the mohawk cotton candy. Remember that? And he's got a nose ring. It's too strong. It's horrible to look at, horrible to taste. Insane texture. I deeply dislike it. Every aspect of it. And you know what that means? Zero. [Music] Look, I love Spongebob seasons 1 through three. Watch any episode after season 3 and tell me that it's even remotely close to what the the the the explosion of creativity that we're seasons one through three. Giant vanilla. Giant vanilla. It can't even f fit this space between my four fingers. Nothing that can fit in this space should be called giant. But let me tell you what's about to happen, folks. I'm going to hold this for 5 seconds. This is an oldfashioned ice cream sandwich. I think which this is where we figure out how jaded I am. Just how far have I fallen from a childlike state of wonder and fun? because it is an this is a dictionary definition ice cream sandwich. What does that mean to me? I guess I've I've I've seen one too many episodes of Hannity. I guess I've seen one too many modern David Atenboroough documentaries because I'm jaded. I'm tired. I'm scared. I watch those and I'm like, ""Oh, everything's dying. It's my fault."" So, with that in mind, I'm going to give this a six. It is nice enough to eat and I eat the whole thing, but it's pretty standard. It's uninteresting and uh it's messy and it's it's kind of boring, but it's ice cream. It's an ice cream sandwich. Like, shut up. Six. Six. Frozen dairy vanilla dessert sandwich. Dessert sandwich is good. The first time I've ever heard that. I'm taking that and I'm putting it right here in my pocket. Ice cream. What did we learn? Candy bars make the best ice cream. Candy bars make the best ice cream. Sprinters make the best bobs letters. I'm very happy that came to me so quickly. But I do have cool running memorized. So, what do we learn today? Ice cream can be good, but it's not going to live up to your childhood expectations because nothing will. Everything was better when you were a child. Your brain was pumping endorphins and and dopamine. All the colors were brighter. Everything was better and it felt better. So don't Come on. Life's good. You don't have to like they're killing my childhood. No, your childhood's dead and so will you be one day cuz death's coming. So what are you going to do till then? Are you going to hide or you going to get out there and have some ice cream? I think you know what the the right answer to what you should do. Should hide. Thank you guys so much for watching. Please let me know in the comments. What is your favorite ice cream from an ice cream truck? Which ice creams did I miss? What do you want to see me rank next on this show? Thank you so much for watching. Again, I know I already said it, but I mean it two times. Double dip, if you will. Not that that was anything. It sounds like ice cream, right? Double dip. Mhm. No, that's what you do at a party when you double dip. Happy ice cream. Thanks again to my long-term partner Squarespace for sponsoring this episode.

uvPCqceqW0c,"What about an Italian fried rice? Is that appropriation? Is that appropriative? Is that appropriate? Some carrots and celery. Garlic. Lots of it. We need a big old onion.

00_HlYma2Qg,"Give me a kit. Give me a cat. Give me a Kit Kat. Kit Kat. Kit. Give me a piece. Give me a piece. Give me a piece of that candy bar. Oh, that's good. Kit Kats. 1935 it was introduced as Round Tree Chocolate Crisp, which actually sounds kind of nice. 1937 name changed to Kit Kat Chocolate Crisp. In the '7s, uh Kit Kat was introduced to Japan. And since then, there are now 300 different flavors and varieties of Kit Kat available regionally. Often gift giving is a big part of travel in Japan. So getting regional Kit Kat flavors, bringing them home. And coincidentally, Kit Kat sounds a lot like kitosu. So in Japanese, kito katsu means surely win or definitely succeed. So, they've become good luck charms in Japanese culture, which is why these small individually sized ones often come with a little little bit of penmanship opportunity on the back where you can write a little wish of good luck, usually to students taking important tests and stuff like that. Pretty cool if you ask me. So that closeness in translation is in some ways the opposite of the Chevy Nova, which when they attempted to sell in Mexico, you might find that the word Nova means no go. Not a great name for a car Chevrolet. So there's over 300 different Kit Kat flavors. We were only able to procure about 33 on this hallowed day. So that's what we're going to do. And if you want to see more in the future, you comment below and tell me so. And I will go. A big thank you to Cook Unity for sponsoring this episode.

All right, first up we have an individual awfully fun size Kit Kat with the most detailed instructions I've ever seen on a piece of food so small. Not labeled for individual sale obviously. To open, lift, flap, and tear at end. All caps, making sure you know the proper way to open this. But then you look and you see that the ends are also tooththed, so for easy tearing, which runs contrary to the instructions. So, why are those there? We're asking the big questions. I'm doing it the right way. Should be like their marketing campaign. Like, um, Twix is like, ""Do you like right Twix or left Twix?"" Kit Kats, would you like to open it the right way or the wrong way? A wagging my finger in approval for the little ones. Because here's the deal. I was like, hm, there's extra chocolate on this Kit Kat. No, there's just two ends very, very close together, and there's always extra chocolate on the ends. So, I have so many of these to eat. Shouldn't have done that. It means that there's more chocolate because it's small. We were going to do the three different sizes as a joke, but now I think there might be legitimacy to it. Does this get a higher score because of the higher chocolate ratio? Uh, no, because well, h I want it to, but I can't give it an eight. That's insane. I'm going to give this I can't give things point scores. We decided that's too hard for our graphics guys. It's why we stopped doing it. But I'm gonna give this a 7.1 because I think that it it it slightly elevated the experience. Moving on to regularsized Kit Kat. You'll notice the calorie count in the lower right hand corner. 210 versus 160 despite the change in size. That's because this is 210 calories per package. This 160 per serving. So basically, maybe even just on a subconscious level, you might see these numbers and think that somehow, you know, oh, it's this 160 calorie dessert. That sounds pretty good. And you might end up eating more because it's a big old god thing. So, I think that should be illegal. Oh, something else interesting. We'll get into that later. Not yet. One KitKat at a time. Unless you're one of those people that eats two at a time, in which case, whatever. Do do what you like. I don't care. You thought I was going to be like you. That's the same thing. Same exact thing. It's going to get a seven. Was your hypothesis correct about the extra chocolate then? >> Extra chocolate. Oh no, I only had the NP. Steve, you're trying to make me eat more Kit Kat. >> Okay, it's negligible. But it's non zero.1. Yeah. >> 0.1 is non zero. >> There you go. >> All right. Oh, different different formatting on this one. Straight line. And then on the big boy, we got two we have a line break. We have two lines, but same capitalization schema. Yeah, the packaging is twice as thick at least. You can see how much more rigid this is. I'm applying exactly the same amount of force down to a very precise degree. This has got to be twice as thick. Wait a minute. What the? These are different. They have different text on them. Are they a different size? Oh my god, they're slightly different size. You thought you were just getting more of the same bars? You were an idiot. No, this is different. See how different? Wake up. It's like listening to the lamest stream media and look at your Kit Kat. Okay, maybe I was imagining it. I thought these were different form form factor. >> I think they're about the same, but bewilderingly, the type face is different. King size is bigger and the kerning is wider means there's more space in between each letter and there's a space between kit and cat as opposed to the normal size where you'll see that there is no space between kit and cat. Why is there space? Why is there there's a there's pl me that's not a space. Is this a knockoff? Did we get an impostor Kit Kat? The packaging has no space as Steve so astutely pointed out. I think I've just stumbled upon a massive conspiracy to defraud the American public. Wow, >> fascinating. That's the same. I don't like the logo as much, so I'm gonna give it a 6.9. I'm kidding. >> Thank you for calling the Hershey Company, where our goal is to help you make more moments of goodness. >> Hello. Thank you for contacting the Hershey Company. >> Sometimes I'm looking at Kit Kat bars, and sometimes there's a space between kit and cat. Sometimes it's one word. Do you have any idea why that is? You think I have fake Kit Kats? Cuz the the one with the space on it? >> That depends on the size. I'm afraid the king size will have a little space. The regular wouldn't have it. Uh but yeah, the original version doesn't present one. So, I'm afraid that could be a well like a packaging issue because there is no space. Uh the same way you want to with the lab number that the product has, I can send it over with the manufacturing plan and they can review it. >> Yeah. No, I think um I think we've gotten to the bottom of this. Thank you so much for indulging my curiosity. I hope you have a wonderful day and thank you for your help. Next up, Kit Kat white chocolate. Sorry. Just wait. No, it is just Kit Kat white. I was joking. It's just Kit Kat white in 2025. At least appropriately. It's gross. That's good. That's progressive. Proud profer of white chocolate. Whoa. Whoa, people. Okay, we got a space. We have a space on the bar, but not on the package. Got to call our friend back. I don't know if this is chocolate. Contains 2% or less of chocolate. Just white. We got a space on the bar, not on the package. I like that less. Just cuz I like it less, does that mean it gets a lower score? Yes. I'm going to give it a five. I'm not crazy about it. Uh, it doesn't even have the white chocolate, but I just It just tastes nondescript. tastes white and as such it will get a five cuz we're a real mixed bag folks. KitKat vanilla which what's the difference? Wait, hold the on. Sideby-side comparison ingredients: sugar. Sugar vegetable oil. Vegetable oil. What the actual? This white Kit Kat has vanilla in it, which is artificial vanilla flavor. This vanilla Kit Kat has none at all. Has no vanilla in flavor. It says artificial flavor in there in the same way this says artificial flavor. Huh? Let's see if it's literally any different. If they're just selling the exact same Is that illegal? Should we call them cops? Different type. Different a mother type. Space. No space. Space. No space. Other than that, looks identical in color and vibrancy. That just tastes like white. This tastes like vanilla. This tastes like a vanilla wafer. It's not my cup of tea. I do like it better than that. So, I think by proxy, I have to give it a six. It's It's a five for me cuz I don't like it, but I think that it is an improvement. Next up, we have KitKat Chocolate Frosted Donut. Let's open it correctly. Per the package instructions. Oh. Oh my. It's two-tone. Like a like a Rolls-Royce. I want it to be cinnamon. Isn't there cinnamon Kit Kat? Wo. Smells like more chocolatey. Like more artificial chocolatey flavor. Wow. Speaking of wow, I got a real wow for you. This is the best day of my life. The bar on the packaging, though it's be broken between the words kit and cat, is indeed the unspaced version. I can tell from the type face and having seen unspaced versions in my day. >> Do you see how the K is much bigger than the rest of the type face? It doesn't match on the the graphic of the bar. There is no it's the no space logo. But on the bar itself, space back to the eating of it. This has a more artificial like a stronger artificial chocolate flavor. End of the day, I don't like it as much. I like it better visually, but not bad. I'm gonna give these a six. These are fine. Next up, we have all the little entrons from Japan that we had special order and that are probably a little bit melted because it's hot outside. Where the hell do I start? I think with the ones that I think are just Kit Kats. Let's get that Google Translate app up and running. Kit works great now. Kit works fine. Kit works fine. Kit works great. It keeps going back and forth. Kit works fine. And then it sees the exclamation point. It's like, no, never mind. Kit works great. And as you can see, there is the little space to write a personalized good luck, best wishes, or sure success sentiments. I can't wait to see the logo situation on this Oh, see, I did it the wrong way and it's a disaster. Oh, there we go. Oh, yeah. These definitely got a little bit melted to the point where I can't see the logo. Blanks. Okay, let's keep our fingers crossed. Okay. I mean, I can't cuz I'm using them, but you know. Oh. H. Okay. Hang on. I'm glad I tried this. The chocolate is of a higher quality. It's more like a Cadbury Milk chocolate. As such, it tastes better. Do I give it an eight? I think I like it more. It's saltier, too. It has like a salty hit to it. I think it's an improvement on the Kit Kat format. And I'm going to give it an eight. We got a ghost on here. Is this ghost? Is this the ghost I've heard so much about? Apple pie is >> wa >> apple pie with a ghost. And the ghost is saying thank you. And the Batman logo's on the back. A very off-brand Batman logo. Is that something you say at Halloween in Japan? Thank you. Is apple pie a central fixture to Halloween? I have so many questions. Oh, what does this say? Let's eat the kit. [Laughter] I really want to know what its thought process was in that. Let's eat the kit. I'm gonna take that that advice. I'm praying this is apple pie. If it's not, I'm gonna be really confused. Wow. Orange is the days long. One day I'm going to get a logo. I would have guessed this was orange creamsicle, but no. It smells like Halloween. Wa. That's insane. That's insane. That's insane. It tastes not like apple pie, but like an apple pie scented candle, which I don't think is that bad. I wouldn't want one in my house. But when I smell it, I'm not like, ""How dare you have lit that Yankee candle in here?"" I'm polite. I keep it to myself. But now that I'm saying that, it's I don't think I like it very much. It does taste like kind of like a candle shop. There is cinnamon to it and there's a tartness to it. They're like put probably putting like citric acid in there or something to simulate the tartness of an apple. It's absurd. It tastes exactly like a candle. Give it an oddball five. Kit Kat apple pie. Maybe there aren't as many dupes in here as we thought. All right, let's try to keep it basic before we get into the wild ones. This This guy could be matcha. Could be chocolate. Could be matcha chocolate. I have a feeling it's going to be a normal Kit Kat because this looks like it's just one of those little messages of good luck or eat this kit can be surpassed. I'd love for somebody to tell us what this actually means. Can you comment below what the hell this means? It's all luck based. So, I assume that maybe it's a pun. It's like a pun that we cannot understand cuz we don't speak the language. That sure looks normal. Wait. Nope. Nope. That's a chocolate matcha. I'm stunned that the only indicator that this is chocolate matcha is the green on the packaging. I don't see anything here that says well I can't speak the language but the back is just like a simple instruction. Just put the kitten. That's very weird to me that that they don't they don't say the name of the flavor on the package. You just know it from the color. Must just be so ubiquitous that everybody knows. Chocolate matcha. Two flavors I would not have thought to combine with good reason. kind of just tastes like seaweed chocolate, which I'm sure some freak out there loves. I don't care for that flavor combination not much at all. It's cuz matcha on its own is nice. I like it. Sweet matcha is great, but with chocolate, it almost makes it taste dirty, like too grassy uh or seaweedy or something. So, I'm not a fan of that. I'm going to bring this down to a four. It's not for me. This to me looks like it's going to be straight matcha by virtue of its greenness. This one, two. This one, three. Well, who knows? This Oh, this one has a totally different vibe. These are all strong matcha. Let's see if they look any different. Oh, I can see some logo. And wow, that's interesting. Now, not only is the ellipsus the border of the type, but the bar is the border of the ellipsus. I could be mistaken and I feel like I taste three different uh different levels of strength, but it's still matcha chocolate because it's got the chocolate cream inside. So, not as much, but it's still there, which makes it better, but I'm still not super crazy about it. I'll give it a five. I think I think five is fair for matcha. This looks like it's going to be It went from Italian pig to tea master. Matcha chocolate flavor goes well with green tea. Yeah. No So, this is Ittoen branded matcha, and it says it was supervised by a matcha master. Not unlike what I imagine uh kosher beef, it's supervised by a beef man. Okay, so this seems like it's a different matcha. This two-tone says nothing of it, nor any supervision by any masters of any kind. Am I just getting used to matcha flavor? It's different, but I don't like it any more. I don't care if this was made with name brand tea. I don't care if a master watched you do it. I think it's still a four for me. I don't like it. Next up, matcha latte. See if it's dual tone. I hope so. Nope. Just green. What is going to make it different? It's a lighter green and a creamier, less matchi-y flavor that I actually I do like. It's almost edging in on the white chocolate one, but it does have a little matcha flavor, which is nice. Let's call it a six. Let's call it a six. You and me. Pair of sixes. We're fine. Okay, what to do next? This looks green. Has green elements to it. Let's see what it says. Uh, it's another matcha latte, but this one is Ittoen, and it uses uji matcha. So, perhaps it's a different kind of matcha. One of the more preserved Kit Kats thus far. It's a little tiny bit darker. Tiny tiny bit darker than this one. I think this is a different Kit Kat because it's like it's it's it's their partnership with Ittoen. Okay. I do like that it's it starts as vanilla and then it evolves into matcha. The flavor after a few seconds, but again, not any better. I'm going to give it a six. It's another six. Okay, enough freaking matcha. Unless this is probably also matcha. Please don't just be normal matcha. Please be something interesting. There's pictures of maple. Wait, Japanese >> Japanese maple leaves? Mlanc flavor. Now, Mlanc is a is a mountain in France. And it's also a brand of pretty expensive pens. Wo. Alcohol content 0.1%. Not recommended for children or those with low alcohol tolerance. You're telling me? Okay. And yet it's still uh you know a treat for for kids taking exams because there's the space to write something. So this is alcoholic. Now we have Mlanc which I guess is a chestnut puree. There's some kind of alcohol involved. That's delightful. Vanilla chestnut. I taste chestnut. I don't taste alcohol at all. Then again, there's only 0.1% of it. But it's a delicious flavor. Yeah, that's a delight. Tastes a little fake. That's the only reason I'm going to give it a seven. It's just like a huge improvement on a white chocolate Kit Kat. Pretty much a white Kit Kat. Next up, we got three dupes, I think. And I'm guessing it's going to be dark chocolate. The kit is unique. The flavor is adult sweetness. I think adult flavor or adult strength Kit Kat does mean dark chocolate. In other words, if I open this up and it's white or red or blue or whatever, I will say I'm sorry. Nope. Not today. Let's do a little comparison, but I'm positive that these are all going to be the same. So, I think we're going to have less than 33. There's a lot of dupes in here. This world has the disadvantage that I like dark chocolate. My scores are going to be poisoned as such. Yeah, I love dark chocolate, so this is doing it for me big time. Um, it's just an even better version of the Japanese standard Kit Kat, which is a nice dark ch a slightly more flavorful milk chocolate, edging in on darker ter territory. I gave the original uh Japanese one an eight, which means I think I have to give this a nine. One of my favorite desserts in the world is just sucking on dark chocolate. It's giving me that experience, so why would I not give it a nine? I'm going to give it a nine. This one is relatively unmelted due to its darkness. Ooh. Snaps like a champion. Oh, smells like Hershey's Special Dark. And it tastes like Hershey's Special Dark. This is a different dark chocolate than than the other. It's darker and edging in on like a there's a there's a cherry hue to it. I'd say it's more bitter than that one. I love it. I don't think I love it anymore. It's dark to the point where it's not melting in your mouth the way that you want it to. Like the thing with Kit Kat is while you're chewing it just instantly melts and all turns into this lovely goo your mouth. And this one doesn't really do that, which I'm cool with, but I don't know if you're going to like that. It'd be irresponsible to give it a 10. It's not perfect. And I'm not even sure if I like it as much as the other ones. I love dark chocolate, but this has a wafer in it. And I want to suck this. I don't want to chew this. It's insane for me to say this cuz I like I like the chocolate better, but I know that it is an objectively a worse product. I'm going to give it I'm going to give it an eight. It's great, but I think it's worse than the strong adult flavor. Gold says so right there. Also, kid power not. It could be Whoa. What is going on here? You can't have such a complex flavor that is clearly something completely different and not tell me what it is. Does everyone in Japan see this this this packaging just be like, ""Oh, yeah, that's uh um that's um yeah, that one. I know what that is. It does smell like caramel now. Damn it. Maybe that's just the flavor. It's just gold. Might just be caramel. Caramel chocolate. Golden caramel on top and milk chocolate on the bottom. So yeah, it's chocolate caramel and it's an absolute delight. I love it. And I'm going to give it a tastes a little fake like the caramel tastes fake, but it's still so good. I'm going to give it an eight. The caramel flavor tastes very much like pump caramel like from Dunkin Donuts or another place where there's a pump of caramel flavor. So, it's not bad, but I'm gonna give it an eight for that reason. Otherwise, I give it a nine. This Okay, this one's been interesting me for a while now because it's the only one with the logo, the Kit Kat logo being flanked by wheat. There's wheat. These are whole wheat Kit Kats. I asked this in all sincerity. Why? Why the why? Well, let's find out. Maybe they're delicious. Smells like nothing. Tastes like cereal. Who wanted this? Steve just said, ""Do you think they made this for farmers?"" >> Cuz they always have a little piece of wheat hanging out the middle. >> You know, Steve, I don't think they did that. I think farmers get their fill of wheat. I really don't like it. It's not like offensive tasting, but it's weird. And I'm going to give it a three. Wheat. I don't mean to be culturally insensitive, but what's going on in Japan? Another one I've been mighty curious about, My Sweet Piano. This is a Hello Kitty themed Kit Kat and it has pictures of strawberries on it. Smells like strawberry flavor flavoring. That's interesting that they're putting so much citric acid or whatever they're using to bring tartness to the fruit flavored ones because that is tart. It's not a natural strawberry flavor. Not at all. It tastes like strawberry candy. No chocolate twix the wafers. Something white instead. I like it. I don't love it, but I like it. I'm going to give it a six. It's novel at best. Let's keep strawberrying. Strawberry shortcake flavor. Oh, that's different. Oh, it's white with specks of red. The strawberry Hello Kitty ones are tangier. These are softer, sweeter. They still taste like strawberry. I think I like them better. I love the little red bits. I love that there's not characters I don't understand slathered all over them. I love the white against the like berry red packaging. Like that just feels good to me. These are better. I like these better. And as such, I'm going to give them a seven. Lovely thing to snack on. All right. Now, we've just got Kit Kat strawberry. Strawberry only. This looks the same as the Hello Kitty. And it is another dupe. One more strawberry experience to be had. Or is it? Because there's also this one. If one of these is red on top, chocolate on the bottom, and then the other one's the other way around, I'll piss myself. Okay, we got strawberry on top, cat on the bottom. Feels oddly melty considering we just bought this one. We have an nice intact logo cuz we just went to the Japanese grocery, which wasn't really a Japanese grocery so much as was a specialty store with a couple snacks. They only had one new flavor of Kit Kat. It's strawberry chocolate, so you know it's good. Do I like it more than a regular Kit Kat? No. I like it in a totally different direction, but at the very same level as such, it will receive the same nice odd number. Seven. Strawberry chocolate cake. >> Alcohol content. 07%. No evidence of there being strawberry. What on the inside? Strawberry flavored cream and or wafers are in there. There's a little pink in there. With our previous friend, uh, strawberry was like one of the primary flavors and chocolate was almost secondary. This, it is the exact opposite. Mostly chocolate, that good, high quality Japanese chocolate and some strawberry just notes, which I love. I think this is perfect. I think it's my favorite kit of the day. As such, you know what that means? I'm going to give it a 10. It's perfect. I love it. I love it. What is this one? This one just has a has a white and caramel colored bow. I think caramel colored. What does this say? Strawberry chocolate cake again. Let's verify. Just make sure. Oh, damn it. Missed my favor. Well, that's another one. Um, all right. So, now we have milk tea flavored. And the Japanese blow does indeed say milk tea. I can't believe the that for the wheat one, they put wheat on the logo. They don't do that with any other flavors. Kind of tastes like just generic tea. I think if anything, it's edging in towards Earl Gay. It's nice. It's It's like a DJ Stef kind of Kit Kat. It's like a palette cleansing Kit Kat. It's a It's a breakfast Kit Kat. It tastes like real tea, which I shouldn't be surprised by. Tea is not hard to come by. Do I like it that much? I really can't tell. There was a little bit of bitterness at the end and I almost like that because that that that's what tea tastes like. Has some bitterness to it usually. There's no alcohol in it though, so it's going to cost you. I think I'm going to give it a seven because I really enjoy it, but in a weird way. In a u kind of way. like, oh, melted. Okay. Yeah. Next up, we have cookies and cream, which if it is not white with black speckles, I'll explode. Okay. All right. You get a pass. That is white with black speckles. It's not even a pass so much as it's exactly what I want it to be. Why can't they make a Kit Kat with a chocolate flavored cookie? Are they hiding? Are they running out of chocolate? That's the worst Jerry Seinfeld impression ever. Not only the voice, but also just the concept. Oh, that's good. Oh, perfect. If you like cookies and cream, buy a train ticket. Come to my house. So, I got another half bar here with your name on it because it's perfect cookies and cream flavor. It's just right. It's just really, really tasty. I'm not the biggest cookies and cream guy in the world, and I still think it's tasty. I'm going to give it an eight. Marvelously well executed. Next up, we have a chocolate orange. If this has physical orange on it, I'll be upset. If it has orange cream in the center, I don't care if it tastes like actual dog. I'm giving it a 10. Please be orange. No, that's wishful thinking. I think I have like sugar crash. I think that's what's happening. I think I'm coming near the end of my rope, but now I want to know. I hereby declare orange cream to be the order of the day. I think it's orange. I mean, it's different, right? It's different. But the chocolate has orange essence in it. So why' they make it orange if it is orange? I think I'm drunk off that. Here's what I will say about it, and that's what I'm here to do. It's too orangey. It has too much orange essence. And it's not obviously not real orange flavor. It's orange essence or orange oil. The orange slices, orange slice gummies, the stuff, the big slices that are coated in in like rock sugar. That's the kind of orange that we're talking about here. And there is a smidgen too much of it. I think that the chocolate oranges, Litman's or whatever they're called, >> Terry's. >> Tererry's chocolate oranges. I think they got the balance right and that's why they're the king. It's just a little bit too much of that flavor. If they dialed it back, I would say 20% we'd be talking perfection. Yeah. I don't think I like it as much as the strawberry because it is getting into cloying orange territory. So, I'm going to give it an eight still though. I love chocolate and orange and it's, you know, nice darker chocolate. Tastes great. It's just too orangey. Actually, you know what? No, I'm going to give it a seven. The only lingering flavor right now is orange oil. Like, that's all I can taste now. It tastes like I drank like a warm orange soda. I like it, but it could be so much better. Next up, Kit Kat ice cream cones. I know what you're trying to do here. Okay, the Kit Kat has wafers in it, so it kind of lends itself to being an ice cream cone, but then all that's left after that is chocolate and maybe some cream if they're putting some cream in there. I guess it makes perfect sense. But the chocolate one does not cuz you can't find me that. There's nothing in that ingredient list that indicates what the hell these chunks are. They They must be waffle pieces. Wafer with fudge. Let's start there. Chewy little bastard. Can't even taste it. Just tastes like vanilla and waffle cone. It appears as though that that fudge core goes all the way down. That is a terribly boring frozen ice cream cone with uh some chocolate flavor. Heavy waffle cone flavor. I don't know if that's from the extra bits and pieces or if just the waffle cone is extremely powerful. Chocolate flavor is like non-existent. Even in that fudge core, I can barely taste it. There's nothing about this that reads Kit Kat. Granted, Kit Kat is just wafer cookies with chocolate on them. But that's not what this is, is it? You tried, you failed. And this one's just going to be chocolate ice cream without any fudge core. Another thing that Kit Kats don't have. Yeah, that is just a chocolate most base chocolate ice cream I've ever had with some magic shell on it. And that's it. Again, nothing about this reading Kit Kat. This one's reading more Kit Kat than the other one cuz of, you know, the vanilla ice cream. This tastes more like a Kit Kat to me. A little bit like a little bit more like a Kit Kat, but Kit Kat is just a chocolate wafer. So, what are we talking about here? All right, I'm going to give the fudge core one five. It's an ice cream cone. What am I going to say? Ew, it's bad. No, it's an ice cream cone. I'm going to give this a six cuz I do think it's better. I like chocolate and it's at least reading a little KitKatian. For all the fans of wheat flavored Kit Kats, here's the other direction. What was a Kit Kat flavored like cereal, here's now cereal flavored like Kit Kat. Wa, these are puffy. Does not taste like chocolate at all. It tastes like wheat pretty much, but sweet. This is a horribly boring cereal. Let's see what happens when you pour cold cow tit over top. That tastes nothing like chocolate. Absolutely nothing. That tastes closer to Captain Crunch than it does chocolate. I kind of like it. If you like Captain Crunch, you like this. But I have to take it in account that it is called Kit Kat cereal and that it even suggests to be associated with chocolate cuz it's not. This doesn't taste bad, but it's so visually and conceptually disappointing. Would I keep eating it? Probably. I think I'm going to give it a five for that reason. I think it's passable as a cereal if you don't know what it is and what it's about, what it stands for. Well, there you have it, folks. My 110 for the day. A strawberry chocolate cake Kit Kat. Turns out when you make 300 flavors of something, eventually you settle on something perfect. And that's what Kit Kat has done. Some surprises in here. Uh there's one that tastes like a candle. There's ice cream mas and cereal that are just utter charlatans just masquerading as Kit Kat. No white chocolate Kit Kats, but there are white Kit Kats and there's wheat Kit Kats and it's the only one to have spring of wheat added to the logo. I had a good time. There's so many more Kit Kat flavors out there that I will feel compelled when we go to Japan again sometime in the future to uh expound and expand and expune. But for now, here's my top pick. Strawberry chocolate cake. a damn near perfect food. Thank you guys so much for watching. Please let me know in the comments below. What flavors of Kit Kat did I miss? There's a lot of them.

ojMsPVVZqdg,"Steak, come get you some steak. Can you handle it? Steak from around the world. There, that's actually works. Steak is genuinely one of my favorite foods and presumably one of yours if you clicked on this and you're watching it. And today we're going to explore all different kinds of steaks from around the globe, the world. The pale blue dot, Terra. It's stakes from around the world. Let's get started with where are we starting? The USA. This episode is sponsored by Challenge Dairy. The new butter in my kitchen. Challenge, the butter with the elk on it, is in the same family as Danish crearyy, but Challenge has innovated the way we use butter. They have these cubes in four tablespoon chunks, so you can throw one into your noodles, your pan sauce, or your potatoes. Today, I'm using butter in a few of these steak preparations so you can see how to use butter in your steak and grilling recipes this summer. For more info on challenge and to find yourself some butter cubes, scan the QR code or head the link in the description. For this steak, I'm going as American as it gets and making a tomahawk ribeye. Oversized, ostentatious, and positively loaded with fat. It's about as American as it gets. As with most pieces of whole meat, we're starting with a dry brine. I'm doing a 1:1 mixture of kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, generously coating on all sides, placing on a wire rack set in a rim baking sheet and letting stand at room temperature for at least an hour or ideally frriging uncovered overnight. The salt draws out moisture which over time is reabsorbed, making the steak tender, deeply flavorful and susceptible to more profound browning. Now, the first adjective I would use to describe this steak is thick. Whenever that's the case, usually that means you want to do a reverse sear. burying a temperature probe at its thickest point and roasting in a 225 degree Fahrenheit oven until that probe reads 115 degrees Fahrenheit for what will eventually be medium rare. While that's going, I'm going to amp up the Americanness with some so-called cowboy butter, combining two sticks of room temperature butter with three cloves of grated garlic, pinch of red chili flake, 1 tbspoon dijon mustard, tablespoon of horseradish, and kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. I don't know what makes this cowboy butter, but I must be a horse because I want it to ride me. Sorry. Mash until homogeneous. Taste for seasoning. And then we're going to class things up by rolling this butter into a ballotine, which is just fancy speak for log. Dolloping the butter onto a sheet of plastic wrap. Rolling up and shaping into a log, which can then be sliced into super sexy cylinders. Make sure it's nice and tubular. Then chill for about 2 hours or until completely solid. Unwrap, slice, and make sure to let these cylinders come to room temperature before bringing it anywhere near your steak. Speaking of which, the big guy's headed out of the oven right now. Looking not so great. But don't worry, that's our next job. I'm going to brush the steak down on all sides plus the bone with a little bit of vegetable oil to assist in browning. Now, you could sear this steak on a ripping hot cast iron pan, but to better the browning of the bone, I'm opting for a blazing hot grill. Preheat it at maximum velocity for at least 10 minutes before brushing and oiling the grates, making sure that our giant jointed juicy cow doesn't embarrass us in front of our family by sticking. Now, there's so much fat on this guy that there's going to be flare-ups. Soon as that starts happening, move the steak to a different part of the grill. as flare-ups can cause a sort of carbonized burnt flavor. After three to five minutes, you should have fantastic color on every side of the steak. And the internal temperature should be bumped up 510 degrees Fahrenheit, which after the requisite 10-minute rest should translate to a final temperature of 135° F, meaning a rosy red interior with fully rendered fat and meat that's tender, not slippery. Carve it right off the bone. Slice it into steakhouse slabs. I like to orient the steak during slicing so that every piece has some of the cap, the ultra fatty band that goes around the outside of a ribeye steak. I also like to slice on a bias. Meat fibers in this kind of steak run vertically. So, by cutting the steak on an angle, we're cutting across more of those fibers, resulting in an even more tender steak. Arrange on a platter with the bone just to be a showoff and top with your cowboy butter while the steak is still hot, ensuring that it melts and bathes every slice in its cowboy buttery goodness. >> This is my territory. This is a United States steak. Here we are, folks. One of my favorite steaks personally, a bone in ribeye reverse seared and smeared down with cowboy butter, which is not a dublon tandra. It's a singlon tandra. Let's eat it. Just the height of richness and excess. It's American as apple pie. Definitely more elegant ways that you could plate it up, but this is one of my favorite ways to do it. Feels rustic. Feels honest, naked. True. Cowboy butter. The beauty of the ribeye is this. The cap. The cap is one of the best pieces there is of cow. It's completely just dripping with fat and and and so tender. It's so flavorful. It's almost like you took the eye of the ribeye and doubled all of its attributes. You've been saving up all those all those points, those skill points, XP, and you were like, ""You know what? Double everything."" You ever done that? You know what combat is like after that? like like just how powerful you feel. Well, that's the ribeye cap experience. You know how the kids say no cap? Well, you kids, I'm all cap. Next up, we're headed to Turkey with shish kebab. combining four cloves of minced garlic, 1/4 teaspoon of Aleppo, 1 tsp oregano/4 cup of yogurt, 1 tbsp of roasted red pepper paste/ teaspoon of sumac, 1 tbsp of salt, and the juice of one lemon, which we're going to combine into a marinade for our meat. The meat of which is going to be 1 and 1/2 in cubes of chuck, an inexpensive cut with great fat and flavor content. Mash around to coat evenly, maybe in a larger bowl than I'm using. Cover with plastic wrap and fridge for at least 2 hours, ideally overnight. Then we're going to build our skewers, which are going to be doubled up. This prevents the meat from spinning on the skewer, making it much easier to flip on the grill. Load up your skewer thick and proud. Then we're headed over to the hot side of an indirect grill, getting some great char on the meat on the hot side of the grill before moving it over to the cool side to finish cooking through to a rosy medium. While it's over there coming up to temp, I'm going to use the hot side of the grill to toast some lovely pas. No more than a minute or so per side and keeping warm in a clean kitchen towel. Then all there is left to do is whack off your meat, pile proudly on a paup, and garnish with thinly sliced red onions, a sprinkle of sumac, a squeeze of lemon, and some torn parsley. And there you have it, shish kebab. But how does it taste? For that, I'm going to hand it off to me in the past because obviously I'm doing this voice over after we shot this. It's confusing, but time travel always is. All right, shish kebab. Let's try it. These being chunks of chuck, you want to cook them to like a solid medium because there's some connective tissue and stuff in there that if you cook it to medium rare, I know that's cool, but like it's just going to be a better eating experience if you push it to medium. And if you have, you know, family members that like their meat medium well well done, pretty good option cuz you're marinating this meat. So, it's just going to stay a little juicier and a little more tender thanks to the enzymes in the yogurt and the acid and the acids. Then those nice little sumac onions and lemon on there. Sumac has a familiar kind of citrusy flavor. And then, you know, make sure you toast the hell out of your pa. You get this great char on there. Makes me want to get hair plugs just so I can make the trip. Eat one of these. But don't worry, I'm not going to do that. Next up, we're headed to Mexico for some carne asada. First creating a marinade of one sliced jalapeno, 2 tbsps neutral oil, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, the juice of two limes, about 1/4 cup of lime juice, three smashed cloves of garlic, 1 teaspoon each cumin, chili powder, and coriander, 2 tbsps panella or raw sugar, and 1/4 cup of sour orange juice. These are pretty hard to find, so if all you can find are regular oranges, just supplement with a little bit of lemon juice. Last but not least, one can of Mexican logger. Particularly excited about this because I have never marinated in beer before. Mix all that up. Make sure all the sugars and stuff are dissolved. And we're going to use that to marinate some skirt steak, a cut that responds particularly well to marination. Simply plop in a plastic bag or highwalled casserole and pour this hot sweet spicy beer stuff over top. Massage around to make sure everybody's evenly coated and fridge for at least 4 hours and up to overnight. If you're using a bag, place it in a rimmed baking sheet to minimize chances of crosscontamination. Once marinated, they're going to look pretty gross. The acid in the marinade is going to make them lose their vibrant red color. But don't worry, after we thoroughly pat them dry and sear the hell out of them in a hot grill, you'll forget all about this grayish brown nightmare. Speaking of which, we're headed out to the same indirect grilling setup. Dropping these guys first onto the hot side of the grill. Because skirt steaks are usually not terribly thick, the time it takes to sear them on both sides might be all the time they need to cook through. I'm also closing the grill in between flips to keep the temperature high. Once you've got some, let's face it, perfect grill marks on both sides. Transfer things over onto the cooler side of the grill if they need some more carryover heat to finish cooking and use the hot side of the grill this time to toast tortillas because it is my intention to make some carneasada tacos. That is if I don't lose too many through the grill. Now once you've let these guys rest for 10 minutes, how you slice them is very important. Skirt steak has a very distinct grain that runs perpendicular to its length. So first I'm going to cut it in half to make it more manageable to slice. Then I'm cutting across the grain at an angle. Cutting those muscle fibers short is of the utmost importance. Otherwise, you're going to have a really stringy, really tough steak. Going to cut those slices into bite-sized chunks. I've tried too many times to use whole strips of steak in a taco, and it's just not a good look. Garnish with finely chopped white onion, sliced jalapenos, a squeeze of lime, and some parsley, pretending to be cilantro. Carneada made with uh a little bit of parsley instead of cilantro because I want to like it. Let's see what we're dealing with here. This is a really really great way to use cuts like flank and skirt and hanger. These tougher cuts that benefit both from being cooked and sliced a very specific way to maximize tenderness but also marinated. Um, and marinating in beer is a very very cool move. Like it adds this whole malty yeasty element to it that I'm really enjoying married with, you know, a little bit of heat and vegetitality from the jalapenos. um the nice acid of the lime and the you know freshness of the onions. This is one high quality taco. Also carneada but uh skirt steak in particular. This is a great steak for when you have multiple diners who have different temperature preferences because they tend to be uneven. They tend to be really thick at one end, very thin at the other. Some even have thick points and thin points and as a result you end up with all different dnesses. There's no avoiding it. You can't cook this kind of steak uniformly. So, it makes for great eating for when you have, you know, people who aren't into red or or medium rare meat. You know, losers. I'm kidding. That's what, you know, who would say? Who am I say? Who who Next up, a dish I've never tried from a place I've never been to. Crying Tiger from Thailand. First, a marinade of 2 tbsps of oyster sauce, four cloves finely minced garlic, 1 and 1/2 tbsps of granulated sugar, 1 and 1/2 tbsps of fish sauce, 1 tbsp of soy sauce, and 1 teaspoon of ground white pepper. Give that a mix. And this time, we're pouring it over flank steak, which just like skirt steak, is uneven, tough, and fibrous, and takes very well to marination. Same deal. Ziploc bag, 4 to 24 hours in the fridge. Pat dry and grill. This time, I've got the right side all hoted up. Sorry if that's confusing. I tend to prefer to grill marinated steaks as they require high heat, generate a lot of smoke, and tend to stick more easily. Being a much thicker cut of meat than a skirt steak, however, this guy's really going to rely upon the indirect grilling system where it can gently come up to temperature after we've achieved a great crust on both sides. I'm pulling this guy when he's around 1251 130, which should carry over up to 135 140, which is right where I like flank steak to live. Now to serve, we're going to make a sauce of 2 tbsps lime juice, 1 tbsp water, 1/4 cup of finely minced shallot, two scallions, thinly sliced, 1/4 cup chopped cilantro, 3 tbsps fish sauce, 2 tbsps tamarind juice, a tablespoon of dried chili flakes, couple pinches of sugar just to taste, and 1/4 cup of toasted rice powder. This is a pretty specialty ingredient, so if you can't get a hold of it, might not be authentic, but don't worry, it's still going to taste plenty good. Mix that stuff together. Put it in a more camera friendly bowl. And now it's time to slice and serve the steak. Once again, we want to locate the grain of this steak and slice across it, ensuring that the muscle fibers are nice and short and we end up with a juicy, tender steak. Fanata on the plate, garnish with cilantro and dig in. All right, crying tiger. This steak is cooked very much to my liking. Uh flank steak has, you know, enough sort of tougher connective tissue bits that I don't mind pushing it to a nice medium as long as it's a uniform medium. And crying tiger is also supposed to be righteously spicy. So, we did load it up with the pepper flake there, but let's find out. The marinade is so fantastic just on its own because the soy and fish sauce and oyster sauce deeply flavor the meat. And then you add sugar to get this incredible browning on the outside. You can see how beautiful this crust comes out. That's because of the sugar that creates caramelization way more quickly. So, you do have to be careful of it burning. Yeah, this is a really exciting way to prepare steak. One that I'm definitely going to be doing again. It's just a bold, I would say, even unexpected flavor in the world of beef. So, do with that information what you will. I'm going to make some more or I'm going to eat some more. Next up, we're taking a look at a Korean steak called Galby. First, building a marinade in a blender, combining a/2 cup soy sauce, 1/4 cup of water, a teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper, 2 tbsps of raw sugar, three cloves of garlic, 1/2 in worth of peeled and chopped ginger, half a medium roughly chopped onion, and half a peeled, seated, and roughly chopped Asian pear. One of the many things that gives Korean barbecue and bulgogi its unique flavor. Blend in the blender until blended. Then I'm adding a tablespoon each sesame oil and sesame seeds. Blending lightly so that the seeds don't liquefy. And pouring over some Koreanstyle short ribs. A tough fatty cut made tender by our flavorful complex marinade. Again, you can do this in a zip top bag, but I thought it was about time I demonstrated it in a casserole. Give it a good shake and wiggle to make sure that everybody's evenly coated. And I forgot you're supposed to put two thinly sliced scallions in there. So, I'm just going to sprinkle them over top and kind of convince them to be in the marinade. Just pretend that never happened. And then this guy's headed into the fridge to marinate for 6 to 24 hours. From there, it's a pretty familiar procedure. We're pulling it out of the marinade, patting it dry, give it a sort of wipe with your hand to remove any excess scallion or sesame seeds that would burn on the grill, which is where we are once again headed, where, just like the skirt steak, we are searing these guys hot and fast. Think of it like Korean barbecue. By the time it's got a great char on it, it's ready to go. Make sure your grates are extra brushed and oiled because all the sugar and stuff in the marinade is going to want to make it stick extra badly. Get some gorgeous color on there and bring it on inside for trimming and eating, which we're going to simply do by trimming off the row of bones. This can be gnawed on by the chef as a snack later. This is also pretty commonly done with scissors at Korean barbecue joints. So, if that's easier for you, this is one of life's very rare opportunities to use scissors on beef. Once you got the bones off, we're going to trim these down into bite-sized pieces, which we're going to pile high into a romaine lettuce leaf. Topping with thinly sliced scallions, jalapenos, and garlic cloves, as well as a generous drizzle of samjang. Uh, kali, this is our Korean entrant. This looks fantastic. Let's eat it. Korean style short ribs are cut not only across the bone, they're cut across the grain. So, it's the same principle behind cutting across the grain with flank steak, skirt steak, hanger steak. It shortens the muscle fibers. So, a notoriously tough, normally slow and low cut like short ribs become something you can just fire on the grill as hard as you can, as hot as you can, till you just can't take it anymore. And that's got to be the samjang sauce just brings this nice bit of heat. It's really nice to eat it in a lettuce wrap. It's going to be nice to eat it with rice. Maintaining eye contact while you eat your power move. Didn't you just feel it shrink? Mine did the opposite. >> Next up, Japanese yakaniku style Wagyu. Or perhaps more accurately, Australian style yakaniku style Wagyu because this is an Australian style Wagyu ribeye, which I'm going to trim down into a rectangular uniform piece. Being sure to save the cap and fat for other uses because today we're just going to focus on the eye, which I'm going to try to cut into as uniform slices as possible. This is a very precise and elegant dish, so the more attention to detail you can spare, the better. Now, the desired outcome for these tiny little slices is seared on the outside, rare on the inside. We could, of course, just slam them in a ripping hot cast iron skillet, but the more proper way is with a binchan grill, for which we need to use binchan charcoal, an extremely expensive, efficient, and long- lasting Japanese charcoal. One that takes a solid 15 to 20 minutes of continuous exposure to fire to properly light. I'm using a charcoal chimney, but you're probably better off just throwing these directly on the burners of your gas grill. While those get lit, we're going to make a very simple dipping sauce. Combine a/3 of a cup of soy sauce, 1 teaspoon rice wine vinegar, 1/4 cup each sake and mirin, 1 tbsp of granulated sugar, 1 tbsp sesame oil, and 2 tbsps of sesame seeds. Then this whole affair is just going to get cooked for about 5 minutes to cook off the alcohol from the mirin. Now our bean chantan charcoal is fully ignited, and it looks like rods of plutonium. I'm going to try to stack them as tall as I can in the binchan grill. I want to hit these little slices with as much heat as humanly possible. Then, fun little trick I learned is to rub the grate down with a piece of your Wagyu fat. This is basically just a way cooler and smokier way to oil your grill grates. Just before grilling, I'm going to hit these guys with a gestal amount of kosher salt just because grilling unseasoned beef feels immoral to me. But then again, I have warped values. Now, as you're about to see, it is very important that this grill be ripping hot. This grill was running a little bit too cool, so it took an almost interminable 45 seconds for them to get a proper sear. This meat is so fatty and so much of that fat rendered out that it ended up curling the meat. I also went for far too dark a crust and even at the Australian Wagyu price point, this is not a meat that you want to make mistakes with. For the next round, I rearranged the coals so that they were stacked higher, creating more direct heat on the grate and letting me flip the pieces sooner, ensuring that this beautiful beef only gets kissed with heat before serving. So, next up we have Wagu. It's the big bad beefy bastard of the bunch because it costs in excess of $80 a pound. At least this one did. A5 Wagu is almost pure fat. And this is kind of where I like to live actually. I like an Australian Wagu or a less marbled Wagu because it's just more palatable to me. We have two different preparations here. sort of a very rare proper preparation and a more like a medium accidental preparation. So, you know, let's go with the real deal, shall we? My bean chantan wasn't quite hot enough. You want a little bit more color on there, but I do know that this is cooked properly at least. Nice and rare. Just enough heat for the fat to render out. So, it's just dumb dumb soft. It's just wildly deeply beefy and fatty, mouthcoating, unctuous. And then the sauce both compliments and cuts through it, which you need. It's so fatty that you can have it on its own, but I prefer with a little bit of sauce. It's such an expensive piece of beef and one that is so labored over by the people who make it that, you know, it feels fitting that the best way to eat it is respectfully and minimally. Just kiss it with heat and optionally serve it with a bright, you know, punchy sesame sauce. This is beef. Very fatty beef. Soft, luxurious. Edging in on editorial. Uh, melts in the mouth. Sick, hot, nasty ass beef. God, I love it. Next up, we're headed to Googa country, that is Brazil, for the ever popular picana cut of beef. This is a specialty cut from the rump of the cow with fibrous, well-marbled meat and a huge fat cap. To prep it, we're going to cut it into steaks across the grain. So once you cut it, you shouldn't see long strands of meat. You should see what look like the ends of a whole lot of little cables. When we serve, we're going to be carving across this direction, so everything's going to be super duper tender. I'm cutting this into about 1 in thick steaks, which felt plenty thick to me at the time, but I discovered was inadvisable. Brazilian steakhouse style picana is cut into these sorts of steaks and folded over onto itself almost like you're making a sea or you depending on whether or not you're lying down. It then gets threaded onto a spit so that it can then be rotisseried. I cut my steaks too thin so they had a hell of a time getting on that spit, but eventually I got them on there. Next up, we're seasoning with one thing, coarse rock salt. You could definitely use normal kosher salt or any kind of salt you want, but this has a bit more theater to it. Once your meat is salted and spitted, we're headed back out to the grill where I am putting to use the rotisserie attachment that I bought online. My grill also sort of has this blast furnace in back for just such applications. I'm going to center these guys up with the heat source and set them to spinning for a completely unpredictable amount of time. It's going to depend on your heat source and the thickness of your steaks. But suffice it to say, you're going to want to cook these between medium rare to medium. Enough time for the fat cap to render entirely and for the meat to be rosy red inside. Now, while these guys rest, we're going to whip up a very simple Brazilian salsa, a common condiment found in charascaria. Finally, diced white onion, green pepper, tomato, and parsley get combined in a large bowl, drizzled with olive oil and white vinegar, seasoned with salt and pepper, and toss to combine. Bust out the beef and then pretend that you're a guy that's good at this while you're carving it up. Beef respects confidence. Again, we're carving along the side of the steak so that we're cutting across the muscle fibers, creating some nice, tender, shaved bits of beef. Top with the salsa and get ready to be transported to my favorite place to have a birthday party in my 20s, the Brazilian steakhouse. Brazilian picana. Whoever made this kind of screwed up a little bit. I think they cut the steaks way too thin, so it was really hard to shave off. It looked like it was hard for them to shave it off and uh it made the whole thing a little janky. So bear that in mind. But all that to be said, this is the legendary picna cut of beef rotisserie roasted shaved and and here right here. Whoever made it, that dude still managed to do I think a really great job. Even though I think they screwed up bad. Wow. Is that the dialogue that goes on in my head all day? It is maddening. Huge pop of salt from that rock salt on the outside. So that's that's actually really nice. There's still some crunchy bits of salsa on the outside and, you know, nice hit of freshness from the salsa, but like the the beef is so great because it's it's pretty much like a really classy roast beef. Like if you had roast beef, but you ate it while it was hot with a fork and knife instead of, you know, the other way. Normally when you're grilling, that drips down under the heat element, flares up, and it puts soot all over your steak. And because this was elevated on the spit and getting heated both from the backsplash burner that I have in my grill, but also from the radiant heat below, it got to get all those like smoky hits of flavor when the flare-ups occurred without any of the soot or the more bitter acurid elements that would have ended up on the meat. It's a really cool way to cook. I sure wish it was more accessible and something that you might even reasonably do. It's a damn fine steak. I'm sure I did everything wrong. Next up, we're headed to France for something of a unique steak preparation. Steak Auave. Not only are these flamin gum served with a peppercorn sauce after being hit on all sides with kosher salt, they're also going to be crusted in peppercorns. Fresh, very coarsely ground peppercorns that we're going to toss around in a fine mesh sie to filter out any smaller particles, which will much more easily burn when the steak is seared. Then we're going to press the top and the bottom of each steak directly into the peppercorns. Basically creating a whole new surface area that's going to be seared instead of the beef. These guys are getting placed in a ripping hot well lubricated stainless steel pan. No more than 1 to 2 minutes per side so that the peppercorns don't burn. I'm also going to sear the sides of the steak a little bit to make sure that we have good color all around. Then these guys are headed onto a rack set in a rim baking sheet so they can slowly come up to temperature in a 225° Fahrenheit oven. Meanwhile, I've wiped the burnt oil out of the pan. I'm adding two or three tablespoons of challenge butter and using them to sauté half a small finely minced shallot. Using the moisture from said shallot to scrape up the fond off the bottom of the pan. Then I'm adding another tablespoon or so of freshly ground black peppercorns. Letting them toast just for about 30 seconds or so until they're really really nice and fragrant. And then it's time to play with fire. Because while the pan's nice and hot, we're going to take it off the heat. Adding about a/2 cup of conac and igniting the fumes. Flaming is really just for show. You do not need to do this. But also look at that fireball. I mean, you kind of need to do this, right? Let the flames die down and the alcohol cook off. Then we're adding 8 oz of demiglass, a super concentrated ve stock. If you can't get your hands on this, just boil a quart of beef stock until it's reduced by about 75% down to one cup. Likewise, once in the pan, this concentrated stock is going to reduce once again by half, creating a devastatingly rich, spicy, boozy, meaty sauce. We're going to cook it for a few more minutes until it's super thick and glossy, and then cut it with a couple tablespoons of heavy cream. Cook for about one more minute and then it's time to carve and serve. These steaks have been cooked to 120 in the hopes that they will rise to the low end of medium rare, about 130 degrees Fahrenheit. Any cooler and we'll have tough muscle fibers. Any warmer, it's going to be dry as a bone. Once again, I like carving on a bias. This just helps amplify tenderness. Fan them out, saucite. Oh, the French champagne manufactures good from French grapes. I can't remember what he says, but I just remember that action. Yes. A French champ. >> Ah, the French champagne. >> But this is the French steak. So, take that, Orson Wells. One of my favorite steak preparations. Oddly enough, one of the few steak preps, if any actually, where there's no real mayard happening. Most of the high heat application, the browning takes place with the peppercorns, not with the steak itself. Perfectly beautifully cooked. Bravo to the that guy. Cognac in pan sauces can be really cloying, can taste really weird. In awa, it tastes absolutely perfect. It's like what cognac was invented for. Not for drinking, but for putting in this sauce. So far with all these steak preparations, what we're seeing is a great balance between flavors. Like this the the texture of the steak is is really up to you. It's almost secondary. The these preparations are about, you know, what do we do to complement these extraordinarily rich, meaty, beefy applications. And this is got to be the most sophisticated. I guess it's French. M. And it goes really nicely with a little bit of measuring cupac. >> Oh my. Next up, we're headed back to the American South for a decidedly economical option, chicken fried steak. I have two discount shell steaks here that I'm going to trim the excess fat and connective tissue off of before using any number of means to pound out and perforate them. That is, get them flat and uniform and puncture repeatedly to tenderize. Most straightforward option is just a zip top bag and a Babish heavy bottom hard anodized laser titanium forever non-stick saucepan and then taking a pair of forks or even one fork would be fine and just stabbing the out of it. Not so much that it's falling apart, but this step is going to tenderize it so that we can eat it with a butter knife. The simpler but more specialty option is a steak needler, a device that pounds out and punctures in the same breath. This is however pretty much the only thing it can do, so I understand if you don't want to buy one. Once you got your steaks all smacked out and poked up, it's time to place them in a marinade/initial breading mixture. Combination of one and a half cups of buttermilk, one large egg, two teaspoons of kosher salt, and 1 teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper beaten together into a slurry and poured over our waiting beef where they can then marinate for anywhere from 2 to 4 hours. While those guys hang out, we can make our redeye gravy. Heating 2 tablespoons of challenge butter in a small stainless sauté pan and using it to build a r with 2 tbsp of flour. Whisk together and cook for 1 to two minutes before slowly adding one cup of coffee one little splash at a time. Whisking each addition until it's completely incorporated before adding the next. It's going to look a little lumpy chunky, but don't worry. As long as you allow the liquid to completely absorb in the flour each addition, it will smooth out. Once you got all the coffee in there, we're going to cook this mixture for a couple minutes. Then I'm going to add a tiny splash of some Louisiana Crystal hot sauce, kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper, and I like to add a/2 cup of beeftock just to mellow out the coffee flavor. To that end, I'm also going to add a little drizzle of honey. Taste for seasoning and set aside until ready to serve. Next up, we got to bread and fry our steak. I'm seasoning some all-purpose flour with half teaspoon each, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder. About 1 cup of flour that I'm going to tiny whisk until homogeneous. Then the steaks are headed straight out of the marinade and into ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
his flour mixture in about one of the easiest breading procedures yet discovered. Make sure every nook and or cranny is fully coated with flour before bringing these bad boys over to some 375° Fahrenheit neutral flavored oil. Carefully dropping the steaks in away from you and frying for anywhere from 3 to 5 minutes until deeply golden brown and cooked through. I'm also going to take a page out of the Colonel's book and filter out some of this deep fried flour goo and add it to my redeye gravy, which is just going to make things even more awesome. Saddle up your steak. Give me that gravy. And get ready to disappoint your doctor, cuz all those numbers they've been telling you to keep down are about to go up. Chicken fried steak. Good and crunchy. The steak is nice and tender. It's probably too hot to put in my mouth. It is. Every time I've had chicken fried steak, it's been with uh sausage gravy, which is wonderful, but it does drown out the steak experience. It just tastes like sausage gravy. This tastes like steak with coffee gravy instead of just gravy. You know what I'm trying to say? Don't you? I mean this in the best possible way. That's nasty. You got a cheap ass cut of beef. You got a bunch of corn oil. You got coffee from yesterday morning. I think I know what you're making for dinner tonight. this because this has to be far and away the most cheapest preparation of anything today. Dollars to donuts. I don't know if I like the other ones better. Like this is gross, but in all the right way, all the very best ways. Like steak, coffee, deep fried breading, cheap. It's not a flavor. It's so good. And if the question is would I rather have this or stega puave, a fussy Frenchy festidious food, I would say I don't know because these are both just as delicious in very, very different ways. I've eaten half of it. I haven't done that with any of these yet. Last, but certainly not least, we have beef de chorizo. Another form of picana. This time sliced into steaks and served with a bright fresh chimmy cherry. Hailing from Argentina. This time we're slicing the steaks with the grain. Feels counterintuitive, but then when your diners eat it, they'll be cutting across the grain themselves, making each bite tender. These guys are getting seasoned once again with the requisite rock salt. And they love open fire cooking in Argentinian steakouses. So, that's what I'm going to try to poorly imitate with my campfire pit. Unlike the so-called gaucho grill, a fire pit has no height adjustment and therefore no temperature adjustment. So, these guys are going to sear at the rate that my fire dictates. I'm searing these guys on both sides and then giving their fat caps a little extra love to make sure that they're fully rendered because this is a steak for fat lovers. And by fat lovers, I mean people who love the actual channels of pure fat that run around the outside of some steaks. Last up, we're making our chimmy chur table style. That is combining equal parts oregano and parsley, seasoning them with salt, and then finely chopping them into almost a paste. Place this in a bowl with one clove of garlic, grated, a pinch of crushed red chili flake, and a ratio of about 3:1 extra-virgin olive oil to red wine vinegar. That way, when we beat this together with a fork or tiny whisk, it's going to emulsify into a sauce. If it's too thick, add oil. If it's thin and it has a layer of oil floating on top, add vinegar. What you want is a thin dressing like herb sauce. Season to taste. Slice up your pana. Admire just how darn juicy it is. And slather with chimmy cherry to your heart's content. Beef chorizo. I don't know why it's called that. Isn't chorizo a kind of sausage? >> Yes. I'm confused. >> I love this. I loved cooking it because I love things over open fire, but also I love that uh you can see it on the whole steaks before slicing. See that just sort of subtle pinkishness out on the outside? That's just smoke. That's just smoke that's been absorbed by the buff. This is a fat lover's drink. I tell you why. You got that cap. Pana has a huge fat cap. Uh so you just basically get this gigantic chunk of rendered fat that you get to just eat at your leisure. You can cut off as much or as little as you want. It's your decision. In Argentina, you're in charge. The name is derived because the steak is supposed to be slightly cylindrical and elongated in form which bears resemblance to a sausage. It has nothing to do with the sausage. >> Well, that's why beef deizo because it looks like a sausage. >> Not this is a fantastic way to make steak. Not only is it super fun, easy to grill steaks over an open fire, but also you get this great textural choice, how much fat you want, how much meat you want in each bite. Uh, you get the nice like smoky flavors from the fire, this very strong flavor. So then you got this super bright herby fresh chimmy cherry cutting through all of it. I've said cutting through all of it like 10 times now. Well folks, that's it. 10 different steaks from 10 different points on this big blue ball of beef we call earth. I got to experience a wide variety of different flavors and textures and treatments of the cow. And that's a very interesting experiment to to to undertake because then it gets you thinking what can I try differently next time? What can what flavors can I combine? What techniques can I combine? So, I encourage you to try some of these yourselves, to try seeing what works between the different techniques, and to be a little bit kinder to your neighbor. After all, they came up with all this. So, can't be that bad, right? Stop being racist is what I'm saying. Please comment below what was your favorite steak you saw today. Which ones did I miss? And what food do you want to see me explore next? Chicken from around the world. Here's chicken from all over. Actually, that didn't sound that bad. Yeah, >> we'll see you next time on chicken from around the world. We'll see you next time on round the world and 10 chickens. Around the world and 10 biff decas day. I'm Andrew Babish and this has been daily news. I've loved working with Danish crearyy. So I'm excited to partner with another butter in the same family, Challenge Dairy, the one with the elk on it. Challenge is special because all of their dairy farmers are in California and the butter is all made in California. So, there's no more than 48 hours from cow to butter. This means the butter is incredibly fresh and that Challenge is sustainable with a low carbon footprint. With these new butter cubes, Challenge is perfectly portioned and ready for your next kitchen project. I can't wait to show you what we get up to next month with more butter. For more info on Challenge and find yourself some butter cubes," scan the QR code or head to the description.

TUjfLGtCsg0,"Oh, this sundae is going to taste great. >> Thinly slice a large Videlia onion. Filling a bowl with our ice cream surrogate, aka a whole bottle of ketchup. Scattering our Vidilia onions across the top and leaving plenty of room for our Tennessee red organic heirloom peanut plant. Roots, dirt, and all. As Spongebob said, a little texture never hurt. Except that eating dirt is a very effective way to give yourself a parasite. I had to Google that and I came across a lot of articles on the subject because apparently there's a lot of people out there that like to eat dirt. I however am not one of them. So, I'm going to carefully scoop around the dirt, grab some peanut greens, which are apparently perfectly edible. And here we go. Let's try a bite of Spongebob's improvised sundae, which I hopefully shouldn't have to tell you is not very good. It's ketchup, onions, and leaves. It's like eating a burger without the bun or the burger.

kjt9Z0SnXSA,"I'm currently driving across the country attempting to recreate the road trip from the movie Chef. And on a journey like this, you can find yourself craving a taste of home. Something consistent in a sea of changing landscapes. A bastion of familiarity. A place where you know exactly what you're going to get. Now, sure, virtually any fast food chain or restaurant in this great nation could fit that bill. But there's one that holds a special place in my heart. One you'll see signs for peppered along the interstate. And that's what inspired this series of important culinary detours. [Applause] All right, folks. Well, we literally just saw a sign for Cracker Barrel and in that moment, an entire video was born. We're ranking everything at Cracker Barrel. I >> mean, it's perfect because we can eat a reasonable amount each time we stop and we can get the whole menu done as we go across the country. >> I thought we were just going to >> or we can do it all right now. >> I grew up going to Crack and Barrel because guess what? It's kind of good. And because there's license plates on the wall and because there's an oldtimey gift shop where you can buy straight candy cane in different flavors other than mint. Ah, it's in the outlet mall. Where am I? Heaven. Our cup runth over. I'm going to tell you a personal thing on camera. That's what vlogging is all about. I've been addicted to nicotine for just over a decade. Uh, I started smoking cigarettes after a bad breakup cuz I thought it was cool. And then I started vaping to quit. And then I just never quit vaping. And uh yesterday was my first day in 10 years with absolutely zero nicotine intake the entire day. So we're celebrating here at Cracker Barrel. >> What are you doing? >> Uh what does it look like again? >> Does this need explanation? Do you see where we are? Do you see what's in front of me? Do you see the joy in my eyes? >> You are about to overeat. All right, folks. You might have seen this if you've ever eaten a Cracker Barrel. This is the Cracker Barrel IQ test. If basically what you do is you have one empty peg here, and you jump these um golf uh TE's, I guess, over other golf tees. And when you jump it over, it's like checkers. You take it out. If you can end up with one one peg left, you're a genius. Leave two. Rocking the chair, but not the game. That's the most gangster ever heard in my life. Okay, let's see what my and Brad's intelligence quotient are. Damn it. All right. Well, two, I'm rocking the chair, but not the game. So, sayith Rick Ross. >> All right. I'm going to go and let my subconscious do the work here, and I'm not going to think about any of my moves. So, I'm going to do this very quickly, and we're going to see what happens. >> Let go of your mind. Your intuition is strong. Be one with the game. Move the pins. Cracker barrel. Biscuits. Pancakes. Cornbread. Old people. [Music] What the are we doing here? What was that? I feel like we just went just a miracle. And if you didn't get that on camera, I would never believe it. I've never done it. >> I feel like I just watched somebody solve two Rubik's cubes, one in each hand. That was that was some serious like wow. You should really You should really feel feel good about that. So, I'm going to do the uh classic sampler, please. All three. I'm going to do that with mac and cheese and green beans, please. >> Now, I'm going to do the country fried steak, the hash brown casserole, and grits. Well, folks, it's exactly the way I remember it. On eclectic serving wear in these little ceramic bowls that are made from the same stuff as the diner mugs and just overflowing with portions. Where to begin? Probably start with biscuits, right? With some real butter. No strawberry preserves for me. Thanks. Little bit of butter on my biscuit. What do we do now? >> Just take a bite. >> You're supposed to eat it now. >> Yeah. Yeah. Just >> Okay. I'm sorry. I've never been here before. I was never really crazy about their biscuits. They're drop style and they taste like Pillsbury. They taste like shortening. They don't taste like butter. And they might be made with butter, but they don't taste like it. Biscuits. I'm going to rank a five. Like I'd eat this whole thing, but it's not my favorite thing that they do here. I know what they can do when they put their minds to it. Or should I say their hearts. I'm not a huge fan of their biscuits. I'm sorry. But you know what? I am a huge fan of their chicken and dumplings, which as far as I'm aware that contains no chicken. It's just like chicken gravy. What this is really, if you just think about it for even a second too much, you realize it's pasta in gravy. >> But don't think >> it's gravy pasta is what this is. If if I said, ""Here's some spaghetti with gravy."" They'd take my kids away. But here it's they'd celebrate me. They're just big hunks of dough. It's amazing. Everything here tastes, you know, packaged and canned, but that's awesome. Sometimes sure wish it had some chicken in it. Seriously, there's no shrimp. Tastes super fake, but like the dumplings have a great chewy, dense texture. I love I loved them when I was a kid. I love them now. I thought it was so sophisticated, too, for some reason. I thought this was like really a grown-up adult. It's noodles in gravy. People are going to crucify me. Bad people, because they're ones who don't like uh uh Cracker Barrel, am I right, folks? I'm going to give this an eight. Even there's no chicken in it, I don't care. Next up, the handbredded fried chicken. It looks like it's got a really good crust on it. It feels crisp. It's got nice big craggly bits on it for a naked breast with no bones in it. Still pretty juicy. It has a nice texture to it. The crunch is there. It's kind of reminiscent of Burger King's chick, the way they deal with chicken, which is put way too much pepper in it, but in a way that I like. This is a big old breast. It can handle all that pepper. But what happens when I put gravy on it? Magic. Magic. Perfectly lovely. Um, I'm going to give the chicken a seven. Give a seven. It's really solid chicken. I shouldn't have given this an eight. My nostalgia is clouding my my chain. That's part of it. >> But I'm going to leave it. It's pure nostalgia, but I'm giving that an eight. I think it's solid fried chicken. All right. Next up, meatloaf. You know me, Babish fam. I got to go with that. Nice crust on the outside. Decent texture. I remember it being like chewy bordering on like mushoot bouncy. I I think they might have improved it actually. Like it tastes more like Well, damn it. It tastes like homemade meatloaf. I don't know what else to tell you, but it does. It's plenty moist. It's well seasoned. I'll give it a seven. That's solid meatloaf. I like that meatloaf. I could eat all of it and will and going to. There's only there's only 1,200 calories in this plate. Now for Brad's entree that I get to try first. Make sure it's not poison. We have chicken fried steak with some extraordinarily thick gravy. Like feel like that's too thick, guys. I feel like that's too thick. Babish, >> I thought it was mashed potatoes to be on top. >> No, same. Like it's it's it's like it's like paste. Like that's way too thick. Okay, we got ourselves some chicken fried steak. You can see that there is steak in there. It has indeed been chicken fried. This all smells like bacon. Gravy's too thick. It's really salty. First truly salty thing I've had here. The steak is pretty dry. You got the gravy on there, but the gravy is so thick that it was just becoming, you know, glop. It's becoming mush in my mouth. I've had very good country fried steak from the meat and freeze kind of places in Texas. Nothing fancy, nothing hoy toy. This doesn't hold a candle to like a proper chicken fried steak. That being said, overall, as a food item, it is tasty and I would eat more of it. I'll give it a six. I'm going to try the hash brown casserole first cuz it doesn't look very good. It doesn't look very good at all. feel. Oh, no. It's not good. >> That's terrible. Um, potatoes are gummy. The flavor, it tastes like boxed mashed potatoes, but it's whole potatoes. They found a way. I'm sure that they shredded and dried the potatoes, then they rehydrate them to make this. So, that's it's the same process. Probably why it tastes the same way. Mild bitter kind of back end to it that I'm not crazy about. I don't like any part of that. Also, on the outside, I thought it was crispy on the outside. It's not. It's dried and kind of gummy on the outside, too. I hate those. Those are terrible. Uh, let's try these grits. Oh, yeah. They need butter. What am I doing? I got to salt them, too, cuz they taste like water. Mash that all up in there. Yeah, it I'll take the butter. Better for sure. Once you add butter and salt, it's like you're eating corn and cob kind of a little bit flavor-wise. I mean, it's not bad. And it definitely still has like a grit texture to it. Like it's not overcooked to absolute mush. It's not doing anything special for me though. And I'm not a southerner. This isn't in my blood. I'm going to give it a five cuz I would just tolerate it personally. GB's. Hilarious. They're canned green beans. They hit them with a little bit of pork either flavor or they cook them with, you know, a pork hawk or something. There's a little bit of pork flavor in there. I think if I just came here for the first time, I'd give those a three because I've come here and ate those every time I came here. Five, maybe even a five. Macan cheese. And Brad and I were just commenting on this. I don't remember their mac and cheese being baked. There's evidence of it having been baked here. These brown bits like that is the corner of a pan. So, let's see if it's as good as I remember it and or better. Damn, it tastes really flat. Not cheesy at all. If they just squirted some mustard in here, it would taste cheesier. It's got like this chlorine flavor on the back end. Like, oh man, that sucks. My childhood. My memories. I'm going to eat it if I'm hungry. Nostalgia cuts both ways sometimes, you know. So, this guy's going to get a brief. I don't like this at all. All right, folks. That's our first Cracker Barrel stop. We're going to make plenty more cuz we are driving across the American South. and they're also in L50 states. So, you know, but that's where we're going. >> All right, folks. We're getting out of Dodge. And by Dodge, I mean Martha, Texas, and we are headed for Arizona. [Music] >> All right, Babage fam, you know what it is. It's Cracker Bell round two. Round two. Round two of three. So, join us, won't you? >> As we go exploring into the great beyond of the barrel of crackers. So, first up, campfire chicken. This is the tiniest little chicken right I've ever seen. That is a little tiny bird. I mean, the skin, there's nothing crispy about it because it was, you know, steamed in the wrapper. Let's see what this tastes like. Wow, it's so small and bony. It's nice and dipped in the campfire uh juices, and I got a nice piece of skin on there. Lots of herbs and seasonings. It's okay. I was genuinely expecting this to be awful. I don't like chicken skin that has been steamed and becomes rubbery and pull apart and I don't like it, but I was also expecting the chicken to be cooked to a pulp. And I would say it's halfway cooked to a pulp. I'm going to try some of the other stuff here. Carrots are totally cooked through. I was expecting these to be crunchy just by looking at them. They're not great, but they're not bad. They're they're they're very soft while not yet being soggy. They're a little water logged. Try some of these new potatoes. So, I really don't understand how you would actually make something like this over a campfire because there's so many different elements. Oh, I bit the fork. It's a damn fine potato. Actually, tomatoes and onions. I love the onions that are swimming around in the bottom. They taste like the onions from a pot roast they did in slow cooker. a little bit of tang to them, a little bit of oniony essence, but mostly they're just stew flavor. That is the corn. It's mushy in that like overcooked corn, but it still has like chew to it. Still has body and it tastes very sweet. That's a nice ear corn. Well, half ear. We'll be right back. Must have a hard time hearing me. It's only got a half ear. We'll be right back. I'm hyperventilating. Almost everything was better than I thought it was going to be, but none of it was terribly good. I would eat everything in here because I am very, very hungry right now. I would eat around a couple things, particularly the chicken skin. That's five. That's five. It's not bad. Next up, we have the beef. And you know me, Babish fam, you got to get up pretty early in the morning. Period. It seems to be quite tender. That's a relief. That's not bad at all. Primary flavor outside of beef is pepper and I actually kind of like it. It's like pepper steak. Super tender and it's not dry at all. It must have decent fat content because it's not dry. You know what it tastes? It tastes like pepper jerky. That flavor but obviously not that texture. So that's pretty good. I can't give this seven. Can I? Yeah. The corn's good. Yeah. I'm going to give I'm going to give it a seven. You me ain't nothing but a little bit of fire fish. This looks like a a a wing or something like a like a fish state wing or something like that. Let's get some tartar sauce in the mix. It's not the moistest fish in the world, but the flavor is really nice and neutral. The breading is relatively crispy. It's not fish fry breading. It's very much chicken fry breading. Like this is wet than dry breading for sure. The same way that you do chicken. But like it's good. It's just not like fish fry good. Like Friday night fish fry good. Six. If you're like, I need fresh fish fry right now or I'm going to set this car on fire. This will prevent you from setting the car on fire 100%. But it's it's it just doesn't have the essence of fish fry. I think both because of the breading and the fish that are dry. Try the mashed potatoes and gravy. Brown gravy. This is a misnomer because these are called mashed potatoes and they're not. They're smashed potatoes. What's the difference? I'm glad you asked. That was what I was waiting for was for you to ask that. You played right into my hand. You fell into my trap. Now I got you right where I want you. Mashed potatoes are smooth. Smashed potatoes are chunky. And I just want you to know being informed consumer before you walk in here and make an ass out of yourself. That's what these videos are all about. I make an ass out of myself so you don't have to. It has none of the um boxed mashed potato flavor. If I had said that it had boxed mashed potato flavor, you might think that's a dig, but it's very nostalgic for me. I like I like that it was never dehydrated. How about that? It's never dehydrated and or and rehydrated as such. And the gravy tastes like, you know, packaged gravy. Maybe not powdered gravy, but like jarred gravy. That's what it tastes like. So, one step above. Overall, very comforting side dish. chunks are a little too big for me. I can't give I'm going to give it a six because it is serviceable slightly above what I expected it to be. Last but not least, we have the turnip greens. So, I've never had turnup cranes, I don't think. And these look like they have pork hawk in there or some kind of pork. It looks really inviting. Like that's a good looking bowl. It tastes porky. Bit too watery for my taste. I've been told and I shall do, as the old saying goes. Little bit of Tabasco. That does help. I will say I don't like Tabasco. Um it's one of my least favorite hot sauces. It's bitter and sour. Works very well on here because then you get a progression of flavors. First all you taste is Tabasco and then that passes and you get turnip greens and a little bit of the pork and those flavors really complement each other nicely. And I like the progression. I do. All that you said, they're pretty mushy. They're pretty watery. The pork tastes like pork, but it's like doesn't taste like slaughtered uh last week or even last year. I don't I don't know. It's very dry. The pork has been cooked within an inch of its life. >> But it's dead. >> But it's dead. We give another six. Sorry. Got to keep giving sexes. Cornbread. It's a requirement for human life. Or so I've been told here in the South. Has a nice crisp exterior to it. Nice like, you know, sort of firm outside. Definitely crisp. That kicks the out of their biscuits. It's good and salty. Has a distinct corn flavor. A bit of grit to it. Like it has a little bit of corn grit to it. The outside is lightly crisp and the inside is nice and fluffy. Tastes one step higher than like a good box. Not jiffy. Look at this. It's solid. So, we have ourselves the s'mor. There's a brownie under there, dude. There we go. It's everything. All the flavors of some more but with a brownie and ice cream. I think I'd rather have this than an actual samore. Ah, never mind. That's crazy. That's crazy. I'm not going to measure this against a samore, even though it is in and of itself a I have to. I guess. Why do I have to judge everything? This is amazing. This is amazing. It's everything you love about s'more with brownie and some ice cream in front of her. Brown is hot and full of chocolate chunks. Fudgy and a little tiny bit chip. 10. Perfect. No. Love this. It's the best. Now we have the cinnamon roll. I love cinnamon rolls with a white gooey passion. I have a very hard time imagining that they're not going to stick the landing on us. The goo is nice and gooey. the like there's there there's so much cinnamon goo back in here. Look, that's all just cinnamon goo. You don't get that with a cinnamon roll. You only get what you're given. Just a big pile of cinnamon sugar. It's just with with butter presumably. 10. It's perfect. 10's all the way down. Did we have desserts the last one? >> No. >> No, we didn't. We haven't didn't have dessert. That's why my eyes are now open. They knock desserts out of the park so far. Like unbelievable. I love these. And they're perfect for just one person. Wait, I don't get any. >> Did you order one? >> No. Well, I thought we were going to share. Share a cinnamon roll uh skillet. Clearly, you've never been to Cracker Barrel. We'll be right back. [Music] All right, we are back at the Cracker Barrel. Part Twah. So, the Cracker Bills we went to a little loud. Uh, and they're all exactly the same. Maybe the most identical business in existence. Uh, so we want to try something different. We're picking up curbside and we're going to find a nice little picnic spot to eat it in the great out ofdoors. We'll just look for a spot to pull over and grab a bite. We have a onemile hike to the uh viewing spot and apparently a picnic area. And as you can see, we brought ourselves a little picnic lunch. Four entre and desserts and a whole bunch of sides from the Cracker Barrel. Oh god. Oh no. >> What? There better be utensils in here, man. >> Well, we're going to eat like animals. >> Yeah, I guess so. I'm going to get like a leaf and scoop with it. You get used to this. If this is what hiking's like, sign me up. We're Let's eat this with sticks. Even if there's utensils. A little bit of adventure and a willingness. A willingness to experiment with each other. >> Yeah. >> And phallic shaped objects. >> And phallic shaped. Look at this forest full of dicks. Look at all these penises, guys. Lude. They shouldn't bring kids here. I do feel the need to point out we are carrying a huge amount of detritus into a national park. Brad and I are former Boy Scouts. In Brad's case, former Weeble. I made it to Star Scout and we plan to both carry in, carry out, and leave it better than we found it. They ever shave your balls? >> No, that wasn't that wasn't part of it for me. >> They told me that was the the graduation ceremony. >> Huh? >> I love it out here, Babish. I'm going to get to these bags. Oh my god. Unquestionably the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. I have no I've never seen anything like that. Nothing comes close. Oh my god. [Music] There's a reason people say they're speechless when they come here. [Music] It's like it's everything. I wish everybody could see this, you know? It just makes you feel really small in the best way cuz everything feels so important sometimes. And you see this and you just get reminded how you're just a little blink. Let's see some croc barrel. [Music] Honestly, this feels so stupid now. I feel so dumb. This is the most majestic thing I've ever seen. And I'm standing here with a couple bags of Cracker Barrel like a real YouTuber. [Music] Hey, what's in here? Oh, thank God. Oh, thank God. Brad really wanted me to do this with my hands. And I told him that's putting a hat on a hat. We're at the Grand Canyon and I'm eating with my hands. Wo! These biscuits are different. They look different. They feel different. They like soaked these in butter. There's butter. They It's like they put them in a pool of butter. These are way better than the last ones. Wow. >> Hell yeah. >> The Grand Canyon really is magical. First up, steak fre. Those onions looked genuinely dank. It was weird enough to rag Cracker Barrel in Cracker Barrel, much less, you know, here. I specified the steak be cooked medium. I wouldn't call it medium, but there's pink in there. >> Okay. Cracker Barrel. >> Yeah. This one's for America. It tastes like the steak that you get at the supermarket in the white styrofoam, you know? It's not high quality beef, but it's not bad either. Like, it's just fine. It's pretty flavorless. Uh, lowfat content. Decent browning on there. They put some real char on there. Impressed by that. And the gravy and onions make it kind of nice. This is insane. Let's try the fries. They're obviously not crisp anymore. I imagine when those were crisp, they were really, really good. I think without the gravy it would be a five. With the gravy it's a six. Gravy is an upgrade. Without the gravy it's just the most average piece of beef in the world. So I think that's fair. So this is the hash brown crust shephardd's pie. So this is the hash browns that I didn't particularly like with what looks like a lot of cheese on top and then a shephardd's pie which really it's cottage pie because shephardd's pie is lamb and this is beef. So really it's cottage pie. And that sounds more Cracker Barrel to me if I'm being honest. I was not a big fan of these uh these potatoes. So, let's see how they are with just a bunch of cheese on them. I still have that bouncy almost gummy gummy texture. They have a they have a very bad texture. It's whole chunks of beef. I've never seen a shephardd's pie with huge steak tips in it. Roughly the same steak that was in the campfire meals. same quality of beef, like pretty neutral flavor, decent fat content, relatively tender. The gravy, I think, is the same gravies over there. It's the same glossy brown gravy, tastes very much the same. And then there's just vegetables in there that are, you know, very neutral flavored. They taste like they might have been canned before they were put in here. I would give it a five for those aspects, but then this crust is its undoing. So, I'm going to I'm going to give this a three. truly don't like that crust and there's no reason I would ever order this as a result. All right, next up I need something a little lighter, a little easier. So, I got a fruit cup. So, I'm going to take a big old hunk of this weird cut cut of pineapple. Never seen one like that before. Get away from me. So, I think that they make the fruit salad at the beginning of the day and there it sits. I think I don't know. Also, this was in the car for 3 hours. I don't know. Strawberries are pretty mush, which is not a result of sitting in here. It's a result of overripe strawberries. The blueberries I'm not even going to try because they're utter mush. Oh, here I found one that's halfway. That's a blueberry. And that's fruit. So, as far as a fruit cocktail goes, I've had so much worse. And from nicer places. There's no melon in here at all. That buys you some points. I love melon, but the odds that you're going to get ripe, soft melon in here, very low. It's all fresh fruit. Assuming that it suffered from sitting here for 3 hours, I'm going to I'm going to whatever score I give this, I'm going to give it another point. So, my instinct is to give this a six. There's decent fruit in here, but there's a bunch of, you know, mush mash, and I would eat the majority of this. So, that means give it a seven. It's fruit. All right, it's getting bright out. Uh the table's getting warm enough that uh this is warm now on the bottom, these ribs. And speaking of ribs, that's what these are. This is their Saturday special St. Louis style ribs. There's so many S's. I can see why they saw fit to put it on Saturday. Let's see what we got with the sauce. H. That's not what I was expecting. I was expecting Casey Masterpiece. This is sweeter, smokier. I'm sure they're using liquid smoke. So, we're off to a good start. What am I doing? I'm sorry you had to see me almost do that. So, a a sign of good ribs is that, you know, it's not falling off the bone. Yep. That was just No, that was just a little segment hanging on. A little tough. Uh-uh. That's odd. The sauce is so nice. And then I can see under the sauce there's some kind of spice paste right there. You see that? I think it has Old Bay in it or something. It tastes bizarre. It tastes like the oven ribs that I made in college once. Once. I don't like those one bit. They're a little too tough. And the spice mix, whatever they put on there. I'm pretty sure it's old bay. And it just makes it taste weird. And I probably have some bias built in cuz I was so mad when I made those ribs and how bad they turned out cuz I was a child and I didn't have money to buy ribs. Give them a four. They don't taste like they just taste. So that's a four. Next up, we have the pot roast. I'm wondering if this is just the base of the shephardd's pie. Carrots. There's onions in here. I don't see. Yeah, this is absolutely just the base of the shepherd's pie. Yeah, I see why they do it. I get it. I doubt there's many like me going in there and being like, ""This isn't shepherd's pie. This isn't even cottage pie."" I guess that's right. It's dumb. Confirmed. That's the same thing. Gotcha. I thought I was slipping one past me, but no. I think when I had the shephardd's pie, I said that the stew on its own would be like a five. Uh, and if I said otherwise, I was wrong because now I'm just trying the stew on its own. And guess what? I You're wrong. Me. All right. Next up, we have the loaded baked potato, which has big pieces of real bacon in it and some nice lumpy sour cream. That sour cream, it almost tastes like like it's been hanging out in the back of a car for like 3 hours. Wish I didn't bite eat that honestly cuz it's lumpy. I'm sure it's fine. It's just curdled. Like it's not it's not like poisonous. It's just curdled and that sucks. Here's what I can tell you. That's bacon on there. That's cheddar on there. And when that sour cream wasn't sitting in the back of a hot car, it was just sour cream. So, it is a very functional uh loaded baked potato. Give it a nine. It's a loaded baked potato. Do I have any joy in me? Fried okra. A Brad classic because Brad's from the south. Oh, it's soft. A It's soft. Oh. Oh. Okay. I think it's a cornmeal breading cuz they kind of remind me of fried green tomatoes. When they were crisp, I'm sure they were good. The flavor is just fine. Tastes like okra. It needs a sauce or something, but I didn't see any sauces in the bag. When it was I'm trying to imagine it crispy. Probably like oily, bursty. Yeah. I mean, I think that would be pretty pretty good. If it had a remalot, I'd give it an eight, I think, as I imagine it to be. I'd give it a seven. I'm sure it's a lovely side dish. So, next up, let's see if hash browns can be rescued by turning them into tater tots. Oh, they're mushy. Oh, they're like creamy in there. I think they might put some mashed potato in there as well. Make them a little fritters. I think they add onions. And the frying must help as well, but somehow somewhat. Those taste significantly better. Forget the texture. And there's there's more to it. There's more happening. I'm sure that these are crisp when they're sold for legal tender if they are crispy at all. Give them nine. Like those taste really good. I can't recommend what we're doing here today. I mean I Yeah, sure. Come out here. But maybe, you know, get there's McDonald's right down the road. All right. Next up, we have fried onion petals, which I was fully expecting a bloom and onion given the petal flower reference, but instead they are just the petals of That's still crispy. Not really crispy, but it's still a little crispy. >> Well, that's delightful. It's just onion rings, but not rings. It's just onion straits. It's just onion bites instead of rings. >> You might say petals. >> Petals. Onion petals. That's That's good. They should call them that. It tastes exactly like a high quality onion ring. It's still a little crispy, which leads me to believe, especially looking at the crust. Look at the crust on this. It's super bubbly. I have to imagine that this was incredible when made fresh. I don't even have to. I will. And I'm going to 10. It's a snackable onion ring. Fried apple time. This is the thing I would get each and every time I would go to Cracker Barrel. Get mac and cheese, fried apples, and chicken dumplings. It's so gorgeous. I forgot we were here because it's so gorgeous. Sorry. I think I did that when I was a kid. That felt very familiar. Yeah. So, this was my childhood favorite and it's every bit as good as I remember it. They leave the skins on, which is different unless that's what you normally do, in which case it's the same, right? It adds more structure to the apple, which is kind of nice. It makes it feel a little bit more homemade, but then the sauce makes it feel deeply not homemade. It's super gloppy and gelatinous and and very clearly thickened with cornstarch cuz it's so glossy. But damn, they're tasty. They have a weird little bitterness on the end. I almost feel like they use too much cinnamon, if that's even possible. They're not perfect. Nothing is. They're not a 10. I mean, it's just apple pie filling without the crust, so it's healthy. It's a nine, even with my nostalgia giving me a back rub with my shirt off. Next up, we have the peach cobbler, which looks pretty promising. Honestly, that looks like two shortbread cookies on top of some peach goo. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Now it's a real peach cobbler. I had to put the whole cookies on there. So, you can do that, I guess. Whoa, they're big old peaches. Look at the size of this peaches. Brad and I are getting a little punchy. These might even be canned peaches. I don't care. They're so sweet and they just taste like peach. They almost taste fake, but they're not. They're peaches. Like, unless they 3D printed those, we're not there yet. Or canned peach pie filling. That's exactly what this tastes like. So, let's try the whole thing all together. It's pie crust. So, it's they they take chunks of pie crust, they bake it in squares, and then they put it on top. That makes sense. I wish it was shortbread because that would be you'd get a 10. Honestly, you'd get a 10 if this was shortbread. I got to at least give it a nine. To be out here eating this in the height of the the beginning of summer, the Grand Canyon, and eating peach cobbler from Cracker Barrel. I'll say this cuz I mean it. This is once in a lifetime experience. I doubt I'm going to do this again. I sincerely doubt it. I hope in fact that I don't do this again. Next and last, the double fudge chocolate coke cake or Coca-Cola cake. Coke cake doesn't sound right. There's no way they call this Coke cake. Just single layer. It's just cake with soap frosting on it. And it's made with Coca-Cola. I guess it feels good. I don't taste anything resembling Coke in there. Cake's dry and crumbly. The the frosting is chocolate frosting, so it's a, you know, one of the best substances on earth. It just tastes like canned chocolate frosting. So, it's wonderful and I love it. And it's a good thing there's a solid 2 cm of it because uh I wouldn't eat this cake otherwise. I'll tell you that much. You know how everybody doesn't like plain cake? We're all in it for the frosting except those weirdos. I had an ex once who would eat the cake ou",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 of like she would leave the shell top and side. Like I said, an X. I mean, you know what it tastes? It tastes like, you know, a chocolate sheetcake from the g. Not as good, though, cuz the chocolate she cakes from the grocery store have a density to them usually cuz they're refrigerated. I'm sure this was, but like it's just so so fall apart crumbly. See, that cake shouldn't do that. That sucks. I want it to be like a brownie almost. I want it to be the most dense crazy cake. And I want it to taste like Coke a little bit. All that to be said, it's still a chocolate cake that is like not disgusting. Oh, it dissipates towards the edges. Look at how little there is towards the edges. Never mind. Six. There was just some heavy frosting in the bits that I bit. So, that's it, folks. Bet you didn't see this coming. Frankly, neither did we, if I'm being honest. thought of this in the shower this morning. We were coming to the to to the Grand Canyon anyway, just me and Brad. We weren't going to bring cameras. We were just going to enjoy ourselves, which we are. We're still enjoying ourselves. But I was like," """"Dude"," what if?"""" And we went to we went to the crack Cracker Barrel of Flagstaff and we drove it here and we walked past other strangers carrying two big shopping bags of Cracker Barrel and we endured that shame and the continued shame of people walking by seeing whatever it is we're doing here. And I'm very glad that we did. Insane. I I don't I can't believe I'm doing a ranking at the mouth of the Grand Canyon. When I went out on that outcropping", I I started to tear up a little bit. Uh both because of just the sheer majesty of what we're seeing. I mean, it's it's it's lifechanging. But also because I'm just so so so grateful that you guys have made this my job, that I can do something this silly and personally breathtaking, and you guys will will, you know, watch along with us and have a good time with us. and you've made this our livelihoods. We're on a road trip across the country. And we got to see one of the seven wonders of the natural world. And we got to eat the Cracker Barrel three times. It's pretty special. So, I really," really mean this when I say it. Thank you. Thank you. Cracker Barrel. Call the Cracker Barrel.

gpSV_oavvyY,"Hello there. Welcome back to another episode of Anything with Alvin. Now, this one is going to be a fun one. I wanted to do a little experiment of some sort where you make chocolate chip cookies, but only change one variable to see how it kind of affects the way the cookie turns out. As someone who loves chocolate chip cookies and tweaking, optimizing every single little aspect of it to make it a better cookie, this is something I've actually wanted to do for quite some time. A lot of towns people have done this on a different scale. There's pictures of, you know, grids of different cookies, but I kind of wanted to go through as many as I possibly could and record the video process of how it all went down. Yeah. Anyway, we have a lot of chocolate, got a lot of dark brown sugar, flour, and butter. Now, let's lay down some ground rules. The control recipe, the base recipe that I will be using to compare everything to is the Toll House recipe. It's on the back of almost every bag they have. You can easily find it online. It's a very solid standard base cookie recipe that'll give you a chocolate chip cookie that will do the job and it doesn't require any crazy ingredients. This is going to be the base cookie or the control recipe that we're modifying one aspect at a time towards. So, the control recipe goes as follows. In a mixer, I'm taking one stick of softened butter, creaming it with 75 g of granulated sugar, 75 g of dark brown sugar, and then adding in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, one large egg. And after that's all mixed in, I'm going to add in 135 g of allpurpose flour, half a teaspoon of salt, half a teaspoon of baking soda, and then 1 cup of chocolate chips. Pretty standard. You probably know someone or you've made this recipe yourself. Once the dough is mixed, it goes into a bowl to chill for about an hour or so, just until it's not super warm. Once that's all ready, they get scooped out on mediumsiz ice cream soups onto a tray and into an oven at 350° for about 17 to 20 minutes, depending on your oven. That is our standard recipe. And once these come out of the oven, this is your classic looking chocolate chip cookie. Couple of ripples, kind of a golden brown outside with a softer white inside, chocolate chip studded throughout. Nothing to complain about. This will do the job any day of the week. If you want a cookie, then you could easily bring this recipe to anywhere you want. I've done it many times. The standard chocolate chip cookie flavor that you probably already can imagine, but nothing too crazy complex about it. So, what I wanted to do was run a bunch of different kinds of tests, testing every single aspect of this cookie that I could probably think of. And so, let us begin. The original one uses chocolate chips. I wanted to test it compared to chocolate chunks versus chopped bar chocolate, which are two actually very different things. Chocolate chunks are the ones you find in the bags that are in chunk form. And chopped chocolate is when you take bars of chocolate and you chop it up yourself. So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to make a control batch of dough. And while that's going in the mixer, I'm going to chop up some semieet dark chocolate bars, giving uneven texture. So, we both have little shards, big chunks, and that tiny chocolate dust that inevitably piles up when you chop up a bar of chocolate, cuz that does actually make a difference in your final cookie, I think. Okay, so how I did this was I took the amount of dough that we made inside the mixer that has no chocolate. Remember that. I weighed it and I divide it in half between two bowls. And between the two bowls, first I'm going to add in the chopped chocolate. Taking all of that and mixing until it's evenly incorporated. Not trying to overm mix it because I don't want the dough to get tight. I'm trying to keep as many variables as I can the same. Obviously, there's going to be differences and slight temperatures and how many times I mixed it, but hopefully we'll be able to see some pretty significant results that these little inconsistencies won't actually make a difference. Once the chopped chocolate dough is ready, I'm going to now combine the chocolate chunks that were bought again at the store into our controlbased dough. and also give that a mix in a similar amount of time. The bowl on the left is the chocolate chip cookie dough with chocolate that has been chopped up from the bar. And the bowl on the right consists of not chocolate chips, but chocolate chunks that were bought at the store. These do have a little bit of a coating, but they're closer to more like chocolate chunks than the chocolate chips are because the chocolate chips have a lot more of the sugar and the coating to make them not stick. And hopefully we'll see that in the baking results. So once these doughs are chilled again for about an hour to two hours, going to scoop these out onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. And as you can already see, the one on the left is the chopped chocolate. The one on the right is the chunk chocolate. And because of the little chocolate powder and shards, the dough is clearly a little bit darker on the left side. There's probably going to be more chocolate flavor imparted into the dough. But already we're seeing a huge visual difference by not using chocolate chips. The one on the right, the chocolate chunks we bought at the store, don't have that shard and that dust, so they're going to look similar to the control base. All right. And after these bake for about 18 minutes, we have our comparisons ready. So on the right on that isolated sheet of parchment paper are two control cookies. The normal toll house cookie recipe just there for comparison. In the middle we have our chopped chocolate cookies and on the left we have our chocolate chunk cookies. Now the visual differences are pretty striking right off the bat. The one in the middle has a lot more of these smaller flexcks of chocolate, a little bit darker throughout compared to the chocolate chunks. It definitely looks a little bit more quote unquote artisan and it does take a little bit more extra work. The chocolate chunk one is clearly more like the control cookie where none of the chocolate kind of really incorporates into the dough, but you do get larger sections where it's just chocolate. So, compared to chocolate chips, it's almost less interspersed out, but once you get a bit, there's going to be more of it. So tearing these open again with the chopped chocolate, you can see the chocolate is a little bit more interspersed throughout in different kinds of textures. Sometimes little tiny flexcks, sometimes larger pools, and also because we're chopping chocolate that hasn't been coated with too many preservatives, there's going to be a lot more melting and pooling of chocolate cuz a lot of these chocolate chunks and chips have anti-coagulants on the surface, which help them not, you know, stick together in the bag, but not necessarily the best for baking, but they do retain their shape after baking. Flavor-wise, the chopped chocolate is way better. You can kind of taste more of the real chocolate flavor. This is the kind of cookie you probably have to pay five bucks for, whereas the other ones are maybe around the $2 or $3 range at the bakery. I definitely prefer the middle one. It is how I've been personally making my chocolate chip cookies for years. But it's really nice to see them side by side, but there's nothing wrong with the classic. And if you're going to spend a little bit more money on chocolate for your chocolate chip cookie, I would recommend going for good bar chocolate that you can just chop up because the texture and color are going to be instantly more significant. The next test we will be doing sugars. This one we're going to be comparing brown sugar only versus white sugar only. Obviously compared to our control. So this procedure is pretty similar. Just make each control batch except instead of brown sugar and white sugar being in equal quantities in the control recipe. We're just going to be using exclusively one or the other. So doubling each one in each recipe and using none of the other. These are the doughs after they've been made. Obviously the brown sugar one is a lot more brown and the white sugar one is a lot more white. And the sky is blue. Yes. All right. Same procedure. Let's get these doughs in the fridge, chill them, scoop them out, bake them, and compare them. White sugar one is clearly in the middle. And that you you get it at this point. You could probably tell. Let's get to the examination and the tasting. So, the white sugar one spread a lot and they have zero color on it. It really does not look like an appetizing cookie whatsoever. Uh, really spread a lot. I think that's just because white sugar compared to brown sugar does not have molasses. And molasses is a little bit stickier and white sugar will just melt and spread. And also because without the addition of molasses, there's less water. And when there's water in a cookie, the water will kind of almost activate the gluten in the flour a little bit more, causing it to hold on to itself just a little bit. So the brown sugar one is a lot tighter compared to the control. It's definitely a little smaller and circular size and definitely darker. And when you break it open, it's very soft and chewy because of the molasses. It's not only darker, but it has more water content. So, it kind of has a little bit more of a cake- like texture because of the water addition in the molasses. When you break these apart, the white one almost just crumbles in your hand in a soft and not a good way. There's like no structure on this thing. The brown one is definitely chewier and softer. And when it comes to the taste test, uh, Nico will now sub in. So, he said that the flavor is not very deep. It's not very complex. And the texture is quote wispy. falls apart instantly and didn't really like it, which made a lot of sense. There's no depth of flavor and it just tastes like white sugar. I think that was actually the biggest difference I realized is just that without the brown sugar, a chocolate chip cookie does not have that signature chocolate chip cookie flavor at all. It just tastes like chocolate chips with sugar, which is technically what it kind of is, but which is really lacking whatever the molasses doing to the flavor of the cookie after it's been baked. I will say though, there is merit in having both sugars. The control was definitely my preferred one out of the three because if it was only brown sugar, it almost was a little too chewy and and wet in a not great way. I think having both really does make sense in terms of both balancing flavor, texture, and visual appeal. So, I'll be sticking to using both sugars. There definitely makes a lot of sense here. There probably could have been a lot of tests we could have ran with coconut sugars and stuff like that, but how about we run a test with sugar substitutes? We're going to be testing making chocolate chip cookies with honey and comparing that with maple syrup. So, we're going to make each dough, but instead we're going to be substituting the honey and the maple syrup. And it seemed like you had to use about 3/4 of the amount of the sugar required in volume as we use the liquid sweeteners because liquid sweeteners have a higher density of sugar pervolen because the sugars are dissolved. Now, obviously the concern is because of the liquid in honey and maple syrup. I was very curious to see how they would bake up compared to normal and if they would be an acceptable substitute in a pinch. Here's the dough with maple syrup. Here's a dough with honey. Definitely a lot lighter in color. Again, after chilling and scooping out, let's bake it and give it a se. The one in honey is on the left. The one with only maple syrup is in the middle. From the looks of it, I really understand why these are not acceptable substitutes in chocolate chip cookies. The extra water content makes them really puffy. They almost look like muffins. and muffin tops. They're really spongy and bready. I really don't like that. The maple syrup one definitely puffed more and brown less because it had more water. I think the honey one browned more than the maple syrup because the honey has less water compared to maple syrup, which makes sense. If you pick it up and tear it open, it really does feel like those muffin top. Almost like those muffin top snacks you buy at Costco. It's a lot spongy. It's very bready. If you gave someone and told this was a cookie, they'd be like, ""Ooh, I don't know. I don't know about that one. I might not trust your dessert decisions in the future."" If you don't call it a cookie though, I think it's fine. Like Rachel said, it's not a cookie, but if you don't say it's a cookie, it's totally fine. If you tell someone it's like a chocolate chip muffin top or, you know, chocolate chip loaf uh thing, then I think that's totally acceptable. The also interesting thing is the maple syrup doesn't actually have a noticeable flavor after it's been baked. I think the maple syrup flavor is actually more of a aroma that kind of gets lost. But the honey one is a very strong flavor and aroma because honey itself, I think, is very, very, very powerful in flavor. So, it does really taste like honey. I guess if you do like that, then sure. But I would not recommend doing this if you wanted the texture and the appeal of a normal chocolate chip cookie. Because of the extra water content, it really messes up with the way that this works. However, if you wanted to make chocolate chip muffin tops in a pinch and you like that spongier, breierier texture, then by all means use the standard to household recipe. Do 3/4 of what they asked for in sugar in maple syrup or honey and you'll get exactly what this is. All right, that was a fun test. The next test we are testing leavveners. Now, the original recipe only has a/ teaspoon of baking soda. But I wanted to see if you, you know, maybe sometimes you don't have baking soda. You can definitely substitute baking soda for baking powder. That's a pretty common thing. Just do a 3:1 ratio. But also, how would the chocolate chip cookie look like if you just completely omitted it? I feel like often times when we bake, we follow recipes, but we're not really sure if this little tiny addition of something is going to make a difference. So, let's find out. I made a control batch according to the toll house recipe except there was no baking soda in the batch. I split that batch in two and in half of it I added triple the amount of baking powder to baking soda cuz that's usually how it's converted. So, in this case 1 and 1/2 teaspoons and in the other half batch I added no leavenner. So, the only difference between these two is the addition of baking powder. As expected, they look the same. I don't think a leavenvener is going to make a visual or cosmetic difference instantly off the bat. I think that'll come out after baking. So once these go into the fridge, rest for two hours, scooped out again on a tray into the oven, they look the same, but when they come out, the results are very, very, very different. So on the right again, we have our control cookies. Very standard recipe. In the middle are the cookies with no leavenner whatsoever. And on the left are the cookies with only baking powder. The one with no leavenner is just stark white. There is no browning on this whatsoever. It's also got this weird crackly like webbed texture to the outside which usually means the cookie recipe wasn't adjusted properly for ratios. And it looks like the one with baking powder only spread out a little bit more and brown a little bit more around the edges compared to the control. The one with no lavender clearly looks like we forgot something which in this case we intentionally did. So there is a reason why you know baking powder helps with a cookie. It adds the puffiness while it bakes. It's a little bit more even and gets those nice ripples that you want rather than just dough that's sugared out and just just baking in the oven. Clearly the baking powder one is better to the no leavener visually, but it also does look like the baking soda got browner, which I think is something that baking soda does. Baking soda is commonly added to things in, you know, meat dishes or even like pork to get it crispy and browning. Even wings, I think it has something to do with pH. And I think when you add baking powder, which is just baking soda plus cornstarch, the cornstarch kind of gets in the way of whatever the baking soda does. So, it makes sense that the baking powder one is slightly less golden brown than the control, which is just baking soda. From a eating perspective, uh I would not recommend low no leavenner at all. It's just very dense and weird. It doesn't really feel like a cookie when you eat. It feels very kind of crunchy, but soft and dense and not really good. The one with the baking powder definitely tastes more like a cookie. So, that was a fun one. I I really like seeing the differences between those. Nico taste tested this one, too, and I I think he he also agreed he really did not like the No Levener one. Next is a pretty simple one. It is a temperature baking test. So, for this one, I'm testing baking it at 300 versus baking it at 350, which is our control, and baking it at 400° Fahrenheit. Let's just see how it affects it. So, we're taking our control dough. We already have our controls baked, so we're just going to bake one batch at 300° and the other batch at 400°. They're going to be slightly adjusted baking times because we do want to make sure that they do get cooked through. So, the 400°ree one we cooked for about 3 minutes less and 300°ree one we cooked for about 5 minutes more. So, 300°ree one ended up going for about 24 minutes and the 400°ree one took about 13 minutes. And here are the results. Again, the control is on the right side, 350°. Our 300°ree cookie is in the middle. Our 400 degree cookie is on the left as expected. 300 degrees because it's cooking at a slower temperature has more time to spread. Definitely browns a little bit less and is a little bit more even overall because we gave it 23 minutes in the oven cuz that's how long it took for the center to be ready. Now the 400°ree one because it's so hot, it cooks a lot faster. So the dough doesn't have much time to spread. So the circle is a little bit smaller. It's a little bit thicker and the edges have a contrast in brownness compared to the middle. So, I guess the 300°ree one kind of looks like the cookie you might find, you know, at any bakery that has one, but maybe they didn't make it themselves and they just bought it, outsourced it, and that's fine. It's still good. And the 400°ree one is something that might, you know, people might want to reach for and go, ""Ooh, that looks a little bit more delicious."" There's definitely a stronger golden brown appeal to this one, but I would say that none of them are bad at all. It's just a little bit different for everyone. 300 degrees is for someone who likes a really soft chocolate chip cookie flavor that's almost like cookie dough because there's less of the browning flavor in it. The 400°ree one has almost two unique different textures. The outside is thicker, crustier chocolate chip cookie baked flavor and the inside's a little bit more soft again like cookie dough. So, if you want a cookie that almost tastes like two cookies, I would say go for 400°, but make sure you don't burn it. And if you just want a larger cookie that's just really, really, really, really soft and you just want the flavor of cookie dough that's still cooked, go for 300°. And if you kind of want a little bit of both, go for 350. You know, just like IGN said, a little something for everyone. All right, next up, we are testing butters. One of them is going to use melted butter instead of room temperature butter, and the other one is going to use brown butter, a personal and crowd favorite when it comes to making chocolate chip cookies. Every time I make a dessert, including cookies, I'm browning the butter. And I know why. But I do want to see them compared side by side. So, we have the same amount of butter in each recipe. One's been microwaved until it's melted and one has been browned in the pan uh without any additional moisture addition back. So, we're going to make doughs the exact same recipe. The only difference is how the butter was made. Two batches in the stand mixer. Same as usual. And we have our two doughs ready. On the left is our brown butter chocolate chip cookie dough. You can already probably tell it's darker and it smells a lot more aromatic than the one on the right, which is our melted butter cookie dough. Maybe you don't even have a stand mixer. You don't want to have the time to soften your butters. You just melt in the microwave. I think this is an important test to see if that's worth it or if it's going to make a big of a difference at all. Again, these doughs go into the fridge to chill for 2 hours, get scooped out on a medium ice cream scoop onto a tray of parchment paper into the oven, 350°, 17 to 18 minutes until they are ready. And here are the results. The melted butter chocolate chip cookies are probably the same color as the control ones. As expected, the brown butter chocolate chip cookies are a little bit deeper in color. And I will say the brown butter also has less spreading because the brown butter does not have the water of the other ones because once you brown the butter, the 15 to 20% water inside butter completely evaporates. So there's less room for the sugar to dissolve, therefore less spreading in your cookie. Flavor-wise, the brown butter wins. There's so much more aromatic and complexity go on. But I think the biggest and most interesting thing is comparing the melted butter to the control which is just softened butter. The melted butter tastes exactly the same as the control version, but it's just denser because if you melt the butter, you're losing a little bit of the air that was in it. You want a puffier, airier cookie, go for soft. If you want a denser, chewier cookie, I would say melted. Just make sure the melted butter is not too hot when you add it to everything else. Otherwise, it can melt the chocolate. All right, this one is a fun one. How about let's test 50% additional chocolate chips versus 100% additional. So double the chocolate in a chocolate chip cookie recipe just to see how it turns out. Is there such thing as too much chocolate? We're probably going to find out with this one. Now, you know, everybody likes the chocolate chips in a cookie, right? When you look at a cookie, you get excited because there's more chocolate chips than you expected. It feels like a win when you can like excavate a chunk of chocolate out of a thing of cookie. Even the whole thing is yours. Anyway, we don't need to talk about my uh vices. So, we're going to make the recipe exact same as the control except for one of the batches. We're going to increase the chocolate chips by 50%. And then the next one, we're going to increase it by 100%. So, double the chocolate chips added. And you know, when you take out the dough and put it in the bowls, surprisingly, they look kind of similar. So, again, into the fridge, chill, scoop, bake. Let's see how these turn out. Okay, there's a little bit of a difference if you can't tell. The control recipe is on the right. The 100% double chocolate is in the middle and the 50% chocolate is in the left. For the 50% one has a little bit more ripples and when you, you know, pick it up, it's very sturdy. It's very sturdy. You might think, oh, you're increasing the chocolate, increasing the fat, it should be a lot softer and melt. But I think because chocolate chips are technically not the same as bar chocolate, there's a lot more sugar and anti-coagulant coating on these. It'll actually make the structure of the cookie a lot more sturdy than your typical chocolate chip cookie. So increasing the chocolate chips will increase the sturdiness. They got some structure to them. The one double one, the 100% more chocolate chips is extremely sturdy. This thing feels like a melee weapon. It's probably got a durability counter that's higher than I don't know Link's Master Sword. So let's compare the cross-section. The 50% increase in chocolate is on the top. The double chocolate is on the bottom. 100% increase. And you know when you break it open, you eat it, it's like eating the words chocolate chip cookie except those first two words are in caps lock and the second one is a parenthesis that's you know like a like a like a subtext you got to read at the bottom of the page or something like you're just eating basically chocolate chips which is not a bad thing. If you love the taste of chocolate chips and chocolate chip cookies and you kind of hunt for them, you're going to like this cookie. You just don't really get that like cookie from the flour and the sugar and the egg and the brown flavor of the cookie. You just get more of the chocolate flavor. That's pretty much it. If you love chocolate chips, throw in 50% more. Throw in double. And I think that's totally fine. Nobody's going to be mad that there's a lot of chocolate in their cookie. They don't want chocolate in their cookie. They might might as well just go to jail. All right. Our next test is going to be using solely bread flour versus solely cake flour compared to the classic, which is allpurpose flour. If you don't happen to know this, bread flour has a higher protein content, which means it's better suited for bread because it's chewier and it has more strength to it. Cake flour has less protein in it, which is why it's best designed for cakes and pastries. It's more airy and more chance of it being soft and more crumbly. So, those are the two main differences. Allpurpose flour is kind of a mix, which is why it's called allpurpose. Like IGN said, a little bit of something for everybody. But, let's see if it's worth going one directional or the other. Here they are. Breaking these open. The bread one is a little bit tighter in terms of crumb. If you like a chewier, more dense cookie, you're going to like using only bread flour. And personally, I like a chewier, denser cookie because there's really not much else holding it together besides a tiny bit of water from the egg and the vanilla extract. Compared to the control, the cake flour has a little bit more ripples, which makes sense because there's less gluten to kind of tighten up on the way, so it's going to spread out and kind of be crispier and airier like it should be. But if you want to make a Tate style cookie that's thinner and crispier, you should go for all cake flour. I think it does actually make a pretty noticeable difference in the final result. Choosing a different flour that might be a little bit more expensive will make a difference that you can notice. Okay, our next test is going to be testing only egg yolks and comparing that to only egg whites. Now, for one recipe, instead of using one egg, we're going to use three egg yolks to substitute that. That'll hopefully make up the same amount of liquid quantity as the one egg. And in the other one, we're going to use only egg whites. We're going to use about one to two egg whites, depending on how big they are, but I try to measure them by weight and make sure that it was the same. So, we kind of ended up between 1 and 1/2 and two. As you could probably expect, the color difference is pretty noticeable. The egg whites one is a lot whiter and the egg yolks one is a lot more deep and yellow and rich because yolks are yellow and egg whites are white. Anyways, after these doughs have been chilled in the fridge, 2 hours, they get scooped out, put on a tray, and into the oven they go. 350°, 18 minutes or so. Now, this very, very, very big difference. The egg whites are a lot more brown, a lot more golden brown, a lot flatter, a lot wider. And picking them up, they're a lot spongier and softer, which makes sense because egg whites not only have higher protein content than egg yolks, they have a lot more water content. So, when you add extra protein and extra water to a cookie recipe, it's going to puff up a little bit more. It's going to spread a little bit more and it's going to be a little bit more on the spongy side rather than the chewy or the denser side. Now, the egg yolks one is really interesting. There's actually not a lot of browning here compared to the egg whites. I think just because egg whites are so much more pure protein that browns quicker in the oven compared to the fats in an egg yolk. The egg yolk one is a lot tighter. It's almost not brown at all and it has that more like softer, it falls apart faster, more denser texture. So Rachel and Nico taste tested this one because I was kind of getting sugared out at this point, but I had to, you know, rest up so I can go back in because I'm on cookie cool down right now. So the egg white one is definitely a little chewier and just spongier and almost crunchier on the outsides. There's also more of a contrast between the outside and the inside because they spread a lot more. The edges got a little crispier and the inside is a little bit soft. It kind of almost falls apart in not necessarily a great way. Nico said on the egg yolk only cookie there was a softer tear, but both of them immediately agreed that they loved the taste of the egg yolk only one, which also was not a surprise. It's a lot more fat in egg yolks and it's richer. It's just better overall. It's kind of like using butter versus oil in certain situations. Rachel has now been converted to probably only using egg yolks in her cookies from now on. I think compared to the control, it depends on what you want. I think if you want a really dense, rich cookie, I think it's worth using the extra effort to put in those egg yolks. I would probably not recommend using only egg whites, though. I feel like that kind of defeats the purpose of a cookie. It makes it this confusing muffin cookie hybrid that I wouldn't necessarily want to do. I think just make one or the other. If you got extra egg yolks, use those. That's another way to, you know, make cookies. Okay, for the next one, Rachel actually came up with this test. This one is going to be testing the method of how you mix your dough. So, the standard control one, we use a stand mixer, but how about using your hands to mix just the dough? Cuz not everybody has a stand mixer. And then what would it be like if you use your food processor? Kind of a weird outfield play that you wouldn't really think about to make cookie dough. Let's give it a shot. Mixing it by hand. I've done this many times. You definitely can't get the same amount of aireriness and whip as the food processor one. So, I'm expecting this to be a little bit denser. So, here's the hand mix dough. And with our food processor one, again, we're just adding everything in. And the blade is mixing this dough together. And shockingly, not only does it work, there's a really cool effect that the blades create because they're slicing through everything in this thing, the chocolate chips also kind of get shredded up. The dough almost becomes like a chocolate speckled cookie dough, something you don't get in a stand mixer or with other machines purely because there's a blade in here combining everything. It's shearing and eroding away the edges of the chocolate chips and imparting it into the dough itself. So, the color is way darker compared to any other method so far. I am really curious to see one, how this bakes out, and two, how it tastes. Maybe we stumbled upon something really cool. All right, you can probably tell which one the food processor cookie is. But let's start with the handmixed one first. So, the handmix one is definitely denser. There's less air in it because we don't have the sand mixture to whip that into it. It ripples a little bit more and looks like a more of that like dense, solid, chewier cookie that you want. The food processor one is really interesting. So, not only is it darker, it's rippier, has these pockets of chocolate that are more spread out, it almost looks like a chocolate espresso cookie based on the color alone. When you eat the handmix cookie, I'm tasting a lot more granulated sugar crystals, which is not necessarily a bad thing. I think if you like that extra crunch and burst, I think that's a great thing. And so, when it comes to",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food processor cookie though, this one tastes almost not like a chocolate chip cookie at all. It tastes It tastes like a chocolate cookie. Almost like a brownie cookie. It's also It also tastes sweeter because I think when you shave off shards of the chocolate chips into the dough, they're sweeter than usual. And there's more sugar per dough area, if that makes any sense. Rachel likes it a lot. She said it's really soft and said it was just like a brownie cookie but without having to make brownies. And I feel like it's a really good way to kind of make something out of an un ideal scenario. You have a food processor. You don't have any stand mixers. So, you want to make cookies, you do that. You not only get a brownie, you get a cookie as well. And it's a fun way to, I guess, change up the flavor and texture of it. You don't get these big pockets of chocolate chips as before. You just get more of a spread out chocolate chip flavor throughout the cookie. And visually, they look great. I think that was a really fun one. All right. Next, we're going to be testing different fats. This one was something we've been wanting to do for quite some time after testing the other ones. We are going to be testing coconut oil versus lard versus dry-aged beef tallow because we had that in the fridge compared to the traditional method of just using butter just to see how it affects texture, flavor, aroma, and just ultimately the experience of a cookie. So, when we make each of these, we're going to be making the dough separately and we're going to be using and substituting the butter with each of the fats mentioned previously. Here are the label. This is how they look and let's see how they turn out. So, the coconut oil is on the left. It's very spread out, super spread out and very flat, which makes sense because I think coconut oil has a softer melting point compared to butter. So, it makes more sense that it's spread out faster than the butter. Lard one does not smell like lard at all. It just smells fragrant and aromatic in a different way. And I think if you didn't tell anybody, they'd be like," """"Wow"," this cookie smells great."""" The texture is definitely a little bit tighter compared to the coconut oil", which makes a lot more sense. Now, the beef tallow one looks blonde, very blonde. There's almost no browning on it, which already is not off to the perfect start, but maybe that's just the way that it's just been dry-aged and doesn't have those melty properties to where it almost didn't want to go. All right, let's move on to texture and taste. So, the coconut oil one definitely looks like a tastes cookie, but also kind of oily. Not a huge fan of that one. The lard was actually quite surprising. The lard tastes like a very aromatic cookie. Like someone dialed up the aroma to 15, but unless you told anybody, I don't think they would suspect you used pig fat. So, that one is actually really interesting. I can see why lard is used in many desserts and not just seen as a savory cooking ingredient. Okay, dry-aged beef tallow definitely smells like a steakhouse. And we were the most curious about this one. Um, everyone smelled it and got really weirded out and excited at the same time. The decibel levels were rising after each nose uh got close to the cookie. Rachel did not like the aroma very much, it seems. Uh oh, she's gagging. That's great. All right, let's have Nico get in there. Rachel's on cool down right now. Nico went and tried it. No, no, no. That's really not good. It's like I'm eating a butcher shop. Hm. Interesting. This is great. I'm just laughing in the back. Needless to say, we will not be using beef tallow in our cookies in the future. All right, next up is a pretty simple test. Baking dough temperatures. So, sometimes you leave the dough in the fridge, sometimes you have it in the freezer for whatever purposes, and sometimes you just have it on the counter. Is there a big difference in where you start the dough from when it's put in the oven? Let's go ahead and see. We're going to be baking a frozen one that's been pulled from the freezer, been solidly frozen. We're baking one also that's been left out and come to room temperature and comparing that with the control which is bake from the fridge. And obviously these baking times had to be adjusted. The frozen one got three more minutes. The room temperature one got three less minutes just to make sure that they achieved ideally similar results in dnesses. And here they are. When you have a room temperature cookie, the fat is already more melted than the other two. So it's going to spread a little bit more. It's going to a little bit more crispy. It's going to start to go through that mayard browning process a lot sooner than the other one. The frozen ones is going to be more crispy only on the edges compared to the whole thing. While the inside is going to be more, I guess, blonde. So, you can clearly tell that the one from Frozen has the largest ring of just blonde cookie dough. And the one that is room temperature has more browning overall compared to the control. And the control, because it was in the fridge, is in between both as expected. But it is really cool to see the side by side. So, I guess it depends on what kind of cookie you want to achieve. Again, if you like Tates, go for the middle one. If you like more contrast, go for the left one. Personally, I think contrast in a cookie is one of the most important things and most interesting things about a cookie from everything I've learned from people and pastry chefs. So, I personally love to bake from frozen. It also gives you a lot of control and make sure that you don't have that spreading problem that a lot of chocolate chip cookies recipes do have depending on your oven as well. The flavor of the cookies is pretty much going to be identical, but the texture, I think, does play a very vital role in your chocolate chip cookie experience. So, decide what you want for yourself. All right, the next test is going to be baking your cookies on the top rack and baking them on the bottom rack. As typically recommended, things are baked on the middle rack in ovens to keep things the most even, which is exactly the same rack we baked our control cookies on. What if you moved it all the way up? And what if you moved it all the way down? Will it actually affect the way it bakes? Let's find out. Here are the results. So, as you can see, the ones baked on the bottom rack, which is technically closest to the heat source, is way more golden brown just because it's getting a lot more heat. So, these are going to cook faster. These took like 3 minutes less and they got a lot more brown and just were ready to go a lot sooner. And the top cookies, you can tell by the visuals that it actually has more of an even spread in color throughout. It's the slowest to bake out of all three. It took extra 3 minutes and it's the most even and has more time to spread out because it has less of the heat source blasting away pan it's sitting on. Even though it's the closest to the top of the oven, which is made out of metal, I think just the distance away from the heat source does just make it bake at a slower pace. It's almost like a low and slow situation. Crispy golden brown all over from the bottom rack. If you really rush for time and you like this kind of cookie, that's the rack for you. If you want more of like a low and slow bake that takes over 20 minutes, but you get a lot softer and gooier of a texture, I would say go for the top rack. And if you like somewhere in the middle, go for the control. But it was cool to see that just by adjusting your baking position of your pan instead of half-hazardly throwing it on any rack, it will directly affect the way that your cookie turns out and how long it takes to finish baking. Cuz even though a lot of recipes have specific bake times, I think the most important thing is to know when it's done, either it's by eye or by smell. All right, the next one is a little bit more interesting. So the phrase pan banging cookies has been on the internet for quite some time. I believe a few people have made this really popular. It's a technique where you take a certain recipe of chocolate chip cookies and you slam the pan down on the counter to let the dough balls just get banged down between cooking in the middle and sometimes afterwards as well, creating a potentially beautiful rippley structure that makes it look really, really, really appetizing and amazing. If you looked up pan bang cookies, there's a few famous people that have really made it popular. And I've definitely tried this a few times. But I wanted to test how would it turn out if you banged it during the middle of cooking as you're supposed to versus banging it both in the middle of cooking and at the end of cooking and if it's even worth taking your cookies out of the oven to make this extra step and wake up your neighbors and possibly damage whatever surface you're slamming your trays down onto. So, for this method, we'll be taking one out halfway through baking, dropping it onto the counter from probably like a 1 ft height and letting it just like slam down and flop around a little bit. It should be high enough to where clearly the dough is being agitated and spread out a little bit more, but not so high that everything flies off the table and not so low that you're just kind of hitting it a little bit. It just need to be pretty severe. I will acknowledge that the original pan banging recipe is actually designed for this technique and is baked from frozen, but I wanted to see if this technique could be applied to just your normal chocolate chip cookie recipe and if it does make a difference. So, after banging this one, it's going back in the oven. After banging the second one, we're actually going to bang it again after it comes out of the oven at the very end to see how they compare. And let's have a look. As comes to no surprise, if you move around your cookie and bang it a lot more, it's going to become flatter cuz you're just slamming it down while it's still hot and letting it spread out a lot more. And you're probably interrupting a lot of the browning at the very end, too. So, it kind of becomes less brown visually. What's cool about this one, though, is that normally chocolate chip cookies don't really melt into pools when you're making chocolate sugar cookies using chips, but because of this method, you're actually agitating enough to where the melted chocolate inside the chip is actually being spread out and moved around. So, it actually doesn't look like I used chocolate chips for the cookies that were banged twice. But the whole entire thing kind of becomes flat. It doesn't become thin. It just becomes flat, which I would say is pretty appealing when it comes to a cookie because usually good ones made with good chocolate end up that way. And I think that is one way to kind of make your chocolate chip cookie not look like it was made with traditional chocolate chips. So from a texture point of view, you almost get these flatter pools of chocolate that when they're cooled firm back up and you get these nice shard levels of chocolate that usually you can only achieve using good chocolate that melts really well in the oven. The flavor is still the same, but because the texture is less ripply, less studded chocolate chips, it looks like a flatter, more gourmet cookie, and it eats like one as well texture- wise. And I really like those like shards and levels of chocolate that end up in a really good chocolate chip cookie. All right, up next we're going to be testing the rest times for dough. Now, personally, I'm a huge advocate of resting your dough as long as possible in the fridge, in the freezer. Some people say a couple days. I've gone for weeks and months, and it has actually made a huge difference. But let's just keep this to testing a dough that's made and rested for an hour, so basically fresh. A dough that's rested for a day and a dough that's rested for a whole week and seeing how it comes out, flavor, texture, and visually. So Rachel was nice enough to make a control batch of the dough and have it ready a week in advance so that we can just bake them all at the same time. Let's bake these and see how they turn out. The fresh batch seems to be a lot more brown and that makes a little bit more sense because the flour has not had enough time to absorb all of the butter. So the butter and the browning kind of happens a lot quicker on the one week one because the flour is hydrated and a lot of the browning agents that are typically exposed to the elements are now absorbed. It has less of that browning happen. It's more of this consistent just rested up dough, which has been what I've noticed across making a lot of chocolate cookies. And the one that's been rested one day is in the middle. So Rachel is going to taste test this one. She said that the one that was made fresh and rested for 1 hour is definitely a lot crispier. You could probably get a lot more of those sugar crystals. You could taste it because the sugar has not had enough time to dissolve slowly into the liquids and into the flour. Upon a comparison, I think we all agreed and including Rachel, that the one week rested dough is by far the most superior because the sugar crystals have been able to dissolve from the liquids and kind of mix with the rest of the dough. It activates less of a surface area on your tongue per square millimeter, if that makes sense. It's almost like eating fruit versus drinking a smoothie. The fruits salad is going to be a lot more explosive and you taste each fruit more individually. The fruit smoothie though tastes really good, but everything's kind of blended down, so it's going to taste less sweet. One week one tastes more complex because everybody has time to, you know, exchange flavor molecules and all the fat and water soluble flavor compounds. Finally have some chances to dissolve and kind of permeate as much of the cookie as possible. So every time you're taking a bite of it, you're getting way more flavor compounds of every ingredient you put in there per square millimeter on your tongue. The flour is hydrated, which means it's a little bit chewier and everything has a more of a complex flavor. Is there a limit? Personally, I didn't have time for this video, but I have kept cookie dough in the fridge for a couple weeks and frozen it for a couple months and have baked it, and it did taste way different than just one week. Obviously, there's going to be diminishing returns. But, I don't think it hurts to keep your cookie dough in the fridge for as long as you want, cuz I don't think that's going bad anytime soon if you store it correctly. And if you freeze it, I think it just gets better. So, we've tested a lot of cookies and a lot of different ways to make cookies today. I hope that it's been educating and informing as it was for us. And it's just really cool to see these tests carried out next to each other. I decided to take all these random like leftover half scoops of cookie dough and combine it into the pizookie. So, this is technically every single test we've done uh together in one cookie form. So, after it's mashed up, I'm going to put it into a cast iron pan with some parchment paper and a sprinkle of Maldon on top after it's been baked. And yeah, it's uh this is the pizookie. And to be honest, it's kind of cakey. I think it's because there was a lot of that honey and maple syrup dough that had a lot of extra water that contributed to that. So, it didn't really taste like the typical bizookie and uh more like a chocolate chip banana bread. Just no banana. But hey, we're not letting this go to waste. It's good food. And we're just going to pack that up. Also, all the cookies that we broke apart and showed for camera. Obviously, we didn't finish every single one. But these cookie shards that are perfectly fine were packed up into a couple of containers. And all of the dough and all the perfect cookies that weren't broken into were packed into another container. And the best part is that with all the perfect dough balls that we scooped out with all the dough, nothing was left behind. I took home probably 90% of this. And I'm always glad because chocolate chip cookies and the reason why I love making them and I love diving deep and exploring and making them again is one, every time I make them, they come out different even if the same recipe, which means that the little tiniest adjustments will make a significant difference. Maybe I mixed one for 15 minutes. Maybe I baked it on a rack lower than the previous time. And I think if anything, today shows that going through all these experiments, most of these do have a significant impact on the way that your cookies will turn out. And maybe that's the fun part is that they're never going to be the same every single time and they're always going to be a little bit different, but there's always hopefully just one more thing to minmax and to improve and to make better and to learn. And maybe think that's why I make chocolate chip cookies so much. even though when I don't eat them a lot myself. They're also something that I think are universally loved that people love eating and make for great gifts at any time, any day of the week. No one's really going to be mad that you brought them a cookie and they're going to be excited because, well, who doesn't love chocolate chip cookies? So, not only do I have a lot of cookies that I'm ready to give out to friends, I also have a lot of dough that will be interesting to see how long I can rest in my fridge for and how they'll turn out after a couple weeks, months, or even years. This was a very fun day for all of us. I've wanted to do this experiment for some time now and I learned a lot more about cookies even though I've been making them for so long that I thought I knew almost everything. I guess that's the fun part about food. When you really deep dive, you learn more and you learn that you really know less than you even thought. Oh, before I go, I will say if I had to combine a couple of these adjustments to what makes a better version of a chocolate chip cookie. Number one, brown butter. Number two, chop your chocolate fresh. Number three, egg yolks only if you have the time and the money for it. Number four, rest it for at least a week, if not more. Number five, bake it at 400. Obviously, there's so many things you can do with mixins, and my personal recipe has a lot of different things, but I think when it comes to traditional cookies," those ones are the ones that I'm definitely going to keep. Just not beef tallow. We we are not going to discuss that one anymore.

1kYSiVkJkjQ,"We are tackling some burgers from Bob's Burgers. Starting with 3 lb of short rib and 3 lb of chuck roast. In lie of a meat grinder, the best way to grind beef is to cut it into small cubes and place in the freezer for about 15 minutes. Then in batches, we're going to add the beef to the food processor and pulse until we get a nice heavily grind. Like Bob said, black garlic is from Korea and it's extremely expensive. So we're going to treat it with great care as we use it to make black garlic mayo. Add four or five cloves of black garlic to an immersion blender cup before adding about a/2 cup of mayo and blending until smooth and extremely stinky. This burger is on a bed of baby spinach. So, we're going to put that on top of our toasted bun before searing our burger and adding a big old slab of fresh mozzarella cheese that we're going to cover so it melts completely like so. Onto our bed of baby spinach it goes along with a healthy smear of our black garlic mayo. Top with our toasted bun and slice in half to reveal that allimportant cross-section.

FVLGm6GStEE,"[Music] Is that the real Millennium Falcon? Yeah, it's the real Millennium Falcon. Idiot. Did I get a a blue milk? A green milk? I guess one of everything. Again, not what I expected, but I don't even care. There's nothing I don't like about this. The rest of it tastes like if I licked the floor of my college bar. Hey there, folks. We're at Disney World and we're here to do one thing and one thing only. Eat everything at Galaxy's Edge, the only part of Disney World that I think I'm going to like. Follow me into this magical place. I might not be a Disney adult, but I am a Star Wars adult big time. I love Star Wars. I'm currently doing a chronological rewatch of the entire series of films. I know there's a lot of love for the prequels, but uh if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all. That's the Disney motto. Is that why you've been hating on Disney the entire time? I don't like Disney. I don't like children. Families in general. You know what I don't want to do is wait an hour and a half in line. Makes me want to die. So they take your fingerprint. Disney's got my my biometrics now. What are the bubbles? Stupid bubbles. Trolley going to hit me or something. We're not even riding a ride. We're not going to find the magic of Disney. Oh. Oh shoot. Just beyond that tunnel. Andrew is the Galaxy's Edge. The Galaxy's Edge. Wow. Dude, they found it, huh? I like the lighting. That looks familiar. I I know this. This is very Tatooine right now. So, I'm I'm stoked. All right. Okay. I'm a Disney adult. It just happened. They got the A-wing. They got the X-wing over here. That's uh Po Dammer and stuff. Oh, I want I want a helmet. I want a X-wing pilot helmet. They're all looking at something though. What are they looking at? Oh, there's Mando, dude. There's Mando right there, dude. What do I say? What do I do? No. Andrew, come on. No. No. Come on, man. Look at all the kids. No. No. All the kids want to get in there. Okay. Fully fully converted. I'm not even on a ride yet and I love it here. So, we're at Katsaka's Kettles, our first stop. They have kettle corn and coffee drinks here. I just saw somebody with that star bucket and it glows. So, I'm going to wear that thing all day. I'm going to look like a fool. How else am I supposed to have popcorn and a cold brew at the same time and express my fandom? This day just got awesome. It was already honestly going very good. This uh sweet cream cold brew is lovely. I love the uh cocoa puffs on top or the space eggs. Uh they they mix with the sweet cream and you end up with this like hyper concentrated breakfast cereal. It's really good. You have to eat them like a bottom feather. You got to shuck them out. It's pretty light and sweet. It reminds me of like, you know, sweet cream cold brew. It's pretty much what it is, but it's got cocoa puffs on it. Cocoa puffs are nothing but a good addition. Kind of hard to eat because you get chunks of ice in there. Overall, I love it. I'm going to give it an eight. It's a solid eight. It's described as a trio of savory flavors. These taste like Fruity Pebbles to me. These don't taste savory at all. Yeah, it's fruit spelled with two O's. Maybe that's what savory things taste like on Alien Planets. It's tasty enough. I'm not a huge fan of Froot Loops and Fruity Pebbles. The popcorn on its own a six. I like it, but it's not something I would seek out. In the Death Star tub, a 10. Hard 10. Close. All right, now we're getting to Ronto's Roers. Uh, looks like uh some wraps, pork rinds, and they have booze that I'm going to get. All right, dude. We're toled up. One of everything. Later, my sweets. Okay, first up, we have this cup of fruit and vegetables covered in some kind pleasantly smoky, not spicy. It's like a hot sauce that's smoky but not spicy. I like that. And it's very nice on pineapple. Watermelon. The fruit is perfectly ripe. Really nice and juicy. The smoky little like I want to say like tajine or something kind of sauce is a really nice accompaniment. Smoky without being spicy. Works equally equally well on the cucumber. and what looks like um giant radish. No, that's hikima. That's hikima. This is delightful. I love every part of this. There's nothing I don't like about this. I wish there I wish it was just fruit and not vegetables, but I appreciate the vegetables there. For that reason alone, it's getting a nine. This is just fruit. Good night. Next up, we got some cosmic pork rinds or whatever the hell they called them. Oh, they're they're spiced with um curry. They're curry spice. Oh, no, they're not. That's weird. They smell like curry, but they taste like nacho cheesier Doritos meets curry. There's curry in there, but there's also Doritos. Pork rinds are nice and light and crisp. Sometimes you get these and they're a little straight from the farm. You'd never know this was an animal. And that's how you should eat meat with as much cognitive dissonance as possible. There's a little bit of heat. Just a tiny bit. Like I'm talking Wendy's spicy chicken. They could use more salt, more sugar, too. I'm gonna give them an eight. They're really good, though. All right, so now this is the uh Ronto wrap. Just dub that in cuz I don't know what it's called. Sorry. So, we got some pork loin. Some kind of sausage. It's like the pork loin is just in there just for extra protein. Just like we need these people to be wellfed so they spend more money because I don't taste it at all. It's like not there. There's uh some kind of mayo based sauce in there with light herbs, but mostly I'm just tasting the sausage, which only tastes like a hot dog. It's very clearly like more artisal kind of like rough grind sausage. That's not a hot dog. It's got big chunks of stuff in it. I think that if I had to have picked any flavor for it to be leaning toward, maybe something like that, like there's a little bit of onu happening there. It's not altogether unpleasant. It's not altogether unpleasant. Who came up with that phrase? I like it. I'm not crazy about it, but I like it. So, I'll give it a seven. Solid seven. All right. Next up, we have the vegetarian alternative that looks to have uh some grilled zucchini in there, carrot, and a chickpea kind of sloth. I'm guessing it's going to be Moroccan spices. And some more greenery. This really looks like cilantro. Yeah, it's cilantro. Do you like it? I'm back to being anti- Disney again. It It seriously like involuntarily induces a gag reflex for me. I can't help it. So, I can't I think you should rank this one. Well, you know that I enjoy a vegetarian thing, so this is kind of perfect. I'm just going to hold this in next to my mouth so you can hear the bite as graphically as possible. Okay, I have had my fair share of vegetarian wraps. I like the sauce. I like the texture of the zucchini, but it's still got bite to it, but it's soft on the outside, you know, but they didn't overcook it. I really taste the carrot, too. Like the carrot brings a sweetness. Um, I like the spice. I would give this 7 out of 10. Andrew gives it a zero. I give it a seven. And so, if you add those together, it's a seven. [Music] Next up is the beer. It's a mild sour like has a very very mild I don't want to say fruit flavor but but but it's it's a mild sour which is lovely on a day like today. This is nice. This is refreshing. I rate this beer a seven. I it's it's it's refreshing and crisp and lightly sour. So now we're at the Dock Bay 7 food and cargo. Yeah. No, dude. It's just like we're in a real docking bay. There's the cargo container suspended over that nice family's heads. Okay, first up, the pika tuna poke. Raw tuna tossed in a spicy Sriracha dressing served with green papaya salad, pickled mushrooms, fresh herbs, crispy garlic. That sounds dank. It has a little cilantro in it. I'm just going to pretend I didn't see that little bit. That's really fishy. Oh, that's gross. It tastes like seaweed. I'm not a big tuna guy, but I like tuna pokey. I like tuna tartara, but it's got to be really like clean tuna flavor because otherwise you get this really intense kind of low tide flavor. That's what I'm getting. I'm going to give that a a three. Like the flavors around it are great. Like those garlic, the fried garlic chips are great. The tuna is just way too fishy. Yeah. Get that away from me. All right. Next up, we have the smoked kadu pork ribs. Says it's a tangy barbecue sauce with a blueberry corn muffin. That's interesting and a red cabbage slot. And see how they rip. They rip good. They rip real good. So, these feel properly cooked. Like the meat's not falling off the bone. It's loosely attached. You can you can separate it easily, but it's still hanging onto the bone. That's ideal dness for ribs. Little dry. I mean, what do you expect, Andrew? We're in a cargo bay. Sauce isn't nearly as intense as it smells, so that's nice. But not bad. The sauce tastes tangy, very tomato heavy, almost fruity. Your fingers are awfully dirty. What are you working in a cargo bay? Let's try this blueberry corn muffin. Little sad, little underseasoned. Distinct blueberry flavor. Just the right amount to have with barbecue. I'm going to try some with this barbecue sauce on it. Do you think that sauce is seasoned with cargo bay leaf? That one was actually good. That one was actually good. I'm going to start making blueberry corn muffins with my barbecue. That is a nice pairing. That really plays nicely. SL is really whatever. That's their gesturally. Barely has any dressing on it. Mostly tastes like onion. Mostly tastes like red onion. Yeah. Overall, uh not great. Some fun ideas. Blueberry corn muffins. Great. Sauce is okay. Ribs are dry. SLO is whatever. I'd eat the whole thing. I'd eat the whole thing, but only if I was hungry and it was all I had. So, I think that's a five. Next up, we have hot chicken that has been brushed with a Chipotle hot sauce. And the Chipotle. I just smelled Chipotle right now. It's so strong. Such a strong smell. It's definitely a chicken thigh. Cilantro. It's actually the right amount of Chipotle. It's distinct, but not overpowering, but it has a little heat to it. I wouldn't feed that to a kid. The chicken is decently crispy considering it's sauce. Definitely, you know, using some cornstarch or something in that batter or breading to get it crisp and keep it crisp. I think the rice is going to be here just as a gesture. Looks Yeah, it's just unseasoned jasmine rice. We got a corn salad over here with chunks of stuff in it. I think that might be hecka. Let's see what it bullseye hikima drop. It's a decent corn salad. I I almost think that the hikima is unnecessary. That crunch kind of feels out of place with the nice soft corn. They definitely charred the corn nice and good. Way better than I thought it was going to be. I'm not crazy about the corn salad. This the rice is unseasoned. The chicken's good. I'm going to give it a seven. It's decent. Next up, we have the Batuan beef and crispy Topato, which is what they call potatoes in the Star Wars universe. God, there's cilantro in everything. These potatoes look crazy crisp. They look like they're battered. [Music] Wo, they like they taste like plantains. Delicious. Fantastic. You can't get a crust like this on a on a potato. They have a mild sweetness about them. All right, we got the Brussels sprout. What's happening there is they're roasting a ton of vegetables on mass and they're too close together. They're all crowded together, so no browning is happening. It's almost like they're being steamed. We got a little bit of browning on this cauliflower here, but as you can see, there's herbs on it and they are most assuredly dry herbs. Go to your pantry and smell your spice rack. That's what this the ve vegetables taste like. The beef doesn't appear to have a sauce on it. It's been seasoned, but there's no sauce. Decently moist. Definitely been being held for a while, so it's dried out a little bit, but it's a lot of fat in it, so it's decently moist. Flavor's okay. It's barely there. You know what it reminds me of? Exactly. It tastes like United inflight meal service, which is weird cuz we're in a cargo van. I don't like inflight meals when I'm down on the ground trying to pretend I'm in space. We're not in space. I'm in a cargo cargo bay. You say it. I'm in a cargo bay. I'm in a cargo bay. It's a better than average United inflight meal. And United inflight meals are garbage. The potato tomatoes. These are good. This isn't a plantain. This is yuka. Deep fried yuk. Yuka. That's what this is. I I knew it was not potato and I couldn't place it. It's yuka. And that's going to bump you up to a five. Just these cuz these are fantastic. It's time for dessert. We have here is something called a methyl orb. It's just it's just a jelly mold cake pretty much. I thought it was a silicon implant. Yeah. It's got these like sparkles on it and then you see the plate underneath and it just makes it look a little otherworldly. It's nice. Blue raspberry with some goo. It's got goo next to it. Brown goo. It's passion fruit. I love passion fruit so much. Goes really nice with the blueberry. Let's see about this crumble. It tastes like a packet of brown sugar oatmeal, but it's just the sugar and maybe like graham cracker crumbs or something. Little freeze-dried strawberries. I kind of think they just took like strawberry, brown sugar oatmeal, and just like brown it up. That's what it tastes like. But it's nice. It works well with this. It adds a nice hit of uh sweetness cuz this is sweet, but it's very acidic between the blue ras and the passion fruit. That's delicious. It's weird. tea powder with goo and jell-o. That's the only reason it's getting a eight because it tastes delicious, but it's just conceptually odd. Hey, that's space for you. That's Star Wars, you know? Delicious, but conceptually odd. Curly Starlac is a kettle one botanical grapefruit and rose vodka, minuteade, limeade, raspberry, spicy mango flavors. Whoa. Bears no resemblance to a Sarlac pit. Like a cargo bay. First and foremost, I taste rose, rose water, uh, or, you know, a rose flavored vodka. I guess in this case, it mostly tastes like rose. I'm definitely getting some other fruit in there. I'm I'm I'm pretty stunned that like a rose water drink in America is so popular because like Americans tend not to take to rose water. It's like not culturally enjoyed very much here. So to see it front and center like this, it's very culinarily exciting for me and it makes me, it wakes me up inside. Really balanced flavor. I'm not a huge rose water guy. Like I enjoy rose water when it's part of something else and that's what this is doing. But it is still the first and foremost flavor. Really impressive. Really enjoy it. Also, it tastes like juice. This does not taste like it has alcohol. This tastes like juice. Rose juice. cargo bag. Give it a nine. It's delicious. All right. The Taco Dana Quencher is Bikardi Dragon Berry Rum. BS blue purisowl liquor. Simply orange with pineapple and kiwi. Sounds delicious. That sucks. That sucks. I feel like they used they used like Everclear in that. It it it has this really harsh alcohol flavor. Not even a harsh alcohol like hit. It doesn't hurt. It just tastes like Everclair. Just a grain alcohol. And the rest of it tastes like if I licked the floor of my college bar where they didn't cargo, I was making a good joke. Bread. Can you not just like like one of the one of the tenants of mindfulness is listening with your whole body and not just waiting for your turn to say cargo plate. It actually tastes like this drink that I used to have at another bar that didn't carve. It was called It was called the cargo blend. It tastes like if you put in a blender Everclear PEZ and green. I'm going to give it a zero. I hate it. Truly hate it. The opposite of of of the Sarlac sirly Sarlac. This stuff. No kids in ear shot. the specs. [Music] Now, we're at the milk bar where there are four options available. We have blue milk, which I'm stoked to try. We have green milk, which Luke famously drank directly from the ape anteaters tick. Uh, and then we have the tenuous swirl crunchy cereal. And then we have kessle run rations. Do this rations. That's people have wanted me to make that for so long. What planet are you from, sir? Um, Brooklyn. And how about yourself? I'm right here on Batu. Never left this rock. I mean, it's a good rock. Danger. Yes, I am taking you home all the way back to New York City. I hope you have sweet dreams, too. I Oh, Got storm dreams coming, but it's okay. I miss you. Hey, what's up, I was just eating some popcorn and uh I I couldn't get it open. It was all objects are conscious. You know that, right? All right. Are you hot or something? I'm hot. So, you know what? You know what I love when it's really hot out? Some milk. Brad and I are delirious because it's so hot. We've been walking around and this shirt, while breathable, I'm making a mess out of it because it's very hot. What better than than some blue milk? No. Oh, that's disappointing. That's disappointing. I always imagined blue milk is like vanilla milk. Tastes like Smarties. It tastes like a cheap fruit candy, but not fruit. Just cuz I'm so disappointed. It's blue milk. This is the thing. You have to stick the landing. People have to be like, ""Oh my god, that's obscene how good that is."" I don't like this at all. It's kind of a let down. If you've been waiting to try blue milk your whole life, ever since you saw Uncle Owen chewing on it at breakfast, didn't he sound like he had his mouth full the whole time? And didn't it kind of sound delicious? So, I'm going to give it a three. I don't like this at all. Next up, green milk. That that titty milk. I guess the blue milk is tip milk, too. But this one, you you see it. What's that taste like? It's rose. It's got rose in it. I think I am so thrilled with the role that rose is playing in this theme park is a sentence I didn't think I was going to say today. I'm going to be really embarrassed if that's not rose badish fam, but you know me, I sometimes know what rose tastes like. Well, we have the cocktail situation here where one is awesome and rose and the other one is lame and bad. Again, not what I expected, but I don't even care. Like, I don't know what I was expecting, but who cares about what I was expecting. Here's what it tastes like. Good [Music] on a nice hot day like this. This is actual milk, cuz this is going to give me a problem. Nothing like a cold cup of milk on a hot day. It's Florida, New Year's. I like this. I have a brain freeze, which is I almost like it. I'm going to give it an eight because I think it's just rose. That cocktail had other stuff going on. Whatever fruit was in there was playing really nice with it. This is just rose, which is nice. And again, I'm thrilled that you're making me like rose. I think it's the milk. I think it like mellows out the rose a of it all. I'm going to give it an eight. Next up, we have the I don't know what you call this. Call this or something. This is the the blue milk Baja Blast. Ah, it's just melted milk on top. I can't get to the raspberry sauce. Oh, that's what it is. Yeah, I knew the whole time. I'd call this a market improvement. Like the raspberry brings a different dimension to that um Smarties flavor and the nerds are just like a nice explosion of sour in the middle of it, which milk, you think nerds and milk, you'd think that I I was uh I was I was drinking nerds and milk. I bow my mind. Uh but no, it really works. but it's never something I would ever order personally. I'm going to give it a five. Next up, we have rations, which appear to be a little bit of pastry dough. I can't tell if there's something in the middle. I kind of want to Okay, those are just little little quissant. There's a hair on it, but it's my hair. Also, stop being grossed out by hair. Call me when you find a fingernail. Anyway, this is Oh. Oh, it's chocolate. Oh, I thought it was like barbecue sauce. I was like, ""What the is this?"" But it's chocolate, dude. Oh, man. Okay, it's not bad. That chocolate sauce is like halfway between Hershey's syrup and hot fudge sauce. I want it to just be hot fudge sauce. There's another hair. What's going on here? The hair is made into it. No, space hair. I really want this to just be hot fudge sauce. Not hot, but just fudge sauce. I just want that flavor. I don't want the Hershey elements. would be a nine if it was hot fudge flavor, but with that syrup in there, I think it just kind of ruins it, but not enough for me to give it less than a seven. I'd still munch down on this all day, all night, with or without a plate, with or without you watching. Andrew, what is that? This is a thermal detonator. No, no, no. No, dude. It's just Coca-Cola. Chill out. Brad and I are losing our minds, so I'm hoping a little caffeine. That's Coca-Cola, which I would give a seven out of 10 if it weren't in a thermal detonator, which it gets a nine out of 10 for being in. [Music] All right. Okay. We got the whole spread here. Let's start with the batu bits. They look like uh freeze-dried vegetables, and they are cilantro. God damn it. It's everywhere. But even though it has cilantro skip and I love freeze-dried vegetables just as a snack, I'm not going to hold cilantro against that dip. I can tell it's tasty outside of the cilantness. They might have fried these. They're really oily. And they might be fried. So maybe maybe I'll give it an eight. It's very good. It's good and spicy, too. Next up, we have the thruster roasted banana flatbread. Non flatbread top with spiced chorizo beef and Portuguese blend. Uh so supposedly they roast this in a cruster which is very very rebellious. That's nice. That's really good. It tastes like a really high quality frozen naan pizza or something. like a really high quality, one of those newer brands of frozen snacks. So, it's not, you know, amazing, but the flavors are really solid. Barely a little tickle of heat from the chorizo. I can clearly taste the chorizo and the cheeses. Like, they both stand out. And there might be like like turmeric and like Indian spices in there. It's quite unlike any flatbread I've ever had before. At least in this case. Next up, I got to get into this. So, this looks like that portion bread. Finally, we're going to eat some portions. And it's just uh a little bread guy with a bunch of cheese stuffed in there. So, that's good. Amazing. The roll has the characteristics of a pretzel and a little sourdough bureau. It's like halfway between. There's a good chew to it, the way that you expect from pretzel, but there's also a really uh blistery craggly crust that has a great crunch to it, but not too much. And then the cheese, I think it's like pimento cheese. Like it's a little spicy. It's a little smoky, but it mostly reminds me of pimento juice. Divine. No notes. 10. Love it. Perfect snack. All right, so next up we have the meat and cheese board. Look like we have some bagel crisps. like poppy seed bagel crisps. That's what those look like. And we have what looks like some really hardcore uh Spanish. Oh. Oh god. Okay. We have a natural casing on there. Extremely smoky. Like heated scotch smoky. Oh, a little spicy. I think it's probably the same stuff they're putting on the pizza. Solid. Then uh some kind of jelly over here. I don't know what the hell that is. Oh man, really bright fruit jelly. I'm thinking Mikey Cash and CR, which I've never had on on a meat and cheese board, and I think it's going to work nice. Then we have the flatbread. What the hell? It's salty and sugary. It has sugar on it. And I taste some kind of herb. I think it's like mint or something. It's probably going to go really nice with the chorizo, honestly. Little bit of space pastrami. Move over cap says there's a new pastrami in the galaxy in this quadrant. Uh, then we have a soft cheese here. It's bara that has been dyed blue. I don't know what the hell that is. It's covered in what looks like herbs, but when you touch them, they smear like like like ash, like charcoal. You see that? Yeah. And it doesn't taste like anything. This is probably goat cheese. It looks like it's been rolled in something something crispy. That looks like cheese. Yeah, sure. It's almost like they're tempura bits. Uh tenasu or something, but they're not. I don't know what they are. They're little crispy things. They have no flavor. Down here we have uh it looks like a pate with a fruit combo. We got a little bit of blue cheese over here with some I think there's caramel on that blue cheese, dude. Whoa. I don't know where we are. Space. This looks like manego. What the hell is that? It's sticky. It's It's honeycomb. I can smell. It's super sweet. Spices on it or something. That's the stickiest object on the planet, but it's delicious. Lastly, some pickled vegetables with uh looks like hummus down there. It's a spiced hummus. I taste mostly cumin and oregano. It's all very Mediterranean. All right, let's try this blue cheese with caramel. Blue cheese with caramel is a is a clutch move. Like I'm not a huge blue cheese guy. That's a really good blue cheese. Very mild. The caramel on there surprisingly works. I might start trying to figure out some variation on that theme. All right, let's see what this pate is all about. All right. Yeah. Pate can be very meaty, very fatty. Sometimes it can taste very porky in that like barnyard smell kind of way. It's not necessarily a bad thing. like that is what a lot of people like in pate. I personally don't, but uh so I I'd say it's technically proficient without being my favorite thing in the world. Overall, cheese needs some cheese plate. It's really interesting. They're doing things differently and like experimenting in all the right ways. Still a very, you know, enjoyable charerie board. I'll give it I'll give it an eight. I think it's I think it's very enjoyable. It It's got some some odd choices. This This flapper is weird. This is weird. Um, the flavors and the sweetness of it are just bizarre. That's really the only thing keeping it from being a nine. God damn it, dude. Let me corner by myself in peace. Why are you back here again? I like cornering. All right, this is Boss Barabis. And I don't know what it is. It seems to have raisins on it. Or these are like They taste like prunes. What are small prunes? Prunes. In what galaxy? is plumes. I don't know. Not this galaxy. Not the galaxy's edge. Luckily, we're right at the edge, right? This is the edge. Found it. And you just jumped right over it. This is mossberry biscuit. It's got some mossberries on it, which or blueberries. They blueberries. Oh, yeah. They're little blueberries. Yeah. [Music] It's a very soft scone. There's no crumbliness or shortness to it, which is fine. Very soft scum. And it's just a sweetened uh royal icing on top. It's just a hardened icing. Uh no flavor to it. Just a maybe the blue is a flavor. The blue one has a little fruit flavor to it, but there's so little of it. I mean, look, there's barely any on there. You don't register it at all. So, it just tastes like a sweetened scone, which is nice. That's nice. And um the purple fuzz on top. What about the purple fuzz? I don't know. It It honestly tastes like stale bread. It tastes like a really dry, really dry cake. It's just okay. It's just there. I'm going to give it a five because it's But those colors, I want there to be so much fruit flavor and fruit intrigue and I'm not, you know, I'm just I'm I'm just I feel like I'm just watching the show from over the uh fence, you know, at Fenway. Let's get the hell out of here. So Brad was talking about uh you know what if we find the Disney magic today and I was like no dude I'm too grown for that. I'm too jaded and it was bitter scary dude that's the falcon but as soon as I set foot in there I saw how beautifully they had recreated Tatooine. I was a kid again. So Brad was right. Found the magic. Okay, I'm glad you noticed my helmet. All right, let's go.

7Qlgn6hKn9g,"Hello there. Welcome back to Anything with Alvin. Today, I decided it would be kind of fun to play around with some craft mac and cheese. Now, for me, this is pretty nostalgic, and I grew up with a lot of different ways to upgrade it and make it my own, and kind of feel like I was cooking at home. I feel like this is one of those foods where everybody kind of has their own ways to jazz it up with stuff they have at home, with stuff they, you know, can make with their friends. And honestly, one of the biggest reasons why I wanted to make this video was because there was a massive discount when you bought them in bulk. So, here we are. Let's have some fun today, shall we? And just a heads up, all these upgrades and combinations were either from personal datab banks or from scouring Reddit and the internet. So, thank you for your ingenuity, your ideas, and hopefully you get to see some of your favorites come to life. All right, first up, the Blake Lively. Now, according to the internet, she posted this on her Instagram story a while back. She said that she really loves mac and cheese, but she doesn't really use the traditional box recipe. Instead, she adds a heavy splash of milk, a third of block of cream cheese, and two handfuls of freshly grated cheese, specifically something sharp like a cheddar and a combination of a more milder cheese. Now, this one seems pretty fun. I do like the addition of cream cheese. So, let's give it a try. We're going to prepare the box as usual, except in these cases, I actually like to undercook the noodles by 3 minutes compared to the what they recommend on the box. Usually they say 6 to eight. I go for four cuz I think by the time you're done, you don't want them mushy. This helps them give a nice chew. So, go to boil the water, pour the noodles in, cook them for 4 minutes, drain them, and just like Blake Lively says, I'm going to add in a heavy splash of milk, third a block of cream cheese, two handfuls of freshly grated cheese, and mix together. And the result is really, really nice. This looks luscious. This cheesy. This looks so appetizing compared to the normal box, even though there's nothing against that. And I think the just by visuals alone, this is kind of those creamy mac and cheeses that if you like that kind of thing, this would definitely be your vibe. Almost like the thing you find at a side dish at like a fried chicken restaurant or something. All right, this is it. The Blake Lively mac and cheese hack. Let's give it a taste. Now, this is really good. The cream cheese adds such a nice tang, and you get a lot more of that sharpness from the cheese, but it still tastes like that delicious box mac flavor that we love, just upgraded. Next up, brown butter mac and cheese. Now, this is something that I personally wanted to try. Usually, when you make craft mac and cheese from the box, you add in butter and milk and all that good stuff, but I wanted to see if we can take up the flavor a little bit because if there's butter, I usually try and brown it. So, with the butter that they recommend, couple tablespoons, I'm just going to brown that slowly. I think the key to browning butter is making sure that you do it and scrape off the bottom the whole time so none of those residue bits get burned. And I take it to the color of Guinness is what a pastry chef once taught me. Usually people when they brown butter, they don't brown it all the way. I kind of like to take it to the edge where you're not sure if it's burnt. But the tricky thing is it can burn quite easily. So after taking it to a nice dark brown or burnette color, I'm going to pour in the noodles that we cooked off to the side. These are the same traditional noodles from the box. Just cook for four minutes in the water. And I want to toast these noodles a little bit first to get those aromomas going. And then just going to add in the splash of milk and cheese powder as normal. So the only difference between this one and the normal box mac and cheese is the fact that we brown the butter first and we toasted the noodle. So let's see if this actually does make a difference. Now from both a color and an aroma point of view, this is already clearly darker and more rich and just nuttier than the traditional one. And if you compare the taste, I would say the difference is pretty significant. You can immediately taste and smell the brown butter notes in it. And honestly, if you're just going to make traditional box mac and cheese according to the package instructions, then you have everything. I would say it's worth that little extra couple minutes to brown the butter cuz this will take that to the next level where it just takes off the edge of that typical box mac and cheese flavor and gives it a nice little upgrade without having to use any extra ingredients. Okay, next up, how about mac and cheese graton? This is kind of just making a typical breadcrumb topped mac and cheese, but with craft instead. So to start this off, I'm going to take some fresh mozzarella, some cheddar, and some Gouda and cut those into little tiny cubes. Then we're going to cook the craft box according to normal instructions. Now, when I say normal box instructions for these kinds of dishes, I actually omit the butter cuz there's a lot of cheese going into this. And I cook again for 4 minutes. So once those cheese box gets mixed in and everything looks nice and cheesy and gooey, I'm going to spread this around into a small cast iron pan. Then off to the side, I'm going to melt just a pad of butter and mix in a handful of seasoned panco breadcrumbs. You could also use regular breadrumbs or honestly if you have fresh breadrumbs that's great too. Mix that together. Throw that on top for a nice little crispy topping. And that's going to go into the oven at about 450° until it's nice and golden brown. Kind of a quicker way to dress up instant mac and cheese into something that's more commonly found on a dinner table in the middle of a party. This one, this got some nice crunch on the top. It's got some nice chewy cheesy goodness in the middle. This one is great. Crunch is there. Seasoning's there. It doesn't taste nearly as complex as if you made a complete homemade mac and cheese with your own special seasoned breadcrumb mixture and spent a couple hours on it. But I will say it is enough to where you could probably fool the majority of people if you needed something quick to bring to a party that didn't look like instant craft box mac and cheese. Honestly, I probably would have cooked the noodles for 3 minutes in this case cuz there's a lot of time in the oven. But I don't think people are worried about al dente noodles and mac and cheese that much. All right, let's move on to our next upgrade. Barbecue chicken mac and cheese. This one has a lot of the flavor components of a barbecue chicken pizza, such as red onions, rotisserie chicken, some scallions, barbecue sauce, and cheese. So, first up, I'm going to slice up these red onions. And just to break the rawness of those red onions, I'm going to throw those into the hot noodles and kind of let them wilt just a little bit so they don't have that sharp red oniony taste. Then, I'm going to add the splash of milk, a handful of rotisserie chicken or cooked chicken. You could probably use other meat if you really wanted to. So, rotisserie chicken, the cheese powder, some barbecue sauce, and scallions. To be honest, I don't really have any measurements for these. These are all by eye, and I'm sure you could probably just adjust according to how you'd like to make cuz I don't know about you guys, but I don't really measure things when making this kind of food at home. Give that a nice mix. And look at that. That's some nice looking barbecue chicken mac and cheese. Giving it a smell and giving it a taste. It does actually taste like, well, those like California Pizza Kitchens barbecue chicken pizza. It's got all those flavor notes. signature of the red onion, the barbecue sauce and the chicken and the cheese. And honestly, this is the most delicious one that I've had so far. I'm definitely going to be keeping an eye on this and eating it off camera as we make all the other ones. I think everything cancels out nicely. The sweetness, the tanginess, the cheesiness, the chicken. This is This is a knockout win. Now, this upgrade, this is a personal mac and cheese recipe. This reminds me of coming back home after a long day in seventh grade, finding mac and cheese in the pantry and finding some leftovers my mom had had in the fridge and kind of combining it to pretend I was a chef. So, first I'm going to take some butter and sear up some of this ground beef. Now, it's a lot of ground beef and I'm just going to set aside half of this because we're going to use the ground beef for later. And into this ground beef that we have remaining into the pan, I'm going to add a little bit of soy sauce and some honey to kind of almost give it that teriyak-ish, you know, soy flavor that I really enjoy and it's really easy to make. And once that's all done, the beef is going to get removed. I'm going to delaze that pan or pot with hot water and cook the noodles in that. That way, we get as much flavor as we can. After the noodles are cooked according to how we normally do it, I'm going to add in the ground beef, which has been glazed with soy and honey, some chopped scallions, and the cheese powder, milk, everything, everything good. Give it a mix. This is comfort to me. This is nostalgia. This is my one of my first attempts at trying to cook at home as a young kid. And it tastes delicious. Everything goes together. There's no real cohesive theme to it, but you put ground beef with soy and scallions and cheese together, it tastes like tastes like home. and it's really, really, really good. I didn't mess around as a kid. All right, the next upgrade. We're going to go ahead and make taco mac and cheese. Some cheddar, ground beef, starred salsa, lime juice, and some paprika. So, we got some cheddar that I'm going to grate. After that's done, I'm going to go ahead and make the craft box like normal. I'm going to add in the ground beef that we had from earlier, some salsa from the jar, that grated cheddar, the cheese powder, and a little bit of lime juice. And for seasoning, I thought we had taco seasoning, but we actually didn't. So, I'm going to use some smoked paprika cuz that's kind of similar. It has a nice smoky flavor, and I like that. So, that's going to go in two. Give it a nice mix. Put it in a bowl. Top with a little bit more paprika. And yeah, that's tacoish mac and cheese, I guess. Has a little bit of those flavors. And I think the jarred salsa and the ground beef really take this to the next level and go really, really well with the cheesy flavors of the box. Very solid all the way through. Pretty quick considering that a lot of the stuff probably came from the supermarket. Ready to go. All right. Up next is a Cajun style mac and cheese. This one we got some sausages, red onions, garlic, and scallions. First, I'm going to cut up those sausages. I'm going to slice up the red onion. Slice up the garlic. Slice up some scallions. And over to the stove we go. And goes a little bit pat of butter. First, I'm going to cook off the garlic until it starts to get a little bit brown around the edges. Then, I'm going to go ahead and start cooking the onions until there's a little bit of color on those as well. Then those go into some cooked craft noodles. While that hangs out on the side, I'm going to sear the sausage to make sure that we get some nice color and get the fat and juices out of it. Those going to get tossed into the noodles. And instead of putting the milk directly into the mac and cheese, I'm just going to delaze this nice delicious pan with the milk first and then pour that in. Then we're going to combine everything else with the powder as normal. Also add a little bit of Old Bay for that Cajunesque flavor. And then yeah, that's our Cajun style mac and cheese with the sausage and the onions and all the good stuff and aromatics in there. This one is delicious. It's hearty. It's flavorful. If you wanted to add extra Cajun seasoning, I'm sure that could work, too. But I feel like the flavors that we have going on already are great. Yeah. All right. Up next is a kaco pepe style mac and cheese. I apologize to the Italians watching, but sometimes you just kind of want those flavors and you might not have that much time. We're going to create the box mac just as normal, but instead I'm going to use half of the cheese packet. Going to grate some fresh pecarino romano cheese in there. Some good handfuls of that. as well as some healthy cranks of black pepper. It mix this all together and as a hybrid between instant mac and cheese and ketchay pepe, this is pretty good. It does the trick if you want those nice cheesy peppery flavors, but it doesn't require all the fuss of necessarily having everything and all the ingredients to make the whole thing. I think this is a nice little upgrade that could just be used with some extra cheese cuz chances are you probably have black pepper lying around. Okay, next up, more of a greener, more vegetably, but not necessarily healthier version. pesto mac and cheese. I thought that having things like cherry tomatoes and pesto would be a nice contrast to the cheesiness of the mac and cheese. So, this one's pretty simple. Cut the cherry tomatoes in half. Fill those into the noodles. Mix them around till those cherry tomatoes get a little bit warm but not mushy. Add in the cheese powder, a good healthy spoonful or two of the pesto, and just mix it up. And yeah, everything works together nice. I can't see why any of this would not go with each other. And it's just a nice little way to jazz up your mac and cheese if you have some vegetables and a little halfeaten jar of pesto in your fridge cuz it works. All right, the next one. Pizza mac and cheese. This one's a little bit more fun and a little bit more involved with some dry ms. Going to chop them up into a little cubes. Take some of this pepperoni. Chop those up in a little little pieces. And then into our craft box that we prepared normally. I'm going to mix all those things in along with little gug of marinara sauce. Once that's all mixed together, we already you could technically eat this as is. It's pizza mac and cheese already, but we're going to take this a step further. You're going to pour this mixture into a steel pan. Spread it flat. Top this with a little bit of marinara sauce all over it. Top with a little bit more fresh mats and a lot of pepperoni. I've learned to cover the entire surface area, whatever you're baking with pepperoni cuz they're going to shrink. This is going to go into the oven at 400°. And even though this looks like one of those like crazy internet food creations we do for the sake of doing it, which it technically is, this one is actually really, really good. I was shocked by how good this was. There's a lot of depth of flavor. Tastes like pizza. It It actually was really good that it was claimed immediately as leftovers. Yeah, that's a winner, too. All right, this next one for a little bit more something substantial and somewhat balanced. Broccoli cheddar chicken, which I definitely saw a lot of people making at home online. So, first we're going to chop up some frozen broccoli fuettes into little pieces. Going to grate some fresh cheddar. You have this rotisserie chicken here. I mean, this one's pretty simple. You kind of take these things, prepare the craft box as normal, and throw all those things in with the sour cream, the milk, and the cheese powder, and you just give it a big old mix. And out comes a somewhat more substantial and balanced meal. You have some extra vegetables and protein in there. And cuz broccoli and cheddar is a pretty classic combination. This tastes really good. And along with the tanginess of the sour cream delight, I can see this being something that you might want to, you know, make on a more consistent basis. That would work well in almost any situation. You could probably even throw more cheddar and broil it in the oven if you really wanted to. All right, on to the next one, which again was commented by a lot of people, especially on Reddit, that seem to just love making this at home. Just tuna and peas mac and cheese. Very easy. You got your craft box, you got your canned tuna, you got frozen peas at home, you could just throw this together. Nothing too crazy about it. Make the box as normal. Add in the drained important can of tuna and some frozen peas. Stir it up until it's all nice and good. And yeah, this is again substantial. The saltiness and the fishiness of the tuna gets counteracted by the cheese. And the peas kind of help break through that with their own green little bubbles of pea stuff. Not necessarily my favorite one compared to the other ones, but definitely something that would work in a pinch and could probably be a staple if you just had these things lying around and didn't want to, you know, spend too much money making food. All right, next up, some bacon egg mac and cheese. Heavy emphasis on the bacon here. All right, first we're going to cut our egg I mean, uh, we're going to we're going to cut our bacon into little chunks. I'm going to crisp it up in a pan until we have nice crispy bits and some bacon fat. Toss our bacon into the pot of cooked craft noodles. And definitely set aside some of that grease. We don't need all of it. And cook the egg and the remaining bacon fat. What's great about this one is that instead of butter, you can use bacon fat instead to flavor your mac and cheese. Once the egg is a nice sunny side up, mix those things up as normal. And yes, once again, we are going to add scallions. One thing I've learned is just like in ramen of any form, scallions tend to go really, really, really well with mac and cheese. Both in color, flavor, and texture. Okay, the egg goes on top. I'm going to top this with scallions. Crack some black pepper. And this is our beautiful bacon egg. Mac and cheese. Let's go ahead and pop that egg yolk cuz that is the rule. Spread that over. Get a nice bite. Yeah, this is delicious. Bacon, funny as it is, cuts through the mac and cheese with its smoky and saltiness, although not necessarily in health, but this one is a winner. Yeah, I'll I'll just let Tony take this one because he really likes this one. I wouldn't eat this for breakfast, but it does taste really, really, really good. All right, buffalo chicken mac and cheese. This one is something that Steve actually likes to make a lot. He said pretty simple. Rotissery chicken, hot sauce, got some cream cheese. Yeah, we're just going to take all these ingredients, prepare a craft box according to normal package instructions, which is minus 3 minutes on the cook timer for the noodles, and just mix everything in and give it a bite. The tanginess and the spiciness from the hot sauce counteracts a lot of the stuff. The cream cheese has a nice little body to it. And this one is It tastes exactly like what it sounds like. And it is good. I'll give this one to Steve. He wants this one. Saves him a step at home. All right. Now, this is the one that I've been really excited for. This one is a steak and caramelized onion mac and cheese. So, here we have some red onions that we going to slice up really thinly. And I have over here some boneless short rib. I'm going to take these and cut these into little chunks and make sure that they get a nice sear in the pan with a little bit of butter before they're taken off to the side with some black pepper. I like short rib because it's very versatile. You can overcook it and you can cook it medium rare and it'll still be delicious because it's one of those cuts where even though if you get it well done and past well done, it'll either braze and break down or it'll still be nice somehat chewy and flavorful, which I think is really good for applications like these where you don't necessarily know what kind of meat you want to use. So, in the same pan that we cooked the beef, we're going to sear the onions and get a nice color on it, using up those remaining beef juices and fat. And then, just to add a little bit of acidity, I'm going to add some splashes of honey and vinegar to make sure we have a nice acidic component that will go with our cheese and our steak. And yeah, after we combine the onions into our typical craft box mix, I'm actually going to not throw the steak inside, although I'm sure you could, but just for presentations and texture sake, I'm actually going to plate the steak on half of it on top of the bowl. And this is a black pepper short rib and caramelized red onion mac and cheese. Definitely a little bit on the fancier side. You know, the steak probably costs way more than the box and everything else combined, but it is one of those things where, you know, you want to get some luxury on the quick. This one undoubtedly tastes really, really, really good. Those nice juicy fatty short rib chunks go really well with the cheese and the onions are such a nice welcome bite with the vinegar, the onion flavor, and a little bit of sweetness from the honey. This one's an all-around winner. I personally had to fight a little bit to make sure I could get some extra bites in before everybody else took this one down. That one's a winner. All right. Now, something that I've personally done a few times at home. This next one is chili crisp mac and cheese or laama or laan mac and cheese. First up, I'm going to slice up this garlic and scallions. Going hard with the aromatics on this one cuz again in Chinese cuisine, garlic and scallions are very, very, very prevalent. This one is all about the aromatics. Once our garlic and our scallions have been nice and prepared into a pot, I'm going to heat up some chili oil and cook the garlic in it directly. So that way we get some nice flavors going on in the pot before anything else starts. And before the garlic starts to get brown, I'm going to throw in the scallion whites, making sure that they cook down a little bit because they are a little bit sharper than the greens. Then into this mixture, I'm going to delaze with some black vinegar, Chinese black vinegar, and honey to add some sweetness. And then we throw in the cooked craft noodles we had set aside. Then everything else kind of goes in typically as normal. the milk. Splash the cheese powder, the scallion greens. Mix that up. A little bit more chili crisp in there cuz why not? And we're going to plate this up. And you know what? Just going to put a little bit more chili crisp on top as well because it's really hard to not be really addicted to this stuff. And this one is Yeah, this one is the lan mac and cheese. One thing I've actually seen served at restaurants, although probably not the instant box version. And this one is not surprisingly to me, but maybe to other people, very good. So much flavor coming from the chili oil combining with the cheese as well as the garlic and the scallions. Kind of has all those strong, you know, alium flavors melding really well with the cheesy mellow flavors with the mac and cheese. This one is a winner, especially if you have any uh people that really like chili crisp. That's one way to get them really excited. And the color is beautiful from the chili oil as well. Okay, this next one I kind of thought would be fun to try to play around with cuz I've seen people make French onion soup dip, but I thought, what if you just threw it into mac and cheese instead and make French onion mac and cheese? Cuz technically a French onion soup also has cheese in it. So, into our typically prepared craft box, I'm going to throw in a packet of the soup mix, a good couple of spoonfuls of sour cream, and mix in everything normally. And just for some extra cheesy flavor, I'm going to grate in some guru cheese right at the end to kind of emulate what you would have in a French onion soup with the cheese on top. Yeah, this one tastes oniony cheesy. It's one easy way to get that onion flavor into your mac and cheese without having to cut up any, especially if you already have a pack of this lying around. It's really good. You probably even use bread if you really wanted those extra carbs, but this tastes good enough on its own. In the same vein of using prepackaged products that you probably have in the pantry, cream of mushroom was another one that I saw on the internet. I think this was on Reddit. So, first we're going to chop up some onions. Saute them in a little bit of butter to get some nice sauteed onions for some extra oomph. The cream of onion soup comes out from the can in a nice satisfying few glops. Go in with our sauteed onions. Mix in with the milk and the cheese powder. And even though this is a little bit on the saltier side, I still say this is a really nice way to get the mushroom flavor in and jazz up both instant products into one not instant product technically because 1 plus 1 equals square in this scenario. All right, this next one is uh taking a note out of Andrew's book. We're going to do some hot dog stuff. This one is chili dog mac. I'm going to take these packet of hot dogs, chop them up. And Tony actually brought in a amazing rotating cheese grater, which blew my mind compared to the traditional box method because all you got to do is push it down and rotate it and all the force you're applying actually gets used efficiently in the right way. I love this thing. After the cheese is grated, going to give those hot dogs a nice sear. Mix in the chili, the hot dogs, the cheddar, and well, you know me, some scallions into the prepared mac and cheese box. Add a splash of milk, some more cheddar. Mix that in until it's nice and delicious looking. And more cheese and scallions on top just for some color. Cuz now it actually looks like good chili. And the flavors, I think you can imagine it goes pretty well together. Once again, taking two packaged instant products ready to go into one beautiful new thing. and jazz it up with some scallions, hot dogs, and cheese, and you got a whole dish. Definitely a party pleaser for sure. Not surprised that this ended up on or is already on like TGI Friday's menus. Okay, now we're just having fun here. We're making chicken bacon ranch mac and cheese. As you can see, I got some frozen chicken nuggets here. You probably use dino nuggets cuz that's what I grew up with at home. I chop those up, toast them into a pan until they're nice and golden brown all around. I'm going to prepare the box of mac and cheese as normal. And instead of just mixing everything up, which I'm sure would be delicious, I'm going to layer these things. First goes in the mac, followed by a sprinkle of chicken nuggets, that's a funny sentence to say, followed by some bacon, which has already been cooked, crisped up, and chopped up. And a drizzle of ranch, not too heavy, and it sounds insane, but I'm curious to how this will turn out because chicken, bacon, ranch, for some reason, it works like a charm. We're going to repeat that layer one more time with the mac and cheese, the remaining chicken nuggets, the bacon, a little topping of ranch, which again sounds very funny as a sentence. And this is going to go into the oven at 400 until it's nice and brown and bubbly. Top this with a few scallions. And let's dig in. Now, you might be a little hesitant, and I was too. I was a little apprehensive on the fact that it might taste just like too much and weird. But this was shockingly delicious. Everything went together so well. This is one of those things where you take it, your eyes goes wide, and instead of just saying words, you start clapping and pointing at it and nodding your head. Yeah, this was a certified banger for sure. Even though it's not good for your health by any means, this is very, very, very good. Probably one of the best ones we made yet. I think baking it also added a nice little crunch and caramelization to whatever the heck touched the pan, so it wasn't all this gloppy ranch baconyy mess. This is a winner. Okay, we're going to go for another direction here. Let's go for spam kimchi mac and cheese. Kimchi mac and cheese has definitely been popular in the restaurant world. It goes well on so many menus considering the fact that a lot of the flavors from kimchi and kochu jang and Korean cuisine goes well with cheese and is commonly served with cheese in Korea and in Korean restaurants. So, this one just makes sense. I'm going to chop up some spam, fry those up with some scallion whites we've chopped up to get some flavor going. Take this kimchi, throw that in, and sauté it so those nice raw flavors kind of get cooked out a little bit. Becomes a little bit more mellow. And dump that into our cooked noodles from our box mac and cheese. And I'm going to delaze the pan really quickly with the milk. Pour that into our noodles and add in the ku jang and cheese powder along with scallion greens. Once everything's all mixed together. Yeah, this is some nice kimchi spam mac and cheese. Color-wise, flavor-wise, everything makes sense. It goes together well. I can see why this is quite popular at restaurants. This one is a winner as well. Almost gives the same vibe of adding American cheese to shin rammen or something like that. Both have the spiciness and fermented flavor from the kimchi going well with the cheese. So, yeah, this one's a good one. almost in a way kind of tastes like purijig or Korean army stew which also has like ramen noodles, spice, spam, and American cheese and scallions. Maybe that's just one of the formulas for good food. All right, clearly you've seen me use too many scallions at this point. So, I'd say why not? Let's just go ahead and make a scallion lover mac and cheese. I've actually had this idea in my head for a while based on some stuff I do at home. So, we have a lot of scallions here and a good amount of garlic as well. So, what I'm going to do is cut these scallions up roughly, not into slices, but more like chunks and stocks. For this method, they don't need to be precise. So, first I'm going to blanch all these scallions in boiling water for about half a minute or so. I don't want them to turn dark like gray green or yellow green. I want them to still be bright. So, once they take out, I'm going to put in our garlic, which has not been blanched. And then going to season this with a good pinch of salt and a little bit of sugar and immersion blend this. This is actually a sauce and a condiment that I keep at home almost all the time. It's like a scallion garlic puree that actually my friend Eric from 886 and onewin taught me. He kind of uses this as a condiment for his restaurant in a different version and recipe and I took inspiration from that and uses as kind of like a nice flavor edition sauce at home. Got this nice beautiful green color. I think he roasts his but I think blanching helps maintain that green color. And once it's all blended together we have a nice delicious scallion garlic puree. Now, this is going to go directly into our prepared box of craft mac and cheese along with our cheese powder. And if you really like scallions, you're going to like this one a lot. If you don't like scallions, you probably won't want to eat this one. But since I like scallions, I think this one is really delicious. It's a lot of that bite to it and it really goes well together because you have the cheese and the milk and you have the scallions and that's just that's just a good time. Okay, now we've gotten to the point where we've made a lot of mac and cheeses and we have leftovers. And this is actually the Blake Lively one that we made from earlier. It was left over and it's in the fridge. And well, what do you do, right? If you can't finish mac and cheese. Well, one thing I found that you can do, you can turn it into grilled cheese because the mac and cheese already has so much soft, you know, starch and milk and cheese inside of it that it's a natural conveyor belt to turn it into something more delicious. So, two nice slices of sourdough. We're going to go down and I got some pieces of, you know, sharp cheddar that we have slices of. I lay that down on the bread. And I take out the mac and cheese and use it as almost like a spread. Sandwiching that on top of the two slices of cheese and putting the remaining two slices of cheese over that and finishing off with the bread. Now, this is going to go into a pan with a little bit of butter and sear for about 5 to 7 minutes on low",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
heat with a lid is what I've learned for thicker grilled cheese to try to get everything warmed through. Let's give that a flip. Wow, that is a nice crust. I like that crust. That's a nice crust. I'm going to flip that. Let the other side go for another five to seven minutes. And ta grilled mac and cheese. This is uh Let's give this a cross-section. Some nice crunching. There it is. I'm sure you could use as many other cheeses as you want that would probably melt a little bit better. But from a flavor point of view, this is good. Tony really liked this one. I was a little too full to be honest to eat more at this point. So Tony had to take one for the team and he gladly did and will do again for this sandwich. Crispy, crusty. Was sneaking bites of it as we were shooting the other ones. This one's a winner. All right. In the theme of leftovers, we do have a lot of ingredients left over from all those other ones we did. Uh, we have a lot of meat. We're going to call this one the meat lover supreme mac and cheese. Using up as many leftovers as we can. Chop up the remaining amount of spam. Chop up the sausage. Chop up the pepperoni. And throw in some mushrooms and onions to make sure that we have something to add some bulk. And to counteract the flavors of all this meat and cheese we're about to throw in. We're going to grate up all the random blocks of leftover cheese from the shoot in Tony's grater, as well as the random ones we found in the fridge that we could use. And once that's all done, I'm going to take two pans this time. I'm going to brown the meats, trying to get those fats and oils and juices all seared up nice and deliciously. And in one pan, after the meats are done, I'm going to throw in the mushrooms. And in the other pan, I'm going to throw in the onions and cook these individually until they are nice and delicious. And once they're all good and really browned up, going to go into this one glorious meat, mushroom, onion mixture. And then we're going to cook two boxes of instant mac and cheese according to normal instructions. And we're going to throw in all of the grated cheese we had from earlier along with the leftover sour cream, a heavy, heavy, heavy splash of milk, and all of that delicious, glorious browned up meat, mushroom, onion mixture until we have this deliciousness. And then finally, a heavy dose of scallion whites, which will hopefully help fight back all that intense flavor from everything else. Give it a nice big mix. This is our meatlover supreme deluxe leftover everything cheese, meat, cream, onion, mushroom mac and cheese. And yeah, this one was very, very, very, very good. I uh may or may not have claimed most of this to take home by myself. This was a fun one. I learned a lot about mac and cheese. And I would say one of the biggest takeaways is that it is nice to have scallions in the fridge when making anything at home because one, they go really, really well with mac and cheese. And two, this box is a lot more versatile than I thought. I would say that you can almost add in anything you want and the cheese and the noodles kind of become this bed for almost any kind of seasoning and flavor that you want to infuse. You might be wondering, you guys didn't finish all of that, did you? There's no way you could have eaten every single thing. And you're right, we didn't. After every finished recipe, we immediately placed into a tea container and Tony was kind enough to label all of them. These are all of our leftovers. These are some of the ones that I feel like really stood out to me in flavor and just creativeness and and how much I'd want to eat it again and how much I was shocked at how good they were. And don't worry, Tonyy's going to take home a lot and I'm going to make sure that these mac and cheeses find a nice home at some of the restaurants that I like going to. Their staff are probably very hungry and I'm sure they could probably use this as part of their staff meal. So, these will all be going to the right people. There's probably so many other combinations that people like to do that I haven't even touched. And I'm sure you have your own favorite combinations as well that you like to do at home. Whether it's a variation of these, whether it's a new one, the ingenuity that I've found on the internet for people who like to make box mac and cheese knows no bounds. So," I hope this inspires you to uh play around with your whatever you got lying around at home and hopefully find other ways to enjoy this nice little blue box.

YW5pQYyPOms,"I got about four pounds of baby Yukons here, which I'm just going to cut in half. Then I'm going to add the potato slices to a pot full of water, which first I'm going to heavily salt and add a splash of vinegar. Place the pot on a stove and get it up to a boil. Keep it there for like 10 12 minutes. So I got three ears of sweet corn here that I'm going to toss with a little bit of oil before placing on our preheated grill.

_iDrJhAdqXM,"Breakfast burgers. Burgers that you eat for breakfast. So just a burger, but it's got breakfast stuff on it, which it's still just a burger, but it's for breakfast. What makes an actual breakfast burger? What would the ideal breakfast burger be? I want something that has the spirit of a pancake, but the body of a bun, just like me. Egg. I think I'm going to go sunny side up with a nice runny yolk fried in Danish crearyy butter. I'm going to make them yeasted pancakes. That's easy enough. But then I'm going to do something that runs counter to every instinct and voice of knowledge I've ever heard, which is I'm going to beat the hell out of this pancake batter. I'm make it nice and thick, and I'm going to whisk it within an inch of its life. I want these pancakes to have a little body for your teeth to sink into them a little bit. So, I'm going to make, I think, something entirely new. Then again, nothing's entirely new. Now, on to the burger patty. I'm going to add some dried spices. A little bit of dried sage, some dried garlic, some dried onion powder. Just a little bit. I don't want it to taste like breakfast sausage. For sweetness, I'm going to roast some thick cut bacon and brush it down with maple syrup. And all in all, we should end up with a burger form factor that is well and truly breakfast. Something that you'd feel weird eating at 4 in the afternoon.

0y27oRNuoYM,"Oh no, no, no, no, no. Am I a genius? What's happening? Here we go. Okay, that's delicious. Breakfast burgers. Burgers that you eat for breakfast. So, just a burger, but it's got breakfast stuff on it, which still just a burger, but it's for breakfast. So, uh breakfast burgers, uh a little hard to define. Like, you know, obviously there's a runny egg on there. Usually there's some bacon, but you could put a runny egg and bacon on a normal burger and I'd still eat it for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. What makes an actual breakfast burger? What would the ideal breakfast burger be? So, today I'm going to meet up with the burger king. Not that one, the real one. George Moes is the chef and owner of Hamburger America, the best smash burger in New York City, probably the world. And he's going to give me a little insight into what his favorite breakfast style burger is. and we're going to brainstorm together what is the ultimate breakfast burger. Let's go. This episode of Brunch with Babish is brought to you by Danish Crearyy. Churned to 85% butter fat for extra rich taste and extra creamy texture. Danish crearyy European style butter is the secret ingredient to leveling up almost any dish, including today's breakfast burger. Danish crearyy's butter is an innovative blend of Danish heritage and American innovation, and the product simply speaks for itself.

Thank you so much for having me. Thanks for coming in. Well, I I've never tried your the burger here because I can't get in. It's too too many lines, too many people. See, you can get in. I'll I'll slow Monday at uh 3 p.m. No dude. All right, folks. I'll see you there at 3 p.m. Every Monday, I'm going to be here. So, we're here today to talk about breakfast burgers. How do you feel about breakfast burgers? I think any burger that's you eat before noon is a breakfast burger. I'm going to make you the ultimate breakfast burger. What like what what what does that look like to you? Like are the buns like Do we go sweet for the buns or something like that? No, I I'm not a big fan of sweet buns, so I would much rather air on the on the savory side of things. To me, a burger has to be something that is going to be a vehicle for getting it into your face. Okay. So, sure, if I had waffles, they're not yeasty, but they're definitely bread. I was going to say a a yeasted pancake or waffle, maybe that would do it. So, you do need some sweetness in a burger because you want to create a a flavor profile that's that's complex. Yeah. So, it has to have a little bit of the yeast on the bun is so good. It's got to be savory, obviously. It's salty side. It's have to have it has to have some kind of sugar and always good if you have a crunch in there as well. sort of covers all of the different um all different things you want to have in your mouth at the same time. So, what I'm going to try to do is take that information. I'm going to try to make a breakfast burger. Okay. If I bring it back to you here, will you try bite? Hey, if you're cooking, I'm I'm eating. All right. Thanks so much, man. So, George had a couple interesting thoughts there. The most interesting of which I thought was pancakes. Pancakes as buns. Now, it'd be easy enough to just whip up some, you know, smaller pancakes and use them as buns. I guarantee there's some frozen thing in Trader Joe's that does exactly that. Not today. Traditional pancakes are very, very sweet, very enriched, very short, very delicate, very absorbent. None of these things do does a great hamburger bun make. I want something that has the spirit of a pancake, but the body of a bun, just like me. So, what I'm going to do first to bring the yeasty flavor that George said is so important, I'm going to make them yeasted pancakes. That's easy enough. But then I'm going to do something that runs counter to every instinct and voice of knowledge I've ever heard, which is I'm going to beat the hell out of this pancake batter, make it nice and thick, and I'm going to whisk it within an inch of its life so that it develops gluten. I want these pancakes to have a little body for your teeth to sink into them a little bit. This is not something you never normally want when making pancakes, but in a burger bun context, I think we need to sort of meet halfway. So, I'm going to make I think something entirely new. Then again, nothing's entirely new. Now, on to the burger patty. I know he'd probably kill me if he heard me say this, but I'm going to add some dried spices to this patty. Just a little reminiscent of breakfast. A little bit of dried sage, some dried garlic, some dried onion powder. The things that you might find in breakfast sausage, just a little bit. I don't want it to taste like breakfast sausage. I want it to taste like a breakfast burger. Egg. I think I'm going to go sunny side up with a nice runny yolk. For sweetness, I'm going to roast some thick cut bacon. And toward the end of roasting, I'm going to brush it down with maple syrup. Just enough to give it a little glaze and a little bit of sweetness and just inform the maple flavor. And all in all, we should end up with a burger form factor that is well and truly breakfast. Something that you'd feel weird eating at 4 in the afternoon. That's my goal. It's a weird goal to have, but and it's a first, I think. I don't I bet nobody's ever set out like I'm going to make a sandwich or food that you would feel weird eating it for. I'm a trailblazer. So, let's get started. First thing we have to do is make a a kind of a preferment. All I want to do is invent a whole new kind of pastry slash baked good on my first try. Is that so much to ask? I'm going to add one packet of active dry. And let's give it some sugar to munch on. Yeast loves sugar. It's just like us. 20 g of sugar in there. Plenty for the yeast to snack on and plenty to make these bun cakes. Bun cakes. They better turn out good now because that that's a million-dollar name. To make these bun cakes distinctly sweet, but not cloyingly so. So, 150 g of water, 100 g of milk. I'm going to heat the milk and water mixture to about 105 110° F. Little warm just to get the yeast woken up. Get to work. Sit at your desk. Do your job. Fart out some carbon dioxide and make some bubbles. I'm gonna add that to this flour and yeast mixture. Yeah, just a cursory stir there. Get everybody together. It's going to depend on your oven, but my oven when I leave the lights on for 20 minutes gets to be about a balmy 88 to 95° in there. If I leave it any longer, it starts to get too hot. So, I'm going to set a timer for once. Okay, it's been about 45 minutes and our pre-ferment has lived up to its namesake because it has pre- fermented into a nice bubbly, yeasty, alive, and active mixture. 425 g of bread flour. And now I have a remaining 150 g of milk. I'm going with buttermilk this time. That's hopefully going to keep these a little tender. Like buttermilk has a tenderizing effect. Adds a little bit of tang. So hopefully it will keep these from getting too tough. I'm also going to add one egg. This is normally not in a an English muffin recipe. This is what's turning it into a uh English buffin. English bun bunin. What do we call these before? Roll cakes. Cake roll. No, bun cake. Bun bun cakes. That it sounds like bun cake. We'll figure it out. Which I'm adding straight to the buttermilk and I'm beating up just to make sure that we don't end up with any streaks in there. These are both room temperature, by the way. You don't want cold. There we go. In it goes. And 40 g of Danish crearyy unsalted butter because that could have gone real wrong, but it went just right. Because we're going to add our own salt. 2 and 1/2 teaspoons worth of salt. I have no idea this is going to work. So, let's hope for the best. What I'm looking for is like a true halfway point between is this a dough or is it a batter? Cross your butts. I'm thinking that like this should be thick enough that I can't pour it, but I can I with I take oiled hands and I can shape it and I can measure out like an amount and drop it in my ring mold to fry it. Maybe I just fry it as is. So many things to try. Also, as you can see, I'm doing something you'd normally never do anywhere near pancakes, which is I'm mixing it thoroughly. I want decent gluten development. This needs to be, you know, something that has texture and toothsomeness to it. Can't be all crumbly and tender, just like a pancake. This is kind of exactly what I was picturing. If this were bread dough, I'd be like, shoot, overhydrated. If this were pancake batter, I'd be like, oop, I made bread by accident. But for our purposes, that's just about right. That's kind of exactly what I was picturing. It's a really cool consistency cuz if you if you work fast, it doesn't stick. But if you linger for even a second too long, it sticks. Look at that. That's beautiful. I'm loving this. All right. Whoa. Probably just broke that scale. Hit it with a clean, moist kitchen towel. Top it up with a plate. You got yourself a relatively sealed off dough that's not going to dry out. This guy I'm going to let um bulk ferment at room temp for 45 minutes. It seems like it was very active when I got it started. 45 minutes. I think that these need to be shaped into pseudo rolls. And let's start shaping these suckers. Oh yeah, it's poofing up real nice. Really nice Douglas. Very expensive. stop throwing it at the scale. So, I'm just going to kind of roll these into a ball and then I'm going to pat them out into a flat ball. Maybe give them a little stretchy poo. There we go. And I am going to wrap this plastic a little tight cuz I don't want them growing up too much. Just out. This is probably a bad idea actually cuz that's going to make them absorb the oil. See if I can still do this. Yeah, buddy. That was the coolest I've ever done in my entire life. Let's let these guys rise. My poofy guys are looking poofed, so I'm going to try frying them in butter. Danish crearyy butter. I think that is going to further differentiate them from English muffins. Okay. See what that guy does. Here we go. Okay. Uhoh. That looks  good. Oh no. Oh no. No. No. No. No. Yeah. That looks good. That looks  good, dude. I've never seen anything like that. I don't know. I think we I think we might be on to something here. Butter frying English. If even if this is still just an English muffin, like butter frying English m that's what I'm doing from now on. That crust is second to none. All right, we might have something here. We might. We just might. They look like pancakes. I think they look like pancakes. All right, I'm roasting the bacon for two reasons. First off, because it's super thick, and second, because I want to glaze it with a little bit of maple syrup, and it's very easy to burn in a pan. So, I'm just going to roast it till it's almost done. Brush it down with maple. Throw it back in. Let it sort of caramelize, crystallize a little bit. We'll have ourselves some very, very lightly maple flavored bacon. Okay, as if on quue, our bacon is emerged. Not quite done. Don't worry. What we're going to do is give it a flip and give it a brush. George was particularly perturbed by the idea of the burger being too sweet. So, this is really not to introduce too much sweetness, more to inform a flavor. Just enough so that your brain cross references it with the pancake like bun and says, ""Oh yeah, I know what's going on here."" As they head back into the oven, let's check out the bread. They're thinner than I would like. I think our final product, I'll try to get them a little bit taller and prouder. I can toast up one of these guys. Yeah, it's really not getting much toasting action because it's not making that much contact. So, if I go English muffin style toaster, if I go stove top style, we got to we got to do it right. I think the the bread needs like an element of something, whether it's like mustard or maple or something like maple mustard perhaps. Nico and I just had a tetat and I think we settled upon something brilliant. He said, ""You need something like maple or mustard spread on the bread."" And I was like, ""What about maple mustard, motherucker?"" And then we our shirts flew off and we chest bumped. And it it was awesome. It was awesome. So now I'm going to let me do that real quick. I'm going to do 3 tablespoons worth of maple syrup. honey mustard. Next time you get chicken strips, god damn it, I'm getting it more of it on me than in me. Whoa. That's exciting. That's an exciting condiment. I like that a great deal. I could see that working in a number of breakfasty or even savory applications, maybe with more mustard. That's delicious. I love honey mustard and all, but this this gives a whole new dimension to it. So, now we got to talk beef. I'm definitely doing smash burgers, which means that I can do something a little naughty, which is season the burger meat a little bit. Something you normally never want to do because it will ruin the burger's texture. But I'm just going to throw a little bit of breakfast sausage flavor in there. Nothing too crazy. Just a little bit of sage, some garlic powder, onion powder, a little bit of uh chili flake, and some salt and pepper. Don't want to overwork it, but again, these are smashies. They're going to be pretty forgiving. So, now roll these into little 3 oz balls. Okay, bacon's done right on time. Beautiful. This bacon is going to be hot as because it's buried in sugar, but also it's going to be soft and and and uh pliable. I want it to be pretty pretty crisp. So, we're going to let that cool off for a sec. I am ready to make a burger. Let's grab our very prettiest one. What the hell do we call these? And I want to give this a really pro slice. So, I'm going to little bit higher. Just a just a a slice of American cheese is worth. Perfect. Oh, cuts like a dream. All right. Yeah, that's going to grill up real nice, I think. All right, let's toast those up real quick using, of course, some delicious Danish crearyy butter. Get that nice and toasty. That's one thing I learned from George is you got you can't you can't be conservative with the butter. The other thing is like these are resilient. I think it's it's so necessary for so many reasons to knead it for as long as we did because like if you press down on a pancake the way that I'm pressing down on this, you destroy it. But this has structural integrity. It has elasticity, bounce back. Like I kind of love it. When you toast buns like this, you're going to want to let them cool on a wire rack. Otherwise, condensation is going to build up between them and your surface and form what is so dreaded by Fraser Crane as toast sweat. Um, so make sure that this is going to keep them from getting soggy and you you won't lose the nice crisp that you built here. All right, I think we're ready to start doing stuff. We got a nice smoking hot cast iron skillet with a little bit of oil. Actually, yeah. Let's make sure we got room here. I'm putting them down, letting them get a little bit of crust. It's going to make them easier to flip. All right, I'm going to give these a little flip. Inspect their brownness. the beautiful browns. I'm going to make sure that they're well spaced apart. Make sure the heat's nice and high. And here we go. We got to make these big smear them out. Doesn't even matter if there's holes. It's fine, especially on a double. Now I'm grabbing my ring mold. I'm going to thoroughly butter this guy with some DCB. DCB. Just make sure that egg doesn't stick. And drop that right next to the burgers. A little butter. [Applause] Carefully crack. Let's give these burgers a flip. I think they're just about there. Nice. Let's hit them with one slice of cheese. I think two is going to be too much. And just let things come up to temp here. Let's spread down some of our maple mustard. I think I'm going to do that on both sides cuz I really liked it. Just a little. Not like special sauce. We don't want it dripping down and melting in with the beef and everything. It's just there to inform a flavor. So, classic stack formation. We're going to grab one uh burger, put it on top of the other to really melt the cheese. Just needs to firm up the whites a little bit. In the meantime, we can retrieve the burgers. That was the top. Drop them down a little too small. I will forgive it. I'm going to take this bacon and I'm going to chop it up. I think I learned a lesson here. I think I used too thick bacon and it's too meaty and it's candied so it's just it's too hard. It's hard to chew through. So, I don't know if this is a good idea. I think it is. I'm going to load this up with this candied bacon in nice convenient more biteable pieces and retrieve the egg. All right, I'm going to push it down. And when it when I do get your ponchos on, you're in the splash zone. There we go. There's the breakfast sandwich, boys. There it is. The panmuff bre. It's I call it the George Moes. Just to piss him off. Let's take a look at that cross-section, shall we? Yep. Breakfast in a I was about to say in a bite and a lot of big heavy nasty bites. All right, let's try it out. Bullseye. That'sing delicious. I Okay, let's walk through it. The uh patties are nice and juicy, still very tender because, you know, they're they're mostly surface area. They're mostly crunch. The bacon works so much better now that it's not big chewy steaky pieces like it's nice little crunchy bits. So, getting thinner bacon next time so it's all crunchy throughout. That's going to be the key. The egg's perfect. It's an egg. It's a runny egg fried in butter. What else do you want? The maple mustard is inspired. I don't think it could have come from one mind. We needed to merge minds in order for it to happen. And I'm so glad we did because it's just the right amount of breakfast flavor that I was looking for. But we don't need the flavor of the maple to be coming from the bacon because it comes through in that sauce. And that sauce is the perfect mixture of sharp and puquant and sweet and breakfasty. It's like right there. I think I'm ready to go impress the Burger King. The real Burger King George. I hope he likes it. If not, I'm going to take it to Burger King. See what they think. [Music] A lot of pressure right now. A lot of people looking at me who do this for a living. 30 seconds. Okay. I've never deep fried bacon before. All right. So, this is what I present to you as a breakfast only burger. Oo. Okay. I wanted to make a burger that you'd only have in the morning. You said a burger is good at any time of day. True. This one's only good in the morning. So, we have a runny fried egg on top of two patties that have been lightly spiced with sage and cayenne smoked paprika, which is a sausage profile, some crispy fried bacon. I made a maple uh mustard mayo 3. So, you've got a little bit of uh the savory Dijon, and you've got the sweetness of the mint. Perfect. And I invented a new kind of bread. I call it the uh bun cake because it's halfway between a pancake and a uh English burger. Wow. Bacon first. Sage. Wait, is it a burger? It's still a burger. Still a burger. That is an accomplishment. That's a hamburger. Cheers. So, it's a breakfast burger. All right. You did it, man. Would you eat this at 5:00 p.m. Sober? Yeah, I would. Yeah, probably. Yeah. I failed. All right. Well, thank you so much for for trying it for me. Thank you for letting me cook behind the wine. My pleasure, bub. Thanks for sharing, Mike. You did a good job. Absolutely. You got to try it. Want to try it? Oh, that's perfectly good. Thanks again to Danish Crearyy for partnering with me on this series of leveled up brunch dishes.

qiGJm7RD1fs,"Hey, what's up guys? Welcome back to Basics with Babish, where this week we're doing burgers and fries. Do I really have to do like a whole sales pitch? Let's get down to [Music] basics. All right, guys. So, the first thing we need to do is start the French fry making process. This means peeling and slicing some potatoes. So, we're going to start by peeling the potatoes. Duh. And then slicing into planks and then into almost French fry-l like shapes. As thick or as thin as you like them. This is only going to change frying time. Then, we're immediately dropping these bad boys into some 375° Fahrenheit peanut oil. That is my deep frying oil of choice. If you have an allergy to peanuts, try canola or vegetable. You might be saying now, ""Hey, Babish, those fries aren't done."" To which I would respond, ""I know, and that's not my real name. And what we're doing is freezing the fries after par frying. This is going to crystallize their interiors and make them extra fluffy after a second fry. While those guys are freezing for at least 4 hours, it's time to address maybe one of the top two most important parts of burger and fries, the burger. I've got my preferred selection of meats here for grinding. I've got short rib, brisket, and sirloin. They're all bringing something different to the table, be it fattiness, minerality, or beefiness. And they're going to come together to make a really flavorful, fatty, beautiful burger. First thing we got to do is get rid of the bone in the short rib. If you have a bone in short rib, best to buy these boneless because you're going to get more meat and you have to do less butchery. Once you've removed the bone, trim off any silver skin that you see because this stuff will not break down and it'll be chewy bits in your burger and you don't want that. And then start cutting it into 1 in strips that we're going to then cut crosswise into about 1 to 2 in chunks, which will be perfect for our meat grinder. Then we're going to rinse and repeat with our other cuts of beef. On the brisket, this is nothing but fat. We can hang on to all this. As long as your knife cuts relatively easily through it, it's probably fine for your burger. Now, there is some silver skin hiding in the middle of our sirloin. So, we're going to pull it apart at the seam to reveal the dastardly little devil hiding inside. Once you've got all your senue and silver skin removed and all your meat broken down, it's time to place all this on a parchment line baking sheet and freeze for 15 to 20 minutes to firm up the meat for the meat grinder. During which time, we can get our burger accutra ready. Just going to very thinly slice some tomatoes. I like them about a quarter of the width of a sheet of paper and a few slices of red onion. And last but not least, some iceberg lettuce. This is the only kind of lettuce that belongs on a burger because it is nearly flavorless. We're going to simply shred it by cutting it in half, removing the core, and then cutting into thin slices down the length of the lettuce half and then cutting crosswise into perfect little burgeriz shreds. And that's what I like to top a burger with. Put whatever you want on there, but I reserve the right to judge you. Like, if you didn't put special sauce on there, I'd think that you were a real true weirdo. And special sauce is simple enough to make. Simply mix together equal parts ketchup and mayo, maybe 1/2 cup each. Add a good sprinkling of garlic powder and onion powder. Then I like to add a little bit of smoked paprika, but you could use regular paprika if you don't want too much of a smoky vibe going on. A heaping helping of sweet relish. And that's about it. Just mix the whole thing together. Even if you just mix together equal parts catchman mayo, it's a delicious sauce to put on a burger or to dip your fries in or to just eat with a spoon. That I will not judge you for, I promise. Give it a little taste. Make sure it's good. Of course it is. And then it's time to get down to the business of meat grinding. Now, I've had my grinder parts chilling in the freezer with the meat for a little bit longer, maybe 30 minutes to an hour to make sure everything's really super cold. This prevents the beef from smearing when we push it through the feed hole. That's what it is called. You can see that our beef is all firmed up after about 20 minutes in the freezer. And avoiding the spinning wheel of death on the bottom of our stand mixer, we're going to start feeding the beef into the grinder a few pieces at a time, pushing the beef down the tube with whatever included baseball bat or nightstick the grinder came with. And watch the meat cascade gleefully out the mediumsiz grind plate, which I think is the best size for ground beef for burgers. Make sure there's no gray stuff coming out, which might indicate that your grinder is grinding metal. Make sure no long stringy stuff is coming out. That could be senue or your beef might not be cold enough. and take a moment to appreciate the beautiful pebbly ground beef that you're able to achieve when you grind your own meat at home. This pebbliness is going to help us create a burger that is less closed textured than one made with store-bought ground beef, which is a little mushy and pasty. So, now we're going to start gently pressing these into 4 and 1/2 to 5 oz patties. I'm going for a solid third pounder burger, but make them as thick as you want. It's your house. Once we've got the burgers formed, they can chill out in the fridge while we finish up our fries. We've got the oil reheated to 375° F. And we've got our rock solid fries out the freezer and into the oil. The initial fry was for about 8 minutes. This is going to be from 4 to 6 minutes until we get beautifully browned exteriors and fluffy light interiors. As soon as you've let these guys drain for 30 seconds to 1 minute, we're going to put them immediately into a bowl and toss them with a healthy sprinkle of kosher salt. Go ahead and taste one to make sure that it's not poison. Maybe two just to be extra safe. And then these aren't the only things getting salted. Let's move over back to the patties. whom are receiving a generous sprinkling of kosher salt and freshly ground pepper. Do not ever salt your burgers before you form the patties. Please don't ever let me catch you doing this. Now, one of the most important things you guys know that I love to do and that you should do for every burger that you ever make is toast your buns in some butter. Please. I'm sorry I'm being so emphatic right now, but these things are important. Get a nice golden toast going on in there. Add some vegetable oil to your cast iron skillet and get that guy ripping hot before adding your beef patty. I'm just doing one for the sake of demonstration, but you can do up to four at a time. Let this sit over mediumigh heat for a solid 3 to 4 minutes until a beautiful crust has formed on one side. And you can see a little bit of cooked brownness creeping up the side of the patty. Once you flipped it, we're going to almost immediately hit it with some American cheese. Hate on American cheese all you like. It is the best cheese for burgers. Then we're going to add about a tablespoon of water and cover the burger, allowing the cheese to melt and helping the burger cook more evenly. I mean, come on, look at that. Use an instant read thermometer to determine if you've cooked your burger to your desired degree of dness. And it's time to plate up onto a waiting bed of lettuce. We're going to deposit our patty. Always best to put the lettuce underneath the burger as this helps prevent the lettuce from wilting. And then top with our tomato, onion, special sauce, the top of the bun, bottom of the bun if you want to be extra special. Top the whole thing up and serve along with your French fries. And there you have it. One very serious homemade burger and fries. Now it's time, of course, for the requisite cross-section. I'm going to show you three levels of acceptable dness. Let's start with medium. That's where you're taking the burger off the heat at about 135° Fahrenheit, letting it rest until it hits maybe 140. Then for slightly braver souls, there's rare, where we're taking it off at 120, letting it rest and reach 125. And then the sweet spot, medium rare, 125 to 130°. Tender, juicy, delicious. If you're freaking out about beef cooked below USDA recommended dness temperatures, you have much less to worry about if you're grinding your own beef at home. So, give it a shot. Whatever minor risks there are are outweighed by the importance of enjoying a really delicious burger. [Music] All right. So, whether we're making barbecue pork chops indoors or out, we want to start with a basic brine. This is going to be about a cup and a half of kosher salt or 3/4 of a cup of table salt to four quarts of water. Make sure you stir it a whole lot so it is very, very dissolved. Before adding your pork chops, I have two different kinds of pork chops here. Rib chops and loin chops. two different kinds of textures and flavors. Either way, we're going to cover them and refrigerate them for at least 1 hour and up to five. Once brined, it's time to start preparing for the cooking process. For the outdoor version of these pork chops, I've decided to enlist the help of one, Mr. Brad Leone, who's going to teach us a little bit about building a twozone fire. Want to put it on one side. We're going to add a little bit more reinforcement. What he's basically doing is building a super hot fire on one side of a charcoal grill. This is so we can cook our pork chops with both direct and indirect heat. You can accomplish the same thing on a gas grill by only turning half the burners on high. While that preheats, I'm going to prep our brine pork chops. Now, the best way to distribute heat onto these guys is to stand them up by the bones and pierce them twice with long wooden or metal skewers, standing them up vertically on their bones. These are bone in pork chops, after all. We're also going to employ a little trick to prevent the classic curling pork chop. We're going to place two small slices along the fat cap of each pork chop. Being sure to cut through the layer of senue. This is going to prevent that senue from contracting and making your pork chop curl. Now, onto the cool side of the fire. That is the side of the fire that is not on fire. We're going to place the chops bone side down, making sure there's a little bit of space between each of them so the heat can circulate evenly. And we're also going to insert a temperature probe to monitor when these guys get around 115° F. Boom. Smokey. Once they hit that temperature, that is when we're going to remove the skewers and place them horizontally onto the hot side of the fire where we're going to start building up a shellacted, as Brad likes to call it, barbecue crust by brushing layer after layer of barbecue sauce onto the pork, flipping continually until they reach an internal temperature of 145° F. The sugars in the barbecue sauce should caramelize and you should start seeing a beautiful exterior like these. Once they hit their target temperature, it's time to remove them from the fire situation and place them on a baking sheet for a 3minut rest to let the juices redistribute and let the meat relax a little bit. Situate them on a nice carving board like this one. We're going to hit them with one last luxurious layer of barbecue sauce before cutting them open and taking a look at the beautiful pink interior. Not stark white and dry, but lightly pink and juicy. You might even see a light smoke ring if you really did your job right. Oh, wait a second. I'm just going to put one last finishing touch on this bite. Oh yeah. Now, let's hear what Brad has to say about cooking pork properly. Here's what biggest thing, biggest misunderstanding about pork is people hammer the hell out of it. They overcook it. Cook it to 150, 160, 175, tinosis. Those days are over, man. Okay, rant's over. Now it's time to try to get those barbecue flavors indoors. Let's start by building a sort of pseudo dry rub. This method comes courtesy of America's Test Kitchen. We're going to combine 1 tbsp of dark brown sugar with a solid teaspoon of paprika, a/ teaspoon of smoked paprika for extra smoky goodness, a/ teaspoon of ground coriander, and one whole teaspoon of ground cumin. Oh, and don't forget several healthy twists of freshly ground pepper. No need to add salt. That was taken care of in the brining process. Speaking of which, let's get our chops out of that salt water. We want to pat them super duper dry because the drier these guys get, the better crust we're going to be able to create. So, spare no paper towels as you endeavor to try to make these chops as dry as the day they were born. Once they're nice and dry, it's time to hit them with our spice rub. Make sure they are generously coated on all sides. That includes the fat cap and bone. We're trying to infuse a ton of barbecue flavor in here, and we're not going to accomplish that by skimping. Now, let's set those aside while we build a rudimentary barbecue sauce. Let's start with half a cup of plain jane ketchup along with half of one small onion finely grated. A few solid hits, maybe 1 to 2 tablespoons of warchester shear sauce. Is that how you say it? That cannot possibly be right. Half a teaspoon of smoked paprika, a little bit more smoky flavor. Two full tablespoons of Dijon mustard. This is going to bring a great mustard flavor to the barbecue sauce. And another tablespoon or two of dark brown sugar. Whisk the whole thing together. And this is practically tasty enough as it is, but I like to simmer it for at least 30 minutes before applying it to our chops. Speaking of which, let's heat up two tablespoons of vegetable oil over mediumigh heat in a non-stick pan to which we are going to introduce our dry rubbed pork chops. I'm going to do two at a time. You can do up to four. Just make sure they're not overlapping or are too close together, otherwise you won't start to form this nice brown crust. Oh, whoops. I forgot to put those nice little cuts in the side of our chops. Better late than never. I'm also going to insert our temperature probe into the side so we can pull these guys at about 130° F or right now. We're going to take these off the heat, set them aside, and wipe out our pan in preparation for the indoor version of shellacking. We're going to start by again heating a tablespoon or two of oil in our pan over mediumigh heat and then brushing our chops down with a layer of our barbecue sauce. We're then going to place these sauce side down into the preheated pan, brushing down the exposed side with more sauce before flipping, saucing, repeating until we have that similar barbecue crust and our chops have registered 145° Fahrenheit internally. Going to set them aside, let them rest, and then serve them with a little bit of extra barbecue sauce and a smile. Now, are these a dead ringer for genuine outdoor smoky barbecue? No. But they're really, really, really good and probably the best pork chops that you could make out of your home kitchen. Especially if you cook them to the proper temperature of 145° Fahrenheit internally. Watch them join not only the clean plate club, but the clean bone club. Sorry, I'm going to chill out with with the clubs. That's just how you know it's really, really good. [Music] All right, guys. So, let's start the day with some grilled beef and vegetable kebabs. So, we're going to start by making a lemon rosemary marinade. This recipe comes courtesy of America's Test Kitchen. We're going to start by roughly chopping up a medium onion, 2 tablespoons of chopped fresh rosemary, then peeling and roughly chopping six medium garlic cloves. Just chop them up a little bit. We're going to put everything in a food processor. I'm also going to grate the zest from one lemon and add the juice from the lemon. Now, we're going to add 1/3 of a cup of beef broth, plus 1/3 of a cup of vegetable oil, a few hefty pinches of kosher salt, a much less hefty pinch of white sugar, and many, many twists of freshly ground black pepper. Then, three heaping squeezes of tomato paste or about 3 tablespoons. We're now going to process this for about a minute until completely smooth. And there you go, marinade. Now, it's time to get our beef and vegetables ready. We're going to start with either chuck or sirloin tips that we're going to cut into relatively uniform sizes. We want them to be about 2 in by 2 in. The more uniform the better so they cook evenly. As for the vegetables, we're going to break them down into again relatively evenly sized pieces. I'm going to have this zucchini lengthwise and then cut it into 1in segments. Now, there's a lot of tips and tricks about how to core your pepper, but really the key is to cut the head off and rip its heart out. And then we're just going to cut the peppers into 1 to 1 and 1/2 in pieces. Lastly, we've got a large red onion that we're going to cut in half. Take out the core. Cut into wedges and then cut each of those wedges into three or four pieces. So, we've got nice 1-in wide chunks of red onion. And now it's time to marinate both the beef and the vegetables. We're going to add most of the marinade, maybe about 3/4 of it, to the beef. Mix it up good. Make sure that every piece is covered in marinade. And we're going to add the remaining mixture, probably about a half a cup's worth, to the vegetables. Give them a good toss. Cover both. Let the beef marinate for 1 hour in the fridge and the vegetables marinate for 1 hour at room temperature. 1 hour later and it's time to skewer. You probably know how to do this. I don't think I need to instruct you, but all you really need to do is skewer the meat and press it tightly against one another. Make sure you don't ow ow get your finger. And with the vegetables, just alternate between each type of vegetable so you get a nice pleasing pattern going. Most people put both the meat and the vegetables on the same skewer. This doesn't work. Why not put meat on one skewer and vegetables on another? This way they can cook at their own desired rates. All right, we're going to bring our skewers over to the grill, open her up, and uh h how do I do this? My god, who Hi, I'm Shannon, your local ACE associate, and I'm here to help you get started with your grill. This particular grill is a Weber Genesis E310 propane grill. All you need to do is turn the knobs in front of you to the light position, hit the igniter button, and it'll start right up. Also, you'll see with the three different knobs here, you can heat sections of the grill to different temperatures for different foods. That's perfect because I need to cook the steak over high heat and the vegetables over medium. Oh my god. Whoa. Nashville truly is a magical place. So, first we're going to let this grill preheat over high heat for 15 minutes. Lid closed. Get it hot. Now that our grill is preheated, I'm going to turn the left two burners down to medium and keep the right burner on hot. And we're going to put the steak on the right side of the grill and the vegetables on the left. Then we're going to close the lid and let these cook for 6 minutes before flipping for the first time. Then we're going to close it back up. Cook for an additional 6 minutes for 12 minutes total before we check our meat's temperature. I want to hit about 125. I'm also going to take one of these kebabs off first and leave the other ones on for another couple minutes for anybody who wants them a little bit more well done, aka people who are wrong. And as for the vegetables, we're going to leave those on for an additional 5 to 6 minutes until they've got a really good char on them and they're nice and soft. All right, so let's get all these skewers out onto a tray. Nice. And there you go. Perfect kebabs. Easy, fast, delicious. All right, so next up, we're going to make a grilled pork tenderloin. Again, courtesy of America's Test Kitchen, we're making a piko pepper and menchego stuffed pork tenderloin. Let's start by making our stuffing. Now, making the stuffing is very simple. We just need to throw the following items into a food processor. Two garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped. One slice of hearty white bread. In this case, we didn't have any white bread, so a hot dog bun will do just fine. A whole jar of piko peppers patted dry. 2 oz of manchego cheese chopped up. 1/4 cup of toasted pine nuts. A teaspoon of minced fresh thyme. And a good sprinkle of smoked paprika. Go ahead and pulse that four 5 6 7 8 nine times until a rough paste is formed. At this point, we're going to season with salt and pepper. Process a few more times until we've got a nice chunky stuffing. And now it's time to butterfly and stuff our pork tenderloins. So to butterfly our pork tenderloin is very easy. We're just going to place some cuts lengthwise along the side of the pork tenderloin until we've almost hit the other side and open it up like a book. Then we're going to cover both tenderloins in plastic wrap and we're just going to pound one out. We want to pound them out to about a/2 in thickness and so they're nice even rectangles as best we can. Then once they're pounded out, we're going to season them before stuffing them. Nice hefty sprinkles of kosher salt. Many good twists of freshly ground black pepper. And about four teaspoons of dark brown sugar that we're going to rub in the meat. Make sure it's equally distributed. Now it's time to stuff with both our cheese and bread stuffing and some baby spinach. We're going to start by spreading half of the stuffing on each of the pork tenderloins on one end of the long side of the roast and topping that with some baby spinach. And then we're going to roll the whole darn thing up. And as is the case with doing a recipe for the first time, always have two so you can mess one up and then do the second one correctly. Both of these we're going to tie closed with butcher's twine. Again, we're going to do a terrible job on the first one and then a much better job on the second one. You don't really need to do the full truss. You can just tie it off using a simple square knot every inch and a half to 2 in or so to make sure the whole thing stays closed. And then trim the excess string to make sure that it's not hanging off and burning. And there you go. All right, so these guys are ready for the grill. Let's take them over to the gas grill. And Oh, Jesus. Hey, Andrew, since you're going to be temping these tenderloins, why don't you use the iigril 3. Even though you scare the life out of me, you're awfully helpful. Why, thank you. The iigirl 3 lets you monitor the temperature of your food through the iigril app on your mobile device. It's super easy to set up. All you have to do is pair it with your device via Bluetooth, plug the probes into the thermometer, and insert them into your food. Set your desired temperature in the app, and it will notify you when your food is ready. So, this is perfect. So I can monitor the temperature of these roasts off. Holy. Okay, now that Shannon has disappeared once again into the unknown, it's time to get these tenderloins grilling. We need to make sure that the stuffing of these roasts hits 165° because it is in contact with raw meat. This time we're going to use what's called an indirect heat source, meaning we're going to turn the right burner all the way to maximum and the left two burners all the way to low and placed the roasts over the left side of the grill. So once we close the lid, they're getting heated almost like in an oven, but they're also getting grill marks. We're going to flip them about halfway through cooking, which should be about 30 minutes or as soon as they register 165° F internally, which we'll monitor on our phones because this is 2018. These guys are fresh off the grill. So, let's slice these babies up. And there you have it. Two pork tenderloins. One is beautiful on the outside, but both are beautiful on the inside, just like all of you. So, now we've got some beautiful sausages and chicken wings. I feel like infusing some woodfired flavors. So, let's take them over to the woodfired grill. This thing looks pretty easy. Let's just uh crank it on with Whoa. What the What is this? Don't do that. Is this Shannon? Is she about to appear behind me? Oh my god, Shannon, you are haunting me with helpfulness. You're welcome, Andrew. I want to make sure you set up your Trager Pro 22 correctly. On first use, you need to run the woodfire grill on high for 45 minutes to make sure you burn off all the oils that protect it from the elements while it's shipped your way. Grilling with a Trager woodfire grill is easier than you think. Since it uses convection cooking instead of direct heat, it's similar to cooking in an oven, but provides a delicious smoky flavor. You can grill, smoke, roast, bake, braze, and barbecue all on the same grill. It's pretty awesome. To get cooking, you just fill the hopper with pellets, turn it on, and select the setting you need. It's so easy to use. Also included with the Trager are these digital probes that fit through the side of the unit so you can monitor the temperature of your food without having to open it and lose the beautiful smoke and heat building inside. Oh, cool. I can use these to monitor the temperature of my sausage. I'm going Oh my god. Okay, just remember Andy, it's all cheap special effects. All right, so I'm going to arrange the chicken wings on the bottom half of the smoker and the sausage on the top rack. I'm going to close it up and let the sausages go until they reach an internal temp of 165 F. For the chicken, I'm going to leave them on for 30 minutes, flipping once. Right at the end, I'm going to slather them with barbecue sauce and crank the heat up to high to get a nice barbecue crust. And there you have it. Some simple chicken wings and sausages elevated to a new level with the help of [Music] smoke. All right. So, folks, this is not your typical episode of Basics with Babish. This is Backyard with Babish, where today we're going to be exploring how to smoke on a gas grill. Barbecue purists will tell you that's punishable by law. But at the end of the day, if you give them a rack of smoky, flavorful, juicy ribs and they're still complaining, just don't invite them over next time. Now, you can smoke all kinds of stuff using this method, but as an example, we're going to go with ribs. And for ribs and most other barbecue, we need a spice rub. So, my favorite baseline spice rub starts with about a/2 cup of sweet paprika, maybe about a tablespoon of smoked paprika if you want to juke the smoke stats, but hopefully we won't need that. About a/2 cup of dark brown sugar, maybe 2 or 3 tablespoons of chili powder, and a hefty sprinkling or about a tablespoon each of ground ginger, garlic powder, and onion powder. And then we start getting into the optional stuff. How about a teaspoon or two of ground sage? This along with a teaspoon or two of dried oregano can bring some nice herbiness to the party. How about a teaspoon of ground mustard seed is going to bring a little tang, a little acidity. And a/ teaspoon, maybe a full teaspoon of ground cayenne if you want a little heat. Decidedly not optional, is a solid tablespoon of ground pepper, preferably freshly ground, but forgive me. And a tablespoon of kosher. Oh, that's way too much. Let's just shake out about a tablespoon of that and then try to get the rest back into the box here. I don't want to spill any salt. That's bad luck. That's not working. Excuse me while I go inside and very carefully drop this into a bowl. And there you have it. All the building blocks of a very basic Memphis dry rub. A dry rub is not only necessary to build flavor, but over time to develop the prized bark that develops on the outside of smoked meat. Once it's all mixed together and homogeneous, now's the time to give it a taste in the most efficient way possible by throwing it upwards in the air and catching it with your tongue and adjusting as necessary. What does it need? How's the balance between sweet and salty and savory? Rubs, sauces, and smokers alike are all subjects of heated contention. So, there's no exact formula here. This is an opportunity to build flavors and develop your own style. Once you've got your rub in a place where you like it, it's time to make good on its name and give it a rub down on some ribs, specifically of the baby back variety. These are some of the quicker cooking and more forgiving ribs that you can find. But, we can't just rub them down and call it a day. First, we have to remove a papery membrane from underneath the ribs. This is best done by finding the edge of the membrane using a pairing knife and then using a paper towel to grip, peeling it off in one smooth, unusually satisfying motion. Be sure not to skip this step. This membrane prevents fat from rendering out of the ribs. And no matter how long you cook it for, it will remain chewy and inedible. So, once that's removed, your racks are ready to rock. But before they head over to the heat, we need to rub them down with our rub. Set aside about a half a cup of your rub for later use. And sprinkle the rest generously all over every square inch of your ribs. Just sort of pat it down and spread it out as you go to make sure that it's absorbing the little bit of moisture on the outside of your ribs. And make sure that no single solitary square inch goes uncovered top, bottom, and sides. Right now is quite simply not the time to be bashful about rubbing. Once every facet of your racks have been stained in an even coat of crimson, we're going to let these guys sit out at room temperature for about an hour. This is going to help a sort of crust form on the outside of your ribs, which will make for a stronger bark later on. So, while these guys sit out, we can discuss how we're going to convert our gas grill into a smoker. Now, gas grills are a far cry from an ideal smoking setup. There's no wood for starters, but it's also full of vents through which smoke can escape. And the burning of propane creates a very dry cooking environment. So, we're going to offset those a couple different ways. First up, the lack of wood. We're going to cut ourselves a length of aluminum foil and on one side, pile a few handfuls of small wood chips for smoking. You can go with anything from apple to pecan to cherry to mosquite. I'm going with hickory. We're then going to fold that foil onto itself and crimp the edges to make a little foil packet of wood chips. And if you like, you can make three or four of these ahead of time cuz you're probably going to go through one every hour and a half or so. Once that's all crimped into a pretty little package, we're going to cut four or five vents into the top so smoke can escape. This guy is then headed directly on top of the heat plates that sit right above your actual burners. We want it as close to the heat source as possible so the wood begins to smolder and you guessed it, smoke. You'll also notice that we're placing it on the far right side of the grill. This is so we can have all of our heat localized on the right side of the grill and place our ribs on the left side of the grill, creating a barbecue essential known as indirect heat. Next up, we're going to compensate for the very dry cooking environment furnished by a propane grill by placing a couple disposable aluminum pans right over the wood chips and filling them halfway with good old-fashioned tap water. Now, you could use apple juice or beer, but either way, these guys are going to simmer and introduce some muchneeded steam into the situation. Now, we're going to crank our rightmost burners over high heat. Remove this kind of bun warmer rack. We've already got smoking hot buns. Sorry. Close this guy up and wait for your improvised smoker to start well smoking. Now, we don't want the wood chips to burn too hot or too fast. So, once they start smoking like this, we're going to turn the heat down to medium in an effort to both slow combustion and maintain a grill temperature between 225 and 275° F. Once the smoke production sort of slows down a little bit and ideally turns from white to blue, it's time to introduce our ribs to the situation. For this, you can optionally use a rib rack. This is going to help the ribs cook a little bit more evenly. So, I'm just going to slice these guys in half and dab the cut end and rub to make sure that we're totally covered and start to stand the ribs up vertically on the left side",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
of the grill away from the heat. In fact, we want the ribs as far away from the heat as possible without touching the wall of the grill. Also, we want the ribs oriented like this, perpendicular to the heat, so they're getting even exposure. Then we're going to close the lid. And from this point on, make every effort to open it as seldomly as possible, making slight adjustments to the burner as necessary to maintain that temperature of 225 to 275. Now, ideally, you want to use an ambient temperature probe for this, not the built-in gauge on the grill. But if you got to use the gauge, it's not the end of the world. It's just not going to give you as good results. So, just peek out the window every 15 20 minutes, make sure that the temperature hasn't ventured too far outside that range, and make minor adjustments as necessary. Now, after an hour, you're going to notice that you're not producing nearly as much smoke. The first thing we're going to do to remedy that is simply rotate the wood packet, so it gets a little bit more varied exposure to the heat. This is probably going to buy you an extra half hour of smoke tops. But eventually, your fuel is going to run out and you're going to have to feed the beast. So, simply get that smoking hot bag of wood chips out of the way and drop in a fresh one. You did make those ahead of time, didn't you? You didn't. Well, they take like 10 seconds to make, so no big deal. Once the package is replaced, the smoke initiation procedure is very much the same. Crank these guys over high heat for about 5 6 minutes until thick white smoke begins to billow out of your grill. Now, more smoke does not necessarily equal better. So, for both the ribs flavor and tenderness, we need to exercise temperature control. If you're seeing tons of thick white smoke like this, your fire is too hot. Turn down the flame. Once you see this, the thin sacred blue smoke, that's when you've hit the sweet spot. Now, all there is left to do is maintain this smoke and the ambient temperature for anywhere from four to 6 hours, replacing your wood packet three or four times, depending on how much smoke flavor you want to get. There is no possible way to prescribe a cook time for anything when you're smoking. It's going to depend entirely on what you're smoking, what kind of meat it is, how thick it is, how much connective tissue there is, how hot your grill is, how well you've maintained the temperature. a million in one mitigating factors all dancing together in a delicate ballet known as barbecue. Just try to maintain the environment as best you can. Refill the water pans as necessary and turn your ribs 180° every 90 minutes or so to make sure that they're getting even exposure to the heat. Throughout this process, we've got plenty of time to make a barbecue sauce. Another hotly contested and wildly regionalized aspect of barbecue. The sweet, sour, and sticky substance that most of us are accustomed to is Kansas City style barbecue sauce. This starts with a small 14oz bottle of ketchup. And here we go. I'm going to try to say it correctly. 1/4 cup of woristersher sauce. Did I do it right? I had to Google how to say it first. One or two tablespoons of classic ballpark yellow mustard. A little squeeze or a few dashes of your favorite hot sauce. And you could use garlic powder and onion powder, but I like to grate two small cloves of garlic and about a/4 of a red onion directly into the sauce for a little extra texture and flavor. And then we got to balance out all this sour and savory with some sweet, usually taking the form of about half a cup of dark brown sugar. Hi. Hi. Go ahead and say hello for the first time to your new neighbors. Add the brown sugar as well as a few generous dashes of your barbecue rub. Regular size whisk all these guys together. And then just like the barbecue rub, give it a taste. What does it need? Is it too sour? Is it too sweet? Mine is a little bit too sour, so I'm going to offset that with some blackstrap molasses. Also, I want some more warmth and spice from my barbecue rub. So, I'm going to toss a little bit more of that in there. Once it is perfectly balanced, as all things should be, it's time to cover it and let it simmer over medium low heat for about 10 minutes to let all those flavors get to know each other. Meanwhile, excuse me. Meanwhile, my ribs are at about the 5hour mark. And they're looking pretty pretty good. We want them to hit about 200° Fahrenheit at their thickest point. And when stretched, we want the meat to slightly separate and the bones to feel a little loosey goosey. That means that these guys are ready to finish. So, I'm going to remove them from the rack and place them directly on the grill grate, still on the cool side of the grill. Then, I'm going to hit them with a generous shellac of our homemade barbecue sauce. We want this to form the ultra sticky caramelized layer that forms on the outside of ribs. To make this happen, we got to close up the grill and crank those far burners as high as they'll go until the ambient temperature of the grill reaches about 450° F. This is going to give our barbecue that stick to your ribs and your fingers and your teeth kind of extra credit. Once that layer is soft and sticky, but not fully hardened, it's time to take these guys off the grill. Let them rest for about 10 minutes. Give them one last brush down with sauce. And there you have it. some almost fully legit barbecue off a gas grill. I'm sure I'm going to catch hell for saying that, but if all you got is a gas grill in your backyard, this is the closest you can get to the real thing. You can even see that we've achieved a light pink smoke ring around the outside perimeter of the meat. And when subjected to the squeeze it so all the juices come out test, they pass with flying colors because these ribs receive the slow and low treatment they so dearly desire. And now I get to receive the ribs I so dearly desire. I hope you guys give this one a try for yourselves. It's a lot less intimidating and you're in a lot more control than you might [Music] imagine. Whoa, hold up. I thought that this was an episode about grilling. What pray is Babby doing with this peeled and sliced pineapple? Well, I'm going to grill it. Recently, I've been making this grilled shrimp, pineapple, and pablano pepper, sort of ceviche. And it's perfect for one of the two make ahead elements of our grilled feast. We're just going to hit them with a little bit of vegetable oil, and they're ready to go. We're also going to char the pablano peppers on the grill. So, we're just going to chop off their tops, dig out their seedy hearts, and slice them in half lengthwise. And with that, we're headed out to our first of two trips to the grill, which, if you're anything like me, looks something like this. Grates caked with the thousand ghosts of meals past. So, now's the perfect time to preheat it for 15 minutes on full blast. And once it clocks around 600° F, give it a thorough brushing. This not only prevents a whole bunch of old food getting stuck to your new food, it helps prevent food from getting stuck. Once everything is good and brushed, we're going to plop down our pineapple. Plus, we're going to plunk down our pablano peppers, but leave a little space because we're also going to grill our shrimp. The shrimp that I'm playing with today is called easy peel. Shrimp that's been de vained, but still has an easily removable shell. This is going to help protect the delicate meat of the shrimp and prevent them from becoming stringy or tough. You can definitely use peeled shrimp. Just be sure to take them off the very second that they're done cooking so they don't overcook. I usually shoot for about 120° Fahrenheit at its thickest point. Once the shrimp are up to temp, we're going to take them off the grill and plunge them directly into an ice bath. This is going to halt their cooking and get them nice and chilly for the ceviche. Next up are the pablano peppers that we've left skin side down. And we're going to pull them off the grill and wrap them in aluminum foil as soon as they've developed a completely charred exterior. That's going to soften up the peppers and make them easier to peel. Last up, the pineapple we're taking off once it's developed some nice grill marks. Last thing to do is assemble our sort of ceviche. We're going to start by peeling our shrimp and removing their tails if they still have the shells on. And then depending on the size of your shrimp, you might want to cut them down into bite-sized pieces. Next up, our grilled and cooled pineapple, which for each slice, we're going to cut in half, remove its tough, fibrous core, and likewise cut into bite-sized pieces similar to the size of the shrimp. Last but not least, we got our pablanos, which we're going to remove from the foil and start to peel off their carbonized exteriors. Not only would it be pretty bitter and acid, but it also probably isn't very good for you. Chop it up, add to the mix. Then, optionally, you can add a little bit of chopped mango. I find that this adds a lovely mango flavor to the thing. Then, we're dressing this with the juice of two limes. Then, depending on how spicy your pablanos are, you could add some thinly sliced jalapeno if you want a little bit more heat. And for a little bit of crunch and a lot of bit of flavor, some sliced scallions. Toss that together with some freshly ground pepper, some kosher salt, maybe a little splash of olive oil. And another flavor that plays really nice in this party is a little bit of ground cumin, like 1/4 teaspoons worth. Toss this guy together. Give them a taste to test for seasoning. Add salt, pepper, or cumin as necessary. And then you can cover them up and keep them in the fridge until you're ready to eat them. Next up on the pre-production side of our grilled feast is a potato salad. I got about four pounds of baby Yukons here, which I'm just going to cut in half, but you could use any waxy potato and cut it into bite-sized pieces. Then I'm going to add the potato slices to a pot full of water, which first I'm going to heavily salt and add a splash of vinegar. This is not only going to add some flavor, it's going to help the potatoes retain their shape throughout cooking. Once we got them all sliced and diced, we're going to place the pot on a stove and heat it using fire. Get it up to a boil, keep it there for like, I don't know,10, 12 minutes. And once the potatoes are tender throughout, evacuate them onto a rimmed baking sheet where they can cool completely. Now, you might be asking yourself, what kind of potato salad are we making here, Babish? And the answer is an elote potato salad. So, I got three ears of sweet corn here that I'm going to toss with a little bit of oil before placing on our preheated grill where we're going to blast it over high heat for 10 15 minutes depending on your grill. We just want a solid amount of char and for the corn to be fully cooked. This is all a great opportunity to get to know your grill before we bust out the burgers. Shuffle stuff around and find out where all of its hot and cold spots are. Once the corn is nicely charred, we're going to let it cool completely and build our dressing. 1/2 cup each sour cream and mayonnaise. An optional/ teaspoon of cayenne pepper if you want a little bit of heat. The freshly squeezed juice of one lime, a teaspoon each kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. You might need to adjust as necessary. Tiny whisk that together until nice and smooth. And then it's time to start adding our solids. I'm going to add half a large chopped red onion. Not typically part of a lot, but it's going to be real nice here. The charred kernels of our grilled corn that we're going to slice off the cob. Add those guys to the party. And then we're going to add some chopped cilantro or chopped parsley if you're like me and you don't like cilantro. Add our cooked and cooled ters. And then we just got one more piece of our tater salad puzzle. Some crumbled kotia cheese. About a/2 cups worth. This stuff can be kind of hard to find sometimes, so if you can't find it, feta is an acceptable substitute. Mix this guy together until thoroughly mixed. Taste for seasoning. Adjust per your preferences. And this guy's ready to be covered in plastic wrap and frriged until ready to consume. Now we can start with the alammen stuff. Burgers. I want consistently sized burgers. So I'm going to carefully measure out third pound mounds of ground round. I'm just kidding. It's ground chuck. Specifically 85% lean ground chuck, which I'm going to press into patties that sort of have a bowl shape to them. Burgers contract when they cook, which is why you sometimes end up with burgers that more closely resemble meatballs. This concave shape helps compensate for that so you end up with a burger with the proper proportions. Now we're headed out to our preheated grill where we're going to generously season our burgers with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper right before putting them on the grill. Do not be mixing salt, pepper, any other seasonings, onions, peppers, whatever into your burgers. They will positively your burgers texture. Gently pat the seasonings onto the surface and then we're going to lay these down on the hottest part of the grill that you can find. The objective here is to sear the hell out of these burgers for a couple minutes and then let them finish cooking in a cooler part of the grill. We're also going to toss our hot dogs over there and toast our buns on the aforementioned cooler side of the grill. One big concern with burgers is flare-ups. Little ones like this are totally normal, but you can expect a pretty big fireworks display when you flip it over. If however during cooking you find that your burger is engulfed in flames like this, you're going to want to relocate it. That just means that there's too much fat that's fallen down into the grill. And while it looks cool, it's going to impregnate your burger with acurid, burnt tasting flavors. The hot dogs are just kind of hot dogs. You grill hot dogs until they're done and then you eat them. Now, for the burgers, we're going to do something special. We're going to top them with pimento cheese. Once we've placed them over on the cooler side of the grill where the cheese can melt and the burgers can finish cooking. Close the lid as necessary. On a gas grill, you're closing it to make it hotter. On a charcoal grill, you're closing it to smother the fire and make it colder. Get the burgers cooked to your degree of dness, and then it's time to assemble. A July 4th favorite at my house parties has been a Reuben style hot dog. Couple slices of pastrami hot dog, a big pile of sauerkraut, and a squirt of Russian dressing. If you ask me, hot dogs need no improvement, but this sure works. The pimento cheeseburgers were dressing up simply with the usual burger autram. Not so much lettuce. What is this, a salad? LTO, ketchup, mustard. Top it up and we're ready to present a grilled feast to celebrate. Fireworks, family, and food. So now to take this meal to the next level, alls we need is a great cocktail. Since all the wild botanicals in the botist play really nice with savory flavors, I'm feeling like a twist on the classic Bloody Mary that we're going to call the Red Snapper. I have here 2 ounces of the Botist Isa dry gin, which I'm going to combine in a cocktail shaker with 4 oz of the very finest tomato juice. A half ouncez of the very finest freshlysqueezed lemon juice. Precisely four dashes of your favorite hot sauce. One, two, three, four, precisely four dashes of your favorite were Chester Shshire sauce. And about one bar spoons worth of horseradish. This here is a bar spoon, which uh we're going to use to uh measure out a bar spoon's worth of horseradish. Plop. In she goes. Plus, I'm going to add a little pinch of celery salt and a little pinch of freshly ground black pepper. Now, we're going to do something called rolling the cocktail. That is, we're going to mix it without shaking or stirring it. We're going to put a few cubes of ice in a separate smaller cocktail shaker and hold them in place using a strainer. See, it's simple physics. Then to roll it, we're going to simply pour the cocktail back and forth between the two shakers. This mixes the cocktail without any bubbles or froth and with minimal dilution. Just pour it back and forth, I don't know, five, six times until it's well chilled and ready to strain over rocks in a Collins glass. Garnish with all your favorite garnishes. I'm going with the classic lemon, celery, and pickleare. And there you have it, the perfect savory cocktail to go with all this savory stuff. It's even a patriotic red color, perfect for the Fourth of July. While the vodka and a Bloody Mary can easily slip into the background, this red snapper has a notable depth of flavor coming from the botist Jyn's variety of botanicals. [Music] All right, first basics in a long, long time. And this one's basic indeed. A barbecue chicken with no recipe. You can use any chicken parts that you like, but make sure that they're bone in and skin on. If you got a whole bird, you can break it down into its core components using little more than a pair of kitchen shears. First, snipping out the spine and cracking things open. Cutting easily between the breast and the thigh where there's virtually no bone or connective tissue. Trying to leave more skin on the breast than on the thigh. Then to separate the breasts, we're placing a shallow snip at the base of the breast plate, cracking it open and pulling out the dark red keelbone, making it much easier to simply cut directly between the breasts, separating the two halves of the bird. Then you can leave the wings attached to the breasts for airline style. Or just like when you separate the thighs and the drums, you follow a thin strip of fat that runs around the joint and place exploratory cuts until you can fit the scissors between the bones. Once the chicken's chopped up, it's time to rub it down with spices. To eyeball a barbecue dry rub, we start with mostly chili powder. Let's say about a third of a cup of the stuff. Chili powder and sweet paprika are very neutral, rounded, familiar barbecue flavors, so they make up most of the dust. Then, if you're not using a smoker, I like to add a teaspoon of smoked paprika for, you know, smoke. And about a/ teaspoon or all that I have left of cayenne pepper for a little bit of heat. Then a/ teaspoon of cumin brings some floral funky notes. A/ teaspoon of oregano for grassy herbaceiousness. and about a teaspoon each garlic powder and onion powder. Both of which obviously bring essential foundational flavor. Then I like to add about a half teaspoon of crushed dried rosemary. Normally I'm not a fan, but in barbecue spice rubs, they bring a really familiar comforting flavor. And then damn near as much brown sugar as there are spices. Dry rubs and barbecue sauce are both laden with sugar. These sugars caramelize on the grill and balance out all the tang and spice, so it's pretty hard to overdo it. A few twists of freshly ground black pepper and a few generous pinches of kosher salt. Make sure you taste your spice rub. We want it to taste almost equal parts sweet, spicy, and salty. Once you got the flavors where you like them, it's time to spread your dust evenly across every facet of your chicken, top, bottom, and sides, rubbing it into and under the skin wherever possible. Cover this guy up with plastic wrap and let him sit in the fridge for at least a couple hours, ideally overnight. In the meantime, we can focus on our sauce. Barbecue sauce is also pretty easy to eyeball. It's usually around 60% ketchup, maybe 20% yellow mustard, and the rest is just flavors and sweeteners. A few dashes of hot sauce, any leftover barbecue rub, a pinch of garlic powder, pinch of onion powder, a generous dash of Rochester sauce, fresh ground pepper, pinch of kosher salt, and a big old gug of the sweetener of your choice. Molasses, honey, brown sugar, maple syrup, and then you can taste it for flavor and adjust. Just like the dry rub, it should be sweet, tangy, salty, and spicy. Bring this guy up to a simmer and cook for about 10 minutes before putting to good use. Now, we're headed out to the grill where my grill grates really need to be seasoned. So, I'm maxing out my burners and getting this whole thing ripping hot for about 15 minutes before giving the grates a thorough scraping with a wire brush. Then turning off the heat and generously lubing the grates with a neutral flavored oil like vegetable or canola. Crank the heat back on to max and let the oil cure on the grates for about 10 minutes. Now, by definition, barbecue is not barbecue without smoke. And the best way to do that on a gas grill is to make a smoke packet. Placing wood chips or smoker pellets on a sheet of aluminum foil, wrapping them up tight into a wide flat packet, and poking some holes in the top for smoke to escape. All of our pieces are in place. So now it's time to grab our chicken. As you can see, our dry rub has formed a beautiful layer on the outside of the chicken, which is not only going to taste awesome, it's also going to get sticky and crunchy when we sear things off towards the end. Now, we want to try to maintain a constant temperature, but the temperature gauges built into grills are notoriously unreliable. You can usually count on the temperature at the grates being about 100 degrees Fahrenheit hotter than whatever the gauge says. Since I want to smoke my chicken around 225, 325 is right where I want to live on the gauge. To achieve that temperature, I've got all the burners on the left side of the grill turned off. Only the far right burner is turned on. So, the chicken is all going on the cool side of the grill. The dark meat is closer to the heat source because it's less prone to overcooking. Then, I'm lifting up the grates over the active burner and placing our wood chip packet directly onto the heat shield over the burner. Depending on how hot your grill runs, you might just be able to put it right on top of the grates. But mine's pretty weak, so the packet needs that more direct heat exposure. So, all the heat and smoke are being generated on this side of the grill and creating a gentle ambient cooking environment for the chicken on this side of the grill. So, now comes the hard part. Shutting this guy down, trying to maintain that temperature and resisting the urge to peak. If you find that the temperature is getting too low, crank up the burner on the right side. And vice versa if things are getting too hot. From this point on, there's only two reasons we open this grill. one to occasionally spray down the chicken with apple juice. Not only is this going to create a nice moist cooking environment and add a nice flavor, but moisture helps meat absorb smoke. So, especially given that this is hackyard barbecue, we want to maximize as much smoke flavor as we can. The other reason is to replace the smoke packet every 30 to 45 minutes once you stop seeing and smelling the good stuff wafting up from inside. The chicken usually smokes for about an hour and a half, so making three packets ahead of time is a safe bet. Once the chicken is starting to look dry and tight and take on some color, I'm going to start temping it, shuffling the pieces around and putting them closer to the heat source if they're not coming up to temp fast enough. I'm looking for 130 Fahrenheit in the thickest part of the breast, 140 in the dark meat. Smoking is a pretty hands-off process, so it's a good time to make some spicy sllo. I'm starting by having and removing the core from one head of green cabbage and then shredding it to your mouth preferences. I like a kind of chunkier slaw. And then for a less runny extra crispy sllo, I like to brine the cabbage, heavily salting a big bowl of ice water, whisking thoroughly to make sure that all the salt is dissolved. Adding the cabbage and letting it hang out in the fridge for 1 to 4 hours. This both seasons the cabbage and makes it extra crisp. Then for the dressing, the only way to go is homemade mayo. In a slender container the same width as the head of your immersion blender, we're combining a half clove of garlic, a whole egg, juice of half a lemon, no lemon seeds, that's that's illegal, a/ teaspoon of Dijon mustard and a generous pinch of kosher salt. Blitz this a few times with your immersion blender until it is smooth and then keeping the blender head in the container. We're slowly streaming one cup of neutral oil like canola or vegetable down the side of the cup so that it settles on top of the egg. Then starting from the bottom and pulsing our way up, we're blasting the immersion blender on full speed, very quickly, forming a smooth, creamy mayo. It's way better than anything you're ever going to get out of a jar, and it comes together in about 5 minutes. Now, to make the sllo, we're rinsing and then thoroughly towling off our cabbage and making a dressing from our homemade mayo. Little splash, tablespoon or two of white wine vinegar. Then I want this to be a spicy sllo. So I'm going to add a generous sprinkling of Cajun seasoning. Roughly a tablespoon of white sugar. A few generous twists of freshly ground black pepper and a healthy drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil. Whisk until homogeneous taste for seasoning. And then it's time to add the veg. We got our whole head of shredded cabbage. Three stalks of celery thinly sliced. One quarter red onion thinly sliced. And three serrano chilis thinly sliced. Mix it up until it's all evenly dressed. Taste for seasoning. And fridge until ready to eat. Back outside on the grill. It's time to start painting and crisping. The chicken has reached its various target temperatures, so I'm coating it with barbecue sauce and cranking up the heat directly under the chicken. After about 5 minutes, you should start to see and hear charring and sizzling taking place. Once the bottom's picked up some nice color, it's time to flip things over and char the skin. You're going to lose a little bit of your gooey barbecue coating at this point, but don't worry, there's plenty of opportunities to paint it back on. Flip everybody over and close the grill down for another 3 to 5 minutes until the skin starts to pick up some really nice dark color. Paint the bottoms and flip things back over one more time. Giving our pieces one last coat of paint and shutting things down to finish cooking. At this point, if the chicken isn't done yet, crank down the heat and let it finish coming up to temp. We're looking for breast to register 155 Fahrenheit and dark meat to register 175. Plate up with extra sauce and a big pile of spicy Cajun sllo. And there you have it. Barbecue chicken on a gas grill. No recipe involved, just tasting and testing as you go. And it is every bit as fantastic as it looks. Now, if you prefer to follow more specific directions or if you're just starting out, we are going to have a written recipe on the website. But barbecue chicken is a great opportunity to experiment and try things out as you go. There are plenty of moments when you can correct or augment. And even if things go terribly wrong, it's still going to be pretty good. But when they go right, it's really," really good. [Music] [Music]""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6pUPZFzSAIs,"bite after bite after bite. You just constantly are surprised, dizzying array of flavors and textures by these people who are exercising a craft that takes time to master. So, what did it feel like to be named the number one barbecue spot in Texas? We were so new that we didn't think we were even eligible to get it. We had only been open for a year before we got that title as number one. But luckily, we worked at some restaurants that had that title or pretty close in the top 10. So, we knew like what was coming. All the owners are still working every day. So, so that's us keeping that quality up. You know, we knew we had to do after we got number one. And so, you guys are high school friends. Yep. Actually, we've known each other since about fifth grade. So, yeah, it goes back a long time. I knew a couple of the guys in kindergarten. What time did you guys get here? You're first in line. Six. We came from uh Boston, Massachusetts on a whim decided to book a ticket to go to Goldies for the weekend. It's probably some of the best brisket I've ever had. And what does it feel like to come out here and see people camping out? Um, no, it's it's a great feeling. Um, I know before we got number one, you know, we'd be nervous. We'd open up the doors at 11:00. There's one party out there. So, now to see that, you know, we got, you know, hundreds of people before we open up is a great feeling. I don't want you to give away any of your secrets, but is there anything you can tell us about Goldie's Barbecue that makes it unique? Um, that's the thing with us. We really don't um have secrets. Is this banana pudding? Yeah. I'm allergic, but bananas. Yeah. Oh, no worry. There's no bananas in there. That's our secret. There's really no big secret to barbecue. It's really just trial and error. We're up to like in the thousands for brisketss now. Jesus Christ, dude. Can't believe I wore khakis like a dunce. I almost wore a white shirt. How does it feel to have the best barbecue in Texas all myself while a bunch of peeons wait outside for me to finish? No, I'm kidding. This is unbelievable that like I get to have an experience like this that most people are camping out for that they're getting here before the pit masters do. I'm very very grateful that they let us do this and um I'm not gonna waste time and I'm going to savor each and every bite that I can manage to take. This is the brisket right there. Pork ribs or spare ribs right here. Beef rib. Everybody knows that. Nice smoked pork belly too right there. That's goes really well with this peach sauce in that corner. We have some turkey somewhere tucked down in there. And then we have our three sausages. So we have our house sausage which like it's a pepper and mustard seed kind of a base sausage. And we have a jalapeno cheese. Then we have our le oceanian sausage that comes with a sticky rice and a dipping sauce, some jou, pull pork, and a tiger cry sauce. Sides, we have our kale, coleslaw, cheesy grits, Carolina pork hash, pinto beans, potato salad, and then we have our bread pudding, and then we have our banana pudding. We also have, yeah, our homemade uh bread. So, there you have it, folks. A full platter of the best barbecue in Texas. Not many people know this, actually, that Texas is very famous for barbecue. To be the best in Texas, that's a big deal. Barbecue's big in Texas. Everything's big in Texas. Brad, any recommendations for how to tackle this or just follow my heart? I think you just got to go and um pork belly. I mean, that's my favorite thing, but I feel like you got kind of got to start on the brisket. So, you're all right. We'll enjoy, man. Thank you so much. Wow. I'm going to start eating it, and I'm going to try to do it relatively quick because I need help. And you can't be operating a camera with greasy fingers. I tried. Doesn't work. Oh, no. I I just spilled an entire kale salad but somehow didn't get any of my pants. So maybe, you know, God is real. I don't know. Wanted to do that. Both keep you on your toes, keep myself on my toes. I thrive on self-criticism and self-reliance and uh Jesus. Hey, thank you. Okay, let's roll. Uh he said his favorite is the pork belly, so I think I'll start there. Go heavy or go home. Oh, wow. Oh, they're really really render that down. So, the fat is just jelly. I You could spread that on a piece of toast. I just might. Pork so tender you can use it as a condiment. God, this bread, it must be bio because it's so I mean, look at the crust on it. Look at that. That's nuts. Like, that's got to be bio. Oh, yeah. That's bio. Such a move to be serving bio with barbecue. All right. So, the pork belly is fantastic. It is I'm guessing the least smoked thing on this t because it's very smoke. It's very smoky. It's very subtle and it's more about like I taste pork first and foremost and fat first and foremost. It's fantastic. So, we'll go to the brisket right here. This is a 12-hour smoked brisket. We uh get those in. They're about 16 lbs to start with. We trim them down to eight and after they're done cooking, they're around 5 lbs. We season that with a 16 mesh black pepper. So, it's kind of like a coarse ground pepper. Yep. Table salt and a mixture is pretty much our version of allow. Oh, wow. The brisket just tears apart. Look at that. That I mean, the key to great barbecue is for it to not fall off the bone of its own accord. Like, it should it should barely hang on to its shape and to its bone and all that. It should just barely be a form factor, but it shouldn't be just like shredding and falling apart. Oh, that's the best best brisket I ever had. That's unbelievable. I'm going to try their sauce here. I need them to tell me about what this is. Oh, so good. That's such good sauce. It's vinegar forward. It's got some fruity kind of elements to it. Almost like habanada or something where it's got that sort of fruity habanero flavor to it, but not the heat. I don't think it's habanada. There's I I need to know what's in that sauce. And then we have our turkey. That was cooked for about four hours. Wow, that's crazy. It's tender, but it's juicy. To to achieve that in barbecue is a miracle. Turkey breast is not dissimilar from chicken breast. If you smoke chicken breast, if you if you boil chicken breast, if you if you cook chicken breast to a state of dness like this, it's dry as paper. It becomes pulpy. Same with turkey breast. And this is both tender, fall apart tender, and it's so so moist. You can see how moist it is. Look. How do they do that? They must brine the out of this. I've never had turkey breast like that in my life. I've made my fair share of turkeys. What? I mean, I'm sorry. I made my fair share of turkeys. Turkey. And got our pork ribs right here. Those cook for about 5 hours. Beef ribs. They cook for anywhere from 8 to 10 hours. Pretty much everything's going to be seasoned with 16 m pepper. And then our version of our Lowry stew. I normally don't even go in for beef rib. I don't know why because it's awesome. Whoa, look at the smoke penetration on that meat. Whenever you see the pink ring around the meat, that's just the smoke that's permeated into it. Barely a little bit of brownish gray in the center. It's mostly smoke. Slap a little sauce. One of their secrets has got to be the cows that they're using. All these pieces are so loaded with fat. Let me hold up a piece of brisket so you can see. Oh my god, look at that, dude. That is some incredibly well marbled brisket. Look at the sheer amount of fat, interuscular fat. Like, there's a big strip of it right here, but then if you look at the meat itself, it's just woven with fat. And you can just see how juicy it is when I give a little squeeze. Like see how juicy it is. And you can see how tender it is. Like that's exactly where you want to live for brisket. You should be able to pull it apart with minimal effort. I got to be making Brad hungry here. So, all right. Next up, we have the pork ribs. Once again, that perfect tensile strength where the bones are just hanging on. You can crack the meat off the bone a little bit, but it should be toothsome. It shouldn't be just falling [Music] off. Oh. Oh. Oh, that pepperc corn rub is unreal. This has so much flavor. You see that? It just just barely pulls off the bone. Just takes a little tiny bit of effort. That is perfection. And then also we have some of the le oceanos stuff we do. So we have a leosian sausage down there that's going to have a lime leaf, cilantro, there's garlic. It's a really good sausage. Goes with this jou sum right there and sticky rice. You kind of eat it together. M. It has some of the elements of like Thai curry. That lime leaf, those chilies. Good amount of spice. Little bit of heat is hitting me in the back of my throat. Nothing too crazy though. See if I can nail down another one here. He did say to eat it with the sticky rice. I love eating that sausage with that sticky rice cuz well it's sticky so it like kind of sticks to your teeth just a tiny bit the way sticky rice is supposed to. It just makes the sausage feel all the more like unctuous and mouth coating because it becomes a sticky experience. I think that was like a classic Texas pork sausage. This one looks a little darker, a little redder. So this if it is if he did say and this would indicate and definitely spiced differently. I don't know if it's andwooi but it's got a bit of a richer rounder flavor to it. And then we have our pull pork and a tiger cry sauce. Kind of like a spicier sauce. It tastes really good. Some of the best pull pork I think in the country. Oh wow. Wow. That tiger cry sauce. It's chilies. There's cilantro in there, but I'm I'm choosing not to experience it. Ton of lime. Like you're used to having a acidic sauce with pul pork cuz you usually have a vinegar based barbecue sauce. So this is ticking that box. But it's also just loaded with some kind of red chili that you can really plainly see. It has an incredible bark. And you can see it's just loaded with these red chilies. They're rubbing this pork down with some kind of chili sauce. I can't assert as to whether or not that's the best in the nation, but it's the best I've ever had. And then we have our Carolina pork hash. Try to get rid of some of our trim from our pork rib scrap. So we'll braze that in stock and then add like a mustard sauce to it and put it over a bed of rice. It's really good. It's kind of like a pork gravy almost sauce. Oh. Oh my. That's different. That's first time I'm really tasting Le Oceanian influence there. The big scallions and there's some spices in there. I think you said lime leaf. Some very familiar Southeast Asian flavors uh happening there. And a little bit of heat. Nice bit of heat. That's really nice. Then we have our potato salad, but a whole bunch of veggies in there. Another thing to lighten up the the load you're eating. Oh, that's nice. celery seed, mustard, my favorite kind of potato salad, which is half potato chunks, half mash, you know, it's like a chunky mash pretty much. And it is, like he said, just loaded with vegetables. Lots of bright fresh crunch. Fantastic cheese grits. You always need something kind of cheesy on the plate. We're really not macaroni fans. They really don't hold too well during service. They look like to me like they have pimento in them. Like pimeto cheese. They have that nice orange color. Yeah. Yeah, you never think that you wouldn't miss mac and cheese, but that really ticks the box. I love grits and these are really properly cooked grits. They're toothsome, but not, you know, undercooked. Fantastic. And then we have our lemon kale slaw. So, we'll cut all the cabbage every week. Lemon, it's more of a vinegaret. It's not really mayo based. We We like that more. I feel like eating all this heavy food. Need something a little light. It's crazy. It's a vinegrett based slot. If my eyes were closed, I would have told you it was creamy because it tastes quite rich, but it's still got that nice vinegrett sort of um bright bite going through. This is a perfect thing to have with barbecue. You need something light to cut through all this this insanity. And then we have our classic pinto beans right there. Nicely cooked beans, too. They're super tender, but they're not mushy. A lot Everything here is like barely held together by its own structure. Ceases to exist the second that you put it in your mouth. All that's left is dessert. So, we have our bread pudding. We make that with all the bread ends from our homemade bread and we put it kind of in like a bourbon um sauce in there too. And then we have our bananaless banana pudding and uh we make our own crumble from wafers. Add some uh salt, sugar, and cinnamon to that. This is the banana pudding which apparently I love that he just straight up called it banana pudding. I was like I'm allergic and he was like oh there's no bananas. That's really funny. Looks really rich and smooth and creamy. God, that's so good. There's a ton of warming spices. Like I'd be just as comfortable eating this in the dead of winter, which doesn't happen here. Super smooth. Then a nice little bit of crunch. This really scratches the banana puddingish, even though it doesn't specifically taste like bananas. And I think if you told the told me, ""Here's banana pudding,"" I'd be like, ""Oh, this is great banana pudding."" I wouldn't be like, ""Where's the bananas, you liar?"" And then there's the slightly warm bread pudding, which looks freaking nuts. Oh, it's just loaded with the what looks like a glaze. [Music] careful. Remember the kale salad? That is definitely the best bread pudding I've ever had cuz it's this bio that they make in house. Butterladen, rich vanillay, maybe even brown butter glaze on top. Oh, that's spectacular. Wow. I'm already full and it the plate looks like I just moved it around. It doesn't look like I ate anything. It just looks like I shuffled stuff. I don't want to create a disaster on the plane. So, I'm sorry to disappoint you that this will not be a mukbang. I need to be on American Airlines flight 2089 in approximately 3 hours. This sounds so obvious for me to say. I was about to say I can see why this place was named the number one barbecue in Texas. I don't have too much exposure to Texas barbecue. I've been to Terry Blacks in Austin, which is like the most famous place in Austin. have been Salt Lake, which I guess has gone downhill in recent years. And uh none of them hold a candle to this. Jaylen made a um inspired choice when they decided to really focus on their sides as much as they do their meat. Because even at a legendary place like Terry Blacks, the sides are an afterthought. The macaroni and cheese is cheese sauce with some noodles swimming around in it that have been sitting in a in a um a steam table all day. I'm so grateful to be able to try it because there's no way in hell I would wait in that line. When I turned like 35, I decided I'm never waiting in line again for anything. I don't care if it's for the hospital. I'm not waiting in line. I'll die out here on the sidewalk. This food is a story. It's heritage. It's time and effort. It's practice. It's trial and error. Nowadays, in our modern world, no food was made around the corner. None of it. every aspect of every ingredient of every spice of every uh uh subtlety was mined or farmed or gathered or hunted or killed around the world, processed around the world, handed through tens of thousands of hands before it reached you. These are all Texas cows sitting before me. They probably grew up down the way. Then it's been handled and loved into perfection by people who really care about what they're doing and really know about what they're doing because they've tried and failed and tried again until they got it right. That's the story of this food. And another story behind it is their friendship. Some of these guys have known each other since kindergarten. Do you know anybody you went to kindergarten with? I don't. I remember getting like bullied a little bit. No, kindergarten probably not. This is friendship on a plate and that's something you can take to the barbecue bank. You can that and you can sign your name and that's a drop and that's a beat we can all drop. Can I eat some food now? Oh, did you want to eat this? Yeah, dude. Get in here. Let's roll.

lz7dl6vq9NU,"Hey, what's up guys? Welcome back to Binging with Babish. I want to thank you all very much for participating in the Reddit AMA last week. So this week I'm going to be recreating the top voted suggestion which was ratatouille. Now I've been told by some uh very emphatic commenters that this is not real ratatouille. This is something called kibialdi which is sort of like a modern spin on ratatouille. So we're going to start off by blanching some tomatoes for about 30 seconds until the skins start to peel. And then we're going to peel them before roasting some peppers. Yellow, orange, and red or just red. Who cares? Char on all sides over an open flame until blackened. Make sure you use metal tongs, not plastic ones like me. I'm being stupid right now. Cover the hot steaming peppers with some aluminum foil and let them steam in their own steaminess for a few minutes. This will help soften the peppers and make them a little bit easier to peel, which we're going to do right now. I'll peel off all the black stuff and you're left with these beautiful roastedriccolored peppers which we're going to combine in a high-powered blender with three Roma tomatoes, a few sprigs of parsley, two whole garlic cloves, a few sprigs of picked thyme leaves, a quarter of a white onion, and a little bit of chicken stock that we're going to pour in as the blender is running. Oh, little bit of olive oil before I forget. Now, I don't want to discolor the mixture too much, so I'm also going to use a little bit of hot water before pressing the vegetables down into the blender and creating sort of like a roasted red pepper soup. The cool thing about high-powered blenders is that it actually cooks the mixture if you let it run at high speed long enough. Now, it's time to create those famous shingles of sliced vegetables. We need to use a very, very sharp knife on the tomatoes to create thin little slices and then use a mandolin to make life a little bit easier with one yellow and one green squash. And then my mandolin kind of sucks. So I'm going to slice my eggplant by hand. Chop a little bit of fresh rosemary to sprinkle over top before spreading a thin even layer of our roasted red pepper sauce on the bottom of a rectangular or oval roaster. Now we're going to start shingling vegetables alternating in a pattern across the bottom of the dish. Now this was my first crack and I cut the vegetables a little bit too thick and stacked them a little bit too far apart. We'll revisit that later. For now, drizzle a little bit of olive oil across the top of the vegetables. Seasoned with salt, freshly ground pepper, and our finely chopped fresh rosemary before topping with a sheet of parchment paper that we've cut to the shape of our baking dish and placing in a 225° oven for about 90 minutes until it comes out looking like this. Now, this tasted really good, but for that Pixar style plating, we need thinner vegetables stacked closer together, cooked for less time, like so. Into a ring mold, we're going to stack some vegetables vertically, then horizontally, like so. Lift it off a little bit slower than necessary for a dramatic effect. Swirl some olive oil and leftover red pepper sauce around the outside along with some fresh picked parsley leaves. And let's see if this is good enough to save a restaurant from an evil reviewer. Okay guys, first things first. Let's bring one Friday to a party. I'm screaming hot. I need to go get back. Whoa. Whoa. Okay. What was in that ratatouille? Just vegetables, I think. Okay. Whoops. And I forgot Rey's single chive garnish over top. My bad. Hang on. Let's see if I can remember what happened to my hamster when I was [Music] [Applause] [Music] five. Hey, what's up, guys? Welcome back to Binging with Babish, where this week we're taking a look at the bow bones from Pixar's Bow, aka one of those rare moments I get to use a recipe directly from the source. Because director Doi provided her mother's recipe for bow, which starts with 4 cups of allpurpose flour, 3/4 of a teaspoon of dry yeast, tiny whisk together before adding 500 ml or 2.1 cups of water to the party. We're just going to fold that together using a rubber spatula until a cohesive dough forms. At which point, we're going to turn it out onto a lightly flowered countertop, kneading and adding flour or water as necessary, until it's not too sticky, not too dry. Then, we're going to lightly oil a bowl for rising purposes. Plop our dough inside, cover, and let rest for 2 hours. And please take note, this is the time during which you should make the pork filling. I didn't do this, and I will regret it for the rest of my life. Anyway, after its 2-hour rest, the dough should about double in size. Mine is still pretty sticky, so I'm going to turn it out onto a heavily flowered work surface. I'm going to give it a little bit of kneading just to sort of help it come together. And then I'm going to do what she did in the short, which is punch a hole in the center of the dough and stretch it out using what's called the windmill technique, I think. And then I'm chopping that guy into two pieces, stretching them out end to end, and then dividing those into 1 in pieces. And see, this is where I messed up. The filling wasn't ready, so the dough balls had to sit out for too long, and they ended up proofing twice. So, I ended up having to make it all over again. So, as is sometimes the case on this show, do as I say, not as I do. So, now for the filling, I'm finally chopping up a small carrot, two scallions, and a small head of Chinese cabbage. Then, in a large bowl, I'm placing half a pound of ground pork and sautéing the other half in a little bit of vegetable oil until it's nice and golden brown. Then, once it is so, I'm bringing it back to the bowl and adding it to the raw pork. I'm sure that she does this to amp up the porky flavor of our filling. Then once you've got that all combined, it's time to add our Chinese cabbage, carrot, scallions, and some flavor boosters, including but not limited to 1 to two teaspoons of ground ginger, 1 teaspoon of very difficult to pour and measure oyster sauce. 2 to 3 tsps of equally difficult to measure Chinese cooking wine. 1 teaspoon of much easier to measure toasted sesame oil, or go ahead and add more if you really know how to party. 1 teaspoon, let's make it 2 tsps of olive oil. A half a teaspoon of chicken bullion powder. And salt and freshly ground pepper to taste. Granted, this is kind of hard to do when you can't actually taste it, but you know, just eyeball it. Plus, we're going to add one beaten egg. Then, with optionally gloved hands, we're going to mix the whole affair together until homogeneous. Then, it's time to take a crack at doing something that I've been dreading for a long time, filling and shaping bow. First, we're rolling out our dough pieces to about 4 in wide and then dumping about a tablespoon's worth of pork filling into the center. Then, we got to close it up using this complicated pleing and twisting technique, which I didn't do a very good job of on my first goound, so I'll highlight how to do this later. This recipe ended up making about 24 bow with plenty of leftover pork filling. So, you might want to double the dough recipe because once they're rolled up, they freeze beautifully, but I'm going to place these in my bamboo steamer basket and steam them for 15 minutes and then letting them rest undisturbed for 5 minutes before even taking a peek at them. Hands off. So, 20 excruciatingly hungry minutes later, we've got our bow buns. And here is where I learned another very valuable lesson. You've got to oil the parchment paper with which you line your bamboo steamer, or else you're going to have this happen. Your delicate dumpling wrapper is going to rip. And once again, you're going to have to start all over. And now, after a very long day, we're going to keep our fingers crossed and release. Nice. And now, finally, it's time to give these things a try. And I got to say, they're really, really good. The filling is super flavorful. The wrapper is nice and chewy. But subconsciously, I had been really in the mood for charu Bao, which usually has a lighter, fluffier bun and an alien red pork filling. So, why don't we take a crack at that? First, we're going to start by making a marinade for our pork. two tablespoons of white sugar, two tablespoons of hoisan sauce, 1 tbsp of fermented red bean paste, a tablespoon of soy sauce, a tablespoon of Chinese cooking wine or meticulously crushed cloves of garlic, and ideally some freshly grated ginger, but I'm just going to use some dried stuff. That's all I have on hand. It'll be fine. Mix that together. And then it's time to prep our pork. I'm going with some thick slices of pork belly that I'm going to remove the skin from, place in a plastic parcel, and dump our marinade over top. Then we're going to refrigerate for 24 hours. Be sure to place this on a plate or in a glass bowl to prevent crosscontamination with other things in the fridge. It's the next day and for the dough, we're going to measure out 300 g of allpurpose flour, to which we're going to add 40 g of white sugar, which is going to act as food to 2 tsp of yeast. And then to make our yeast grow up big and strong, we're going to add 185 ml of whole milk, heated to 110° F, and 1 tbsp of vegetable oil. And then we're dropping our dough hook into the mixture and kneading for 8 minutes until a smooth, supple ball of dough forms. Then we are removing the dough from and oiling up the bowl. Returning the dough to the bowl, covering and resting for 2 hours as before. And since we learned our lesson earlier, we're going to prep our pork filling in the meantime. In a small bowl, we are combining equal parts, about 2 tbsps worth of oyster sauce, hoisen sauce, a heaping teaspoon of honey, maybe a teaspoon of Chinese fivespice powder, and about a tablespoon each of soy sauce, Chinese cooking wine, and fermented red bean paste. And there you have it. charu sauce, which is kind of like a delicious Chinese barbecue sauce. Give that a little tiny whisking. And then it's time to prep our pork. First, we're going to lightly oil a grate set in a rimmed baking sheet. And why don't we line it with foil, too? This is probably going to get pretty messy. Then, how about we get this pork out onto a tray? Nice. Okay. Then, we're going to divide our charu sauce in half cuz we're going to use some for brushing down the pork belly and the rest for tossing with the finished meat. And now this pork is going into a 450° Fahrenheit oven for about 10 minutes until it just starts developing a nice char on the outside. And then we're going to flip and brush it down again. Place it back in the oven for another 5 to 10 minutes until it starts charring up again. Rinsing and repeating until we reach 180° internal and the exterior is beautifully caramelized and nicely charred. Then we're going to let this cool until it's nice and cooled off. And then we're going to chop the belly into nice little tiny pieces which we're going to then in turn toss with the remaining charu sauce. Try not to eat this with a spoon like it's a bowl of cereal because it's headed into our bow, you selfish weirdo. From this point on, it's the same process as before, but I got a little bit better at rolling up these bows, as they're sometimes called. So, basically, you just want to pleat the edges together like this, going all the way around until the filling is encased, and then give it a little twist to seal shut. This is how it gets that chubby little dumpling baby look. Then, we are placing onto our generously oiled parchment paper inside of our bamboo steamer, steaming for 15 minutes and letting rest for five. And there you go, some dim sum style charu bao, which are intensely tasty. Are they better than doishi's mom's bow? Absolutely not. They're totally different and both totally delicious. And I'd happily raise either of them as my own child. Oh, Edgar, you sly old fox. It's criminal Edgar. Just a few dunks. Oo, very good. My compliments to the chef. Hey, what's up guys? Welcome back to Binging with Babish where this week I forgot to shoot that sort of intro walk-in shot. So, we're diving right into it. And for creme de la creme Ala Edgar, we need crackers. What kind of looked like Ritz crackers to me. So, we're starting with 10 ounces of allpurpose flour, 3 tesp of baking powder, half a teaspoon of kosher salt, and 1 tbsp of granulated sugar. We're just going to process that together a little bit just to let those dry ingredients and leavenveners get to know each other. And then we're adding 6 tablespoons of refrigerator cold butter. We're almost making a pie crust here, but in addition to the butter, we're also going to add 2 tablespoon of vegetable oil to give a little bit of that snack aisle processed goodness. Speaking of processed, we're going to process this together in the food processor. Just pulse a few times and then let it run for about 5 seconds until everybody's nice and sandy. Then into the feed tube, we're going to slowly drizzle 2/3 of a cup of ice water while the machine's running, just until a ball of dough forms, about 10 seconds. Then we're going to take this guy out, wrap him up in plastic wrap, and let him rest in the fridge for 10 to 15 minutes. We're not being as cautious with this dough as we would a pie crust cuz we don't want it to puff as much as a pie crust would puff if a pie crust could puff wood. But anyway, we are turning this out onto a very liberally flowered work surface and rolling it out as thin as humanely possible. It helps to have one of these rolling pins with little pacifiers on the side that help you maintain an even thickness. But no matter what you're rolling with, just try to roll it out as thin as you possibly can. Then we need to utilize a fluted biscuit cutter to give our crackers that signature Ritz look. I think this one's a little bit small. I'm going to go one bigger. There we go. That's a cracker. And we're simply arranging these on a parchment line baking sheet that we are going to insert into a 400° Fahrenheit oven. But not before trying in vain to cut that little cross pattern into each individual cracker only to give up and go for the signature Ritz seven dots. Six on the outside, one in the middle. I didn't even have to do a Google image search. Now brushing these boys down with butter. These are, after all, butter crackers, and they require a great multitude of butter applications. Okay, now these guys are ready to go into that oven that I talked about for 10 to 15 minutes until they're nice and brown, but not too brown cuz we're going to brush them down again one more time with butter and immediately sprinkle them with a little bit of kosher salt. I emphasize immediately because the butter dries very quickly and you need the salt to stick before it does. And with that second butter bath, we got ourselves a nice golden cracker that I got to say tastes exactly like a Ritz. And this only took like an hour. So much easier than going to the store and spending $2 on arguably a better version. On to creme de la creme Ala Edgar. I'm starting off with a pint of heavy cream to which I'm going to add an equal part of whole milk. Then Edgar adds five things: vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, sugar, and sleeping pills. The last one, of course, being optional and probably illegal. Now, he used vanilla extract, but I'm going to go with a whole bean. This is, after all, for human and not kitty consumption. So, I'm going to scrape a whole vanilla bean and add it to our milky mixture along with the pot itself for a little bit of added flavor. Now, to four cups of beverage, I think you're going to want to add between 1/4 to a/3 of a cup of sugar, 1/4 teaspoon of ground cinnamon, and maybe another 1/4 teaspoon of freshly grated nutmeg. You can use the preg groundown stuff if you want, but freshly grated really is worlds better. Grab your tiny whisk, and let's give this guy a stir. I think tiny whisk could use a little calcium anyway, so it can grow up big and wo Well, that's proof, kids. Drink your milk. I'm also going to add just a little pinch of salt and a generous shake of barbituate sleeping aids, just like they would have prescribed very safely in Paris in 1910. And I got to say, this stuff tastes real, real good. What we've effectively made here is hot vanilla, the slightly worse cousin of hot chocolate. But it's still real, real good, and I do recommend you trying it. But let's try it the way Rokafort the mouse tries it. Dipping a cracker in and taking little mouse bites. And what we're effectively doing here is dipping pie crust pieces into hot vanilla. So, it's pretty good. I would probably just have one or the other, not both. But still, no complaints. However, I don't think that I'm getting the full Roker experience. For that, I think we need to think like a mouse, or rather make a bigger cracker, which is not exactly what a mouse would do, but just let me have my catchphrases, please. So, same dough rolled out, cut with a dinner plate as a mold. Then, I was kind of stumped on how to give it the fluted edges, but then I found this ravioli cutter that worked pretty well. The fluting is kind of small, but good enough for me. Also, this is an opportunity to cut the same pattern into this cracker that we see in the movie. But other than that, same procedure. Brush the whole thing down with butter. 400 degree Fahrenheit oven for 10 to 15 minutes, rotating once during baking. I know that this is not quite to scale, but this is as big as my baking sheets would allow me. And there you have it. About as big a cracker as I've ever seen, which I'm going to again brush down with butter and hurriedly sprinkle with salt and attempt to dip into a larger bowl of our cremeilla cremeala Edgar. Again, sorry, I know it's not to scale, but I didn't want to be too wasteful. And the odds of me eating all this cracker and drinking all this milk are very extremely not going to happen. However, I will enjoy a few mouselike nibbles before fixing myself a mug of this hot vanilla. Cuz let me tell you, that stuff is good. Not hot chocolate good, but good. [Music] Hey, what's up guys? Welcome back to Binging with Babish, where this week we are ringing in the new year with the storied gray stuff from Beauty and the Beast, which I think Oh, I thought this might be have food under it. I guess we have to make it. Now, I know the folks at Disney said to their animator, Frank, just draw us a plate of appetizers. Okay, nobody is going to agonize over it 30 years later on a big TV trying to figure out what each element is. So, just put some appetizers on there. We don't care if they don't make sense. So, anyway, over here we have a mystery tea sandwich. I think it might be some kind of fig spread. Maybe with some goat cheese or something. That'd be cool. Then up here we've got some salmon mousse with a cucumber and what I think is a buckwheat blie. Then we got ourselves a pig and a blanket. No mistaking that. Then over here, I have no earthly idea what this is. Again, I think Frank was just like, I'm going to keep my head down, do my job. Michael Eisner is not going to fire me. Not today. I have a pension to think about. Then up here, we've got a cucumber tea sandwich. Pretty simple. Then down here, I think we've got some salmon row on top of another buckwheat blie. Definitely not my favorite. Then we got a little roll of meat with what looks like a little strip of cheese and maybe some roasted peppers on top. And then finally, the gray stuff pictured here twice, which has been erroneously reported and maliciously marketed as some kind of cookies and cream red velvet cupcake nonsense. But this is a tray of order. What we got here is most likely fuagra or chicken liver mousse. I'm going with the ladder because I don't want people to get mad at me. So, I'm patting dry about half a pound of chicken livers and then finally mincing one shallot and a little bit of fresh thyme, maybe a teaspoon worth. And then we are headed over to the stove top where we are preheating a little bit of vegetable oil over mediumigh heat until shimmering. Adding the chicken livers and letting sit undisturbed for one to two minutes until they are nice and brown on one side. Give them a little flip so they can start browning on the other side. And we're going to add our shallots and thyme. Saute together for another minute just to let those flavors get to know each other a little bit. And then we're going to delaze with maybe 1/4 cup of conac. If you have a fire extinguisher nearby and you know what you're doing, go ahead and flame this if you like, but it doesn't really do anything for the flavor. It's kind of just for showboating. And now that the livers are brown on the outside and pink on the inside, I'm going to add the zest of half a lemon. Kill the heat, let it cool down for like 30 seconds, and then add a/4 cup of heavy cream. Swirl it around a little bit just to make sure that everybody's acquainted. And then it's time to head over to an awaiting blender or food processor into which we're going to deposit the contents of our pan. Then we're going to crank the blender on a medium low speed and one chunk at a time add 1 and 1/2 sticks of unsalted butter. Yeah, that's a lot of butter, but this is also going to be a lot of delicious. So once all the butter is added, we're going to crank this thing on high and blend it until very, very smooth. And then we're going to pass it through a fine mesh strainer to catch any little bits. And there you have it, chicken liver mousse. And we need to cover it with the plastic wrap pressed down onto the surface of the mousse because that's how this stuff becomes gray when it oxidizes. So next up, we're going to make some salmon mousse. I'm starting with about 3 4 oz of smoked salmon to which I'm going to add the juice of 1/2 of one lemon and 4 oz or half a bar of nu chhatel cheese because that feels a little bit more French and appropriate, but it's virtually identical to cream cheese. So, you can just go ahead and use cream cheese if you want. Puree until smooth and mousse-like. And then we're going to cover that and refrigerate until ready to use it. Next up are pigs and mystery objects in a blanket. I'm going to go with dates. They're similarly brown, kind of craggly, and they're a really nice appetizer when you stuff them with blue cheese. Then normally you'd wrap them in bacon before roasting, but puff pastry is going to be a nice substitute if you want to keep it vegetarian, I guess. So then it's time to bust out the puff. Roll it out a little bit on a generously fled work top. And then we're slicing them into maybe 3-in long triangles, which we can then roll around our cocktail wieners and blue cheese stuffed dates, starting at the broadside and sealing with a little bit of egg wash if it's not sticking together. Regardless, we are brushing everybody down with a little bit of egg wash for presentation's sake. And I'm going to sprinkle everybody with a little bit of kosher salt, both for flavor and presentation. And then we're going to roast for about 20 minutes at 375 or until brown and puffed. Next up, we got to make ourselves some buckwheat blanies. In a large bowl, I am combining 75 g of allpurpose flour, 60 g of buckwheat flour, 15 g of sugar and 5 g of yeast. Just going to whisk those to combine using regularized whisk. And then I'm adding 1 cup of whole milk heated to 110° F. Warm milk is going to give our yeast a little bit of a boost. And at this point, I'm going to add a little pinch of salt. and then gently whisk until smooth. Now, this is basically a yeasted pancake batter. So, we need to let it rest for an hour. Covered with plastic wrap at room temperature so that yeast can munch down on that sugar. An hour later, and you should see that your batter has doubled in volume. And at this point, we're going to add some eggs. We're going to try to crack one, fail miserably. Ponder how we managed to make this our full-time job as we fish out all the shell fragments. Add a second egg and then lightly beat them together before pouring directly into the batter. In addition, we're also going to add 2 tablesp of melted butter. Make sure it's not hot, just melted. We do not want to scramble those eggs. And then we're going to whisk until everybody's homogeneous and smooth and incorporated. And then pour the whole affair into a large squeeze bottle. This is going to make making tiny pancakes a lot easier. Go ahead and demonstrate it on your countertop for some reason. Perfect. And make sure you don't overfill your bottle or this is going to happen. It's a yeasted batter and it's going to expand. Anyway, once we got that all cleaned up, it's time to make some blinies, which are essentially silver dollar pancakes. And as is the case with all pancakes, the first batch is going to look weird. But as you make batch after batch, you will soon find yourself flipping perfect panners. It's the life lesson universal to all pancakes. Never give up. Once the pancakes are done cooking, about a minute on each side, I'm going to place them onto a paper towel just to cool off a bit before we serve. Now onto those little meat roll things. I think you can use pretty much any charerie that you want. I'm going with mortadella because it's my favorite. I know it's not French, but sorry. And then I'm going to wrap it with an ultra thin slice of griier. Top it with some tiny little slices of roasted red pepper and skewer with a toothpick. And there you have it. Definitely the easiest appetizer of the bunch and maybe my favorite. Whoops. Shoot. Where'd it go? Need to make another one. And now on to the tea sandwiches. I'm just arranging some thinly sliced cucumbers, a smear of nuhatel cheese, and fresh dill. Then we're slicing off the crusts and cutting into neat little tea sandwiches. Next up, the goat cheese and fig one. I just have some goat cheese here and some fig jam. Simple enough. I think I would have went a little bit too heavy on the goat cheese there. But now it's time for the assembled platter. Been waiting to do this for a long time. Be our guest. All right, so let's go through and try all these. First, the little blue cheese dates puff pastry thing. And this is pretty good. It's actually a lot less rich than the bacon version, and I kind of like it. Next up, pick in a blanket. Tail as old as time. And huge shocker, it's really good. Next up, we got us some salmon mousse with cucumber on a blinie, and it's pretty nice. I mean, I wouldn't order in a restaurant, but I'd certainly eat it. Now, we got some fig and goat cheese. And this one's pretty good. I think I went too heavy with the goat cheese, but if you went a little bit more restrained with it, you'd have a very good tea sandwich. Then let's get rid of this inappropriate olive on the cucumber tea sandwich. And this guy is a home run. Just maybe add a little bit of kosher salt during the assembly process. Mortadella roll winner. Now I don't have to eat this salmon road and know that I'm going to hate it, but I am a food recreation scientist and I have an obligation. And finally, the gray stuff. Let's do a finger taste like Belle did. Really good. And it can definitely use a more robust cracker, prettier piping. But you heard it here, folks. The gray stuff. The real gray stuff is delicious. Dinner's ready. [Music] Are you okay? Google Translate. Hey, what's up guys? Welcome back to Bing with Babish, where this week we are once again playing with fire in the form of a simple traditional regional Italian recipe. Tranete al pesto is a simple enough dish, but as usual with Italian cuisine, the devil is in the details. There's like pesto, the kind of basil and pine nutbased pesto with which you're probably most familiar. Plenty of ways for us to get into trouble. And then there's the trend, which from what I can tell is a little bit wider than linguini. Not quite as wide as fetuccini, but shares its flatness. Honestly, all that really matters is that you use pasta of the utmost quality. And then there's some yellow waxy potatoes and green beans. We're going to peel and small dice the potatoes and cut the green beans down into like 1 in segments. Then comes the pesto for which we're going to follow Pixar's posted recipe. 30 g of pine nuts, two cloves of chopped garlic and a pinch of coarse salt head into a mortar and pestle where they get processed into an almost creamy paste. Then we're adding 50 g or 45 leaves of fresh basil stems removed. At this point, you might start to wish that you had a slightly larger mortar and pestle. But go ahead and soldier on processing the basil leaves until they just start to break down. At which point, we're going to start slowly adding some high quality olive oil. Nothing too spicy or fruity. We want a nice mellow flavor. And we want to add 100 mil of it, one little splash at a time while we slowly process together the pesto. This is going to help emulsify it into a creamy sauce rather than an oily mess. Another thing that's going to help emulsify it is cheese. about 2 tablespoons each pigano reano and pecarino romano. Once you've added all the oil and the sauce is smooth and creamy with the consistency of say a heavy cream, you are ready to rock. Now you might be asking yourself, is it worth setting your forearms on fire to slowly and laboriously coax these ingredients into a sauce or can you just throw everything in a food processor and blitz? Well, the answer is yeah. This will still yield a mighty fine pesto. But the theory is that by bruising and mashing the basil rather than chopping it yields a more subtle, delicate, pronounced flavor. For more, we turn, as always, to a blind Jessica taste test, which quickly and resoundingly agreed with Italian tradition. The mortar and pestle version was better. My science is flawless. Do not question it. Anyway, it's time to start finally making the damn thing. We're starting by bringing our heavily salted water to the boil before adding our chopped potatoes, pasta, and green beans all at the same time. I'm not sure how I feel about this. I think it's not enough time for the potatoes and too much time for the green beans, but let's see what happens. We're cooking for about 10 minutes, reserving half a cup of pasta cooking water, straining everything, and then preparing to combine with the pesto, which we're going to do in an entirely separate bowl. It is important not to heat your pesto. About the only heat you want it to experience is the residual heat from the pasta. We're going to add some of our pasta cooking water, a little splash at a time, as we toss everything together until we've achieved the correct consistency, which should be nice and creamy both from the pesto and the pasta cooking water. are emulsifying together into a sauce and from the potatoes which should break down just a little bit and lend their starch to the situation. Once you've got this properly seasoned with kosher salt, no freshly ground pepper in this recipe apparently, go ahead and plate it up and get ready to savor the pride and joy of lurya. One of the most delicious and comforting dishes in the world. One that needs no improvement, but I want to see if I can get a little bit closer to the version in the movie. This, I assume, starts not with store-bought basil, but that which has been grown and freshly harvested in one's own backyard. I'm honestly not sure if this is going to make any appreciable difference, but as usual with Italian cuisine, it seems like the further you go for authenticity, the better. So, we're grabbing exactly 45 leaves or I don't know, somewhere around that. And this time, we are not measuring anything. We're going to do things the Italian way by using the force. We're losing the stems off our leaves of basil. I got myself some legit real deal Italian pine nuts. A beautiful head of young, freshly harvested garlic, which has a more subtle, slightly less spicy flavor than its older counterparts. By the way, you might be wondering why my nails are painted now, and the short answer is that I like the way it looks, but the thematically appropriate answer is that I got a little sea monster in me. Next up, we're busting out our real deal Italian marble, mortar, and wooden pestle. Both the authentic choice and the much easier choice because its weight is going to help cut down on forearm utilization. I'm going to lightly toast my pine nuts by tossing them around in a dry hot pan and allowing them to cool completely before processing the",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 together with the garlic. And the important thing to keep in mind when processing this stuff together is not to mix or scrape, but rather to pound. This is both going to produce a smoother, more creamy result. And it's an easier, shall we say, more familiar motion. Once we've broken the pine nuts down to a sandy consistency, I'm going to chop up the garlic a little bit, add it to the mortar, and proceed to give it a solid pestlin. Once you've got that broken down to a nice creamy, almost lumpless paste, which should take anywhere from 3 to 5 minutes, now's the time to start adding the basil leaves, one little handful at a time. Add a little pinch of coarse salt. This is going to help break down the basil leaves by acting like little sort of ball bearings of cellular destruction. Once you've got everything processed down into a pretty smooth paste, now's the time to add the cheese. This time we're using a 2:1 ratio of PMano Reiano to Pecarino Romano. This is going to give us more of a mellow, subtler cheese flavor. pound and process that into the sauce. We don't want any big old chunks of cheese. Then once you've got that down into a nice, relatively smooth paste. It's time to add the olive oil. This time we're using real Liurian olive oil. You definitely don't need to special order region specific olive oil. But once again, we're trying to as accurately as possible recreate what was enjoyed in that darling little fishing town in the Italian Riviera. Add the oil a little bit at a time, adding cheese to emulsify if the sauce starts to break, until you're met with a thick, creamy Italian pesto. Mine's a little bit chunky, but hey, that's the way I like it. And this time with the pasta, I'm adding stuff in stages. First, the potatoes because they take the longest to cook. After about five minutes of cooking, I'm going to add the green beans. Let these guys cook for about 3 minutes before adding the pasta. That's because this time I'm using a quick cooking dried tanete that only takes 2 minutes to cook. If you're using a more traditional dried pasta, go ahead and time things accordingly. Scoop out that pasta water, set it aside, drain the stuff, drop it straight in a large bowl along with our homemade pesto. Toss everything together with a little splash of pasta cooking water, adding more as necessary to emulsify the sauce. Take care not to over toss so you don't break down the potatoes too much. Pile it high in a bowl. Be sure to top with plenty of green beans and potatoes. And this time we're not going to forget to garnish with a little bit of fresh basil. And there you have it. Reete alesto made with real Italian regional local ingredients. Was it worth the extra effort? And the answer is kind of yeah. There's a lot more subtlety and sweetness to the olive oil and the young garlic. The freshly picked basil has a little bit more pronounced flavor, but if you really want to be authentic, you got to eat this like a sea monster. Even if people ask you what's wrong with you, stupid. Just laugh as you drive away on your Vespa. Have some more. No. Gracias. I asked if you would like more tamales. See, that's what I thought you said. Hey, what's up guys? Welcome back to Binging with Babish, where this week we're taking a look at the tamales from Coco. Once you've got a solid 12 hours set aside to construct your tamales. We need to start by soaking the corn husks. We want to soak these in room temperature water for at least three hours, if not overnight, just separate the husks a little bit and place them in a large pot. Make sure that they uh you know that they fit. Uh-oh. Time to break out the big guns or pots. Big pots. While those guys are soaking, we can get started on some of our fillings. I apologize for dressing down, but this was late the night before. And that's actually one of the beauties of this recipe is that you can start a day 2 days before and stop at virtually any point and pick it up the next day. You might recognize what I'm doing here. I'm making a pretty basic chili paste out of a couple different kinds of dried chilies. In this case, guilo and pia chilies. And I'm also going to add a few cloves of garlic, a few quartered tomatillos, a good squeeze of lime, a good squeeze of orange juice, a couple heaping teaspoons of cumin, preferably freshly toasted and ground in a spice grinder, but it's late and I'm not trying to wake up Rasheed. A good pinch of Mexican oregano, some salt, freshly ground pepper, and blitz into a smooth paste pretty close to what we use in our al pastor pork. Open this guy up. Take in the beautiful smells and set aside to cool completely while we deal with our pork. We're going to go with a small pork shoulder for this recipe. Make sure that you are working with appetizing pork. Very important. Clean the meat from the bone. Cut off the skin and cut into about 2-in cubes, which we're then going to place in a large Ziploc bag and cover in our marinade. Give it a little massage and fridge this for at least 3 hours. Or you could come to the shocking realization that you could just let the pork marinade in your cooking vessel. So, I'm going to place this in a foil lined casserole that I'm going to cover and fridge for at least 3 hours, or in my case, overnight. The next day, and I'm all gussied up for dinner, and I'm going to get started on making our tamalei dough. I am weighing out 560 g of Masaharina, which is a kind of instant corn flour, and adding to it 700 ml of very hot water. Giving it a good mix with a wooden spoon until a crumbly kind of dough forms. Set this aside and let it rest for 15 minutes while we start working with our lard. A lot of people freak out at the idea of lard, but it's actually not that bad for you, and it's what they use in OG legit tamales. And I'd imagine that's what the abuela in Coco is making. So, we are whipping 375 g of lard for 2 minutes in a stand mixer until it is light and fluffy, at which point we're going to add a/ teaspoon of kosher salt and a teaspoon and a half of baking powder, mixing to combine before slowly adding our soaked masa. Add maybe a third of it at a time, beating and scraping down the sides of the bowl before adding the rest. beating again until a cohesive mass forms into which we are going to slowly stream one cup of warm chicken stock. Beating one more time to combine thoroughly and create our dough. Now, this is a much thicker, fluffier dough than most tamalei doughs, but they say if you drop a piece in cold water and it floats, you're good to go. And I think that all the air that we beat in there is going to make for a lighter, less dense tamalei. Anyway, speaking of which, it's time to talk fillings. We brazed our pork for 3 hours at 275° Fahrenheit, shredded it, and added back a little bit of the marinade. I'm also going to do some roasted pablano and cheese tamales. I roasted some pablanos straight over the flame on my stove top, wrap them in foil, let them steam and soften up before we peel them. Now, at long last, it's tamalei time. We're going to start by peeling off the carbonized exterior of our pablano peppers and cutting them into strips. I could just eat a giant bowl of these alone, but we're going to add some cheese, wajaka cheese, which is kind of like a Mexican mozzarella. We're going to tear the cheese into similarly sized pieces and start spackling our corn husks with tamalei dough. Just spread a nice, relatively thin, even layer over the top half of the corn husk, leaving a 2-in border on each side. Stuff with your fillings and roll together so that the two sides of the tamalei dough meet in the middle. Fold up the tapered end of the corn husk and using two strips of corn husks that we're going to tie together in the center, we're going to make a little tie for tamale security. Snip the long strands for a prettier presentation. And look at that perfect little package. It takes a bit of practice, but you find yourself getting into a rhythm and it becomes second nature after your fourth or fifth try. Repeat with some of the pork and place them all standing up in the steam basket of a large pot. Cover the tops of the tamales with a couple stray corn husks. This is going to help concentrate the heat in the steamer, fill with an inch or two of water. Cover and steam for about 90 minutes. If you find that the interior of your tamales are sticking to the corn husks, just steam them for another 15 minutes. Stack them up on a large plate so they stay warm, but let them rest for 30 minutes before digging in. This is going to help them firm up a little bit. And now, a solid 8 hours of work later, it's time to finally dig in. I'm going to have one of each. We've got pablano and cheese and pork stuffed tamali, but you could really put anything you want in here. Anything you would put in a taco, I bet would work in here. I'm going to serve them with a slightly spicy, sharp, acidic salsa verde. You can check out my I love you man tacos episode for how to make that. And guess what, guys? We've got another clean plate award winner. These things can be prepped in advance. They freeze great after you've cooked them. And they're perfect for your Oscar viewing party. That is if you don't eat them all yourself. You are perfect just like this. You're just as special as anyone else in this family. Mhm. You just healed my hand with aneso. I healed your hand with my love for my daughter. Hey, what's up guys? Welcome back to Binging with Babish, where this week I need a quick and easy one. So, we're making arrapases from Encanto. Now, to make aripas, you need a special kind of corn flour, which for some reason when I was shooting this, I thought it'd be a good idea to illustrate. I don't know why you need to know that. We're using Masaripa, a kind of pre-cooked corn flour readily available at your local groceryer. First up, in a large bowl, we are combining 10 ounces of warm water, 1 teaspoon of kosher salt, and 10 ounces of masarapa, adding in stages and mixing constantly with your hands to make sure that it doesn't end up dry or lumpy. Once you got yourself a relatively smooth paste, we're going to let that sit for 10 minutes. After which time, the corn flour should have hydrated and it'll look uh exactly the same. But now we can start paying attention to its texture. We want it to be able to hold together, but still be a little crumbly. If that's where it's at, we're going to add 1 oz of soft unsalted butter and 2 and 12 oz of shredded wajaka or low moisture mozzarella cheese. Then we got to knead this guy together for about 5 minutes. Since there is no gluten to develop in corn flour, I don't really know exactly what's happening here, but you should find that the dough comes together into one smeary, cohesive, not too sticky ball. Adjust with more water or mozzarella as necessary until you end up with a texture that looks like this. And now it's time to form it into little corn burgers. Using thoroughly moistened hands, we're going to divide this dough into eight equal pieces or six if you want larger oras. You can arrange these on parchment paper or just throw them down on the griddle. This is my first time making, so I'm being way too fastidious and precious about it. For some reason, I thought it'd be a good idea to lay them out in parchment paper that I would then cut for easy transport over the skillet, none of which is necessary. Over on the stove top, we've got a cast iron skillet that's been preheated over medium to medium low heat, which we're going to plop our arapas onto after we've brushed it down with melted butter or the fat of your choice. Cooking for about 5 to 7 minutes per side over medium low heat. These things are thick and we want them to cook through and develop a nice golden brown crust. Once cooked, scoop them off. And then it's time to slice and stuff. We're going to cut the orapas about 2/3 of the way open. Once again, this is my first time doing this. Look at that little guy just exploring his universe. And once split open, we're going to stuff them with cheese. Once again, you can use wajaka. I'm just using slices of low moisture mozzarella. Then these guys are headed back onto the skillet where they're going to cook for 2 to 3 minutes per side over medium low heat until the cheese is melted through. And all you want to do in this world is eat them. Plate them up and serve them just as they are, maybe with a little sprinkle of kosher salt. Now, you don't have to slowly tear them in half, but I'm a YouTuber. It's in my contract. Then all there is left to do is dig into your delicious, crunchy, cheesy, corny snack. There's only one word for it. Incantora. Get your clothes on. Get ready. Got breakfast for you. Look, you get porridge. And it's happy to see you. Hey, get out of there. Hey, what's up, guys? Welcome back to Binging with Babish, where this week we're taking a look at the congi from Mulan. A simple porridge made from that most abundant of food stuffs, rice. I'm sorry for the relatively simple recipe this week, but despite having a lot of fun meeting you guys at VidCon, it pushed my production schedule into the day before you're watching this very episode. But I still think we can have fun with this recipe. Let's start by making a barebones congi. That is a ratio of 6:1 cups water to rice. So that's 6 cups of water to 1 cup of long grain jasmine rice that we're going to bring to a bare simmer, partially cover, and cook for 1 and 1/2 hours until the rice has totally broken down and become a thick creamy porridge. Now, during the cooking process, you may notice that the water evaporates too quickly. If so, add more water a cup at a time until the desired consistency is reached. It should look like, well, porridge. And while its viscosity is entirely up to your preference, do not eat this without seasoning heavily with salt and pepper. Now, it's time for the smiley face bacon, which I attempted to cook in the shape of a smile. But, as you can see, they just sort of naturally straighten out as they cook. But when you take them off the heat and let them cool on a paper towel, this is when you can shape them to the appropriate specification. And while the bacon drains, it's time to address eggs. Now, Mushu is a very small guy, and he's serving the congi in a very small bowl. So, I think this means quail's eggs, which have a very thick inner membrane, so they can be a little tricky to crack. Just pierce them with a knife and carefully crack them open into your awaiting skillet filled with bacon fat. Simply cook them sunny side up until the whites are set and the yolks are still runny. And then it's time for presentation. Let's start with a generous helping of our kongi. In this, its most basic form, perhaps the blandest food stuff known to man. So, it's a good thing we've got a few bacon fat fried eggs and some bacon. And look at that. Your breakfast is smiling at you. I have to admit, I'm charmed. In fact, this little guy is just so cute. I don't know if I can bring myself to eat. Ah, no. I'm going to eat them. I'm going to eat his old face. And while, of course, the bacon and eggs are nice once they're done. This is a really, really bland porridge. So, we need to go back to our building blocks to make something a little bit more exciting. And we're also going to see if we can drastically cut down on our cook time by employing the use of a pressure cooker. We're going to keep the same liquid to rice ratio of six to1, but this time we're going to use homemade chicken stock. Alternately, you could just add some chicken parts to the pressure cooker as it cooks, and you get some nice shredded chicken in the end. I'm also going to add a 1-in knob of ginger, finely chopped, and one clove of garlic, finely chopped. As usual, do not season until the end of cooking. Put this guy on high pressure for 30 minutes. Quick releasing the pressure and generously seasoning with salt and pepper. And now it's time to start focusing on additional kongji autra. What? Sorry. We're frying some thinly sliced garlic and thinly sliced shallots in a little bit of vegetable oil and draining on paper towels. Slicing up some green onion and bringing a couple other new friends to the party. As you can see, the chicken stock made for a darker brown congi. If you don't want to do that, add the chicken parts as I described earlier. Or you can make a lighter colored stock by not frying your chicken parts before simmering. We got a bigger bowl and that calls for bigger eggs. I've got two Sunny Side Up eggs here. And we need a bigger bacon smile. And since they don't really make bacon much bigger, let's just double up. And now, how about some sauteed shiakei mushroom eyebrows? That's both cute and delicious. But before he gets too cute, let's give him a little scallion beard, which to me sounds like it could be a pirate antagonist from Candyland or something. Then how about some black sesame seed pupils? That's sure to make it more realistic and a little creepy. Some pickled ginger ears for further anatomical correctness. And some curly crispy shallot hair. What else does this guy need? Uh, how about a how about a nose? Let's do a crispy fried garlic chip nose since that's probably the smelliest ingredient. And then peanut uh peanut um uh peanut I don't know. The guy's got peanuts in his beard. Few dots of delicious Sriracha acne. And that's just about as many facial features as we can give this thing. I got to admit, he's pretty cute. And I have much higher hopes for how good he's going to taste. I know that Mushu uses chopsticks in the movie, but I'm going to opt for a spoon because kongji is not very chopstick friendly. And as predicted, this is pretty frigin delicious. It's a flavorful and anthropomorphic breakfast that I can really get behind. And he would definitely join the clean play club if he wasn't so darn cute. I think I'm gonna call him John Bon [Music] Kong. Hey, what's up guys? Welcome back to Binging with Babish, where this week we're taking a look at Remy's soup from Ratatouille, which by most metrics appears to be a potato leak soup. I think Pixar took some culinary liberties in depicting the recipe. So, we're going to do what we do best here on Babish, make a super basic version, and then like Remy, see in what ways we can improve it. First, we have to trim and clean our leaks. That means removing the roots and cutting the leak at the point where the white begins to turn to green. Then, the white segments are being hald lengthwise and thoroughly washed. Leaks being notorious for hiding dirt in every crevice. Submerge in some water and flip through the layers like a book to make sure that no errant granules of earth are left behind. Then we want to pat these guys dry before beginning to slice into very very thin slices. Leaks are of a tough and fibrous sort. And if you're not pureeing your soup can turn into little edible zip ties. I'm doing two recipes, so I'm going to divvy these up in two. It's about three leaks per recipe. And starting work on the other half of this self-titled album, the potato. Three large russetss peeled and chopped into 1/2-in pieces. Keep these guys covered in cold water to wash off excess starch and prevent oxidation. Everybody's prepped, so it's time to cook. And we're starting with the very simplest iteration of potato leak soup, vishi schwaz. Melting 2 tablespoons of butter in a wide highwalled skillet. Wait for the foaming to subside. And then we're adding our three leaks worth of thinly sliced bottoms. Sautéing over medium heat for 3 to 5 minutes until sweated and beginning to soften. Hopefully you got a little bit of brown stuff forming on the bottom of the pot, which we're going to delaze with one liter or 4.22 cups of vegetable stock. Bring this guy up to a simmer before adding our potatoes. Three russetss worth between 5 to 600 g. Then here they shall cook with the stock and leaks for about 15 minutes until completely softened and effortly pierced by a pairing knife or human teeth. Now to be more movie accurate, you could serve the soup like this, rustic with whole chunks of vegetables in it. But to make it a fishy swaz, it must be pureed. You could do this in the pan, but that's not very smart, Andy. Let's put it in a thing. Something tall, narrow, and heat proof. Season to taste with kosher salt and make sure that everything is entirely smooth. Then finally, we're adding a/2 cup of heavy cream. Now, you might be wondering why I'm using a whisk instead of the hand blender to incorporate the cream. And I'm wondering that, too. Guess you'd have to ask last week, Andy, and I don't get that guy. Be sure to taste for seasoning. And the soup can be served hot, but is traditionally served cold. So, cover it up tight and fridge it for at least 4 hours or until completely not hot. Pour it into a soup style bowl. Garnish with a little bit more heavy cream. Not my best work, but certainly not my worst. Garnish with chives for color and chess. And season with a little bit of freshly ground black pepper. And there you have it, a classic fishy swaz. Reportedly Julia Child's very favorite soup. So how's it taste? And the answer is very, very good, but very, very simple. As though licked off the page of the definition of potato leak soup. Certainly not as bad as linguini. But what would Remy the rat do? First up, I think make good use of these leak greens in a homemade vegetable stock. Cutting all these guys in half and very extremely thoroughly washing them as the greens tend to be even dirtier. I'm going to chop these up into some slightly more manageable pieces so they fit in my pan and give them plenty of company in the form of several essential aromatics. Of course, there's celery, and this is a great opportunity to put those celery leaves to good use. Make sure you wash those, too, before you add them to the pan. And carrots are a given, but I like to also add a parsnip's worth of parsnip to my stock. I found that it adds a distinct sweetness. And despite all the oniony leaks in there, we're going to add one onion quartered, some fresh thyme, fresh parsley, a little bit of fresh rosemary, and a hefty finger full of bay leaves. Something I definitely saw Remy throw in the pot. I'm also going to add some hald garlic cloves. I got these giant ones. Covering everybody with cold water, popping a lid on top and bringing to a simmer. Then partially covering and holding for at least 2 hours up to four. After that point, there's not much more flavor to be gotten out of these vegetables. You could snack on them if you want, but they're really better as compost. Simply strain out the solids. And we're only going to need a liter of this vegetable stock, so make sure you freeze and save the rest. Next up, another ingredient added by Remy, garlic. But instead of just throwing whole cloves in the pot, we're going to cut the tops off two heads of garlic. Wrap in a little bit of foil. Drizzle with olive oil. Sprinkle with salt. Twist the aluminum foil tightly around the garlic and place in a 400° Fahrenheit oven for 35 to 45 minutes until you can plainly smell the greatness lying in weight. Retrieve from the oven without oven gloves so you look like a tough guy. Unwrap and behold. Now, you might be thinking, two whole heads of garlic for soup is a lot, and you're right. That's why one of these is just a snack for me. Over on the stove top, we're starting out the same way. But I want to try and caramelize these leaks. You can't really caramelize leaks the same way that you can onions, but I'm just going to keep them moving low and slow for as long as I possibly can until they've got some good color. Next door, you might be wondering why I'm bringing my potatoes to a boil in plain salted water instead of stock. Once again, I'm going to ask you to direct all your questions to last week Andy. I seriously don't know what he's doing sometimes. It's like he has zero hindsight. Once the leaks can't caramelize no more without browning, I'm delazing with one cup of dry white wine, simmering over medium heat until the onions are soft and jammy and the wine has all but evaporated. This should also leave some delicious fond on the bottom of the pot that we can then delaze with our homemade vegetable stock. Make sure you scrape up all that good stuff, adding one liter of stock to the pot. Then once the potatoes are nice and tender, I'm going to drain them. Then I'm going to start by only adding half the potatoes to the soup. That's because I'm going to use some to thicken the soup and the rest to give it a chunky texture like in the movie. Squeeze that head of roasted garlic in there and simmer for about 5 minutes just to let the flavors get to know each other. But they're all about to get very well acquainted in the blender, which I'm going to blitz for about 30 seconds on max speed to ensure that all the vegetables are liquefied. Now, here's where you need to start making adjustments. The soup is way too thin, so I'm going to pour some of it out. And add a scoop or two more potatoes to thicken its body before it thickens my body. And keep adjusting as necessary, making sure to season to taste with kosher salt. And I'm going to add a/ teaspoon of white pepper so we don't end up with speckly soup. Now that it's nice and thick, but not gunky, I'm going to return it to the pan. Then, like a rat in a fine French kitchen, start adding stuff. First, the remaining potatoes so that the soup has a nice chunky vibe to it. An entire cup or 236 milllers of heavy cream. And for a little added tang, I'm going to add 2 oz or about 50 gram of cork, which if you can't find, you could just use gourmet or cream cheese. Scoop into an awaiting pre-warmed bowl if you want to be a pro about it. Garnish once again with chives and freshly ground black pepper. And since there's so much cream already in the soup, I'm going to drizzle it with a little bit of extra virgin olive oil. since you can see some beads of fat dancing across the surface of the soup in the movie. But how's it taste? And the answer is really, really good. It's everything that makes the fishy swas great with added flavor and complexity. I think I would have loved a little freshly grated nutmeg over top, but once again," last week Andy dropped the ball. Still an unquestionable member of the clean plate/bowl [Music] club. Heat. Heat.

Why? One word, Bies. Bies is both the world's biggest gas station the size of a football field and it's apparently a wonderful place to work with fair and equitable wages. Starting wage for a warehouse and grocery stalker, $18 an hour. What is the minimum wage nowadays? 725. Still at 725. This is a Texas-based company that starts its wages at $18 an hour. And once you start getting a manager position, we're looking at a h1red to $225,000 a year. No experience necessary. This is an American dream. And apparently the quality of all their stuff is supposed to be through the roof. Why doesn't everybody conduct their business this way? I don't know anything about businesses. So I'm here to tell you that this is how it should be done. We're going to go there and we're going to rank all their most popular snacks, drinks, and others. All that stands between us and BIES is a 1hour road trip. Let's see if I and the others in this vehicle psychologically survive the experience. GIS. Andy, I thought I asked you to be quiet. Penis.

You have Nintendo Switch at home. I want the new one. Douglas R. Hey, this episode is brought to you by Squarespace. They've supported this channel for over 7 years.

Well, that is the size of a football field. Cajun crackers, what you call me? I've never had dill pork rinds before. We got to do pickled quail eggs. As I understand, the most popular snack from Bies is the Bucky nuggets. Bies nuggets. Beaver nuggets. I'll get it right. Beaver nuggets, which kind of sounds like a an antandra of sorts. They look like u some kind of corn puff or something. What are these made of? Brown sugar cornmeal. First ingredient is sugar. I've never seen that before, except in candy. I love that it's brown sugar. That's cool. It's not like, you know, hydrogenated corn chemicals. There's more brown sugar in this than there is corn. Oh god, that's good. Very molassesy. Very corny. Like this tastes like what you wanted breakfast cereal to taste like when you were a kid. And Captain Crunch tastes like vegetables compared to this. They have a 4-in thick shell of candy on them. They're they're mostly c. It's no wonder it's the first ingredient. Jesus. I'm going to give that a uh give it a nine. These are incredible. Now, we got the Bies Nuggies, which seem to be the savory version of the Beaver Nuggets. All right. They look like uh Pirates Booty. That's what they look like. So, those are Pirates Booty with four times the powder on them. Way more flavorful than Pirates Booty is, but at a cost. I think all that powder, they're not as crunchy. They almost feel like moist, which not great. Very dead center of them has a bit of crunch to it, but like feel damp in the mouth. They have a damp mouth feel. I'd rather have a pirates booty. Honestly, I'd rather be eating a pirates booty. I'd eat these. I would absolutely snack on these, but I would res maybe resent it a little bit. I'm going to give these give them a five. Chey puffs. Original. I don't know about that. This feels like a uh bit of a Yeah, these are just Cheetos. Those are just puffy Cheetos. Yeah, these don't taste as good as the as Cheetos Cheetos. They I don't know, something about them. They taste a little cornier or something. Also suffering from the same dampness as their pirates booty. I'm not crazy about these. I'm going to give these a four. Bucko's. These are sweet onion buckos. There's some some barbed wire happening on there. I don't know why that's there. I can see why I keep my barbwire. These are valuable and the texture is amazing. They're really light and airy and crisp. They almost have the texture of a pork rind. They just disappear in the mouth. They're there one second gone the next go. The flavor for some reason was a little lacking to me, but the texture is awesome. I'll give these a seven. Speaking of pork rinds, pork rind, specifically dill flavored pork rind. Not a thing that I have heard of in my 37 summers. Smells like dill. Ooh. Oh. Ooh. I don't know. No. They finished funny in that pork way. This tastes like a a pig's skin. This tastes like it was ripped from its back and it was still dirty and they were like, ""Put it in the fryer and dust it with the dill."" And they're really dry. I I like it when pork rinds are exploding with fat and they end up almost being greasy in the mouth. And these are really dry. Dill flavor is nice until this very funky pork flavor hits you on the back end. Not a fan of that at all. I'm going to give these a three. Don't like these at all. Speaking of dill pork rinds, how about dill dill chips? Huh? All right. I love dill chips. So you got to stick the landing on this one, boy. So crunchy. Are we there yet? Those are the crunchiest chips I've ever had in my 37 summers. They're so crunchy. They're all fold overs, too. This is like my These are my kind of freaking chips. Most of them are fold overs. What a miracle. Oh, they do look pretty thick, actually now that I'm looking at them. But the way they crunch, you'd think that they were a/4 inch thick. They're they're they're But the dill flavors right there, they taste like pickles. They crunch like a champion. And they eat like a damn fine chip. I'm going to give these one of the best chips I think I've had. I love the texture of them. I'm going to give them a nine. Love them. The beverage, which in this case is a pineapple cream soda, which sounds pretty good. So, let's see what this is like. God, that's horrible. That tastes like a pina colada glade plugin. That tastes like an air freshener. That's awful. God. Oh, okay. It's better on second sip. The first sip was abrasive. Like that that was that was fighting me. Second one is just like, okay, I'm getting used to this. Third sip's delicious. No, I'm kidding. I'm gonna give it a a three. The pineapple flavor, it's it tastes like vape juice. It's It's terrible. Cajun crackers. So, these look like oyster crackers. They're great for [Applause] snacking. Whoa. God, everything's so bold here. Textures, flavors, making me feel alive. God, these look flavor dusted as Oh, look at how orange and Cajun those look. Wow, they look like goldfish. If goldfish fought in the MMA, you could hold my entire family hostage and say, ""These are Cajun flavored."" And I would say, ""No, they're spicy pizza flavored."" And then he'd kill my whole family. And I would say, ""I At least I didn't lie. They taste like pizza combos but spicy and crackers. Well, they're good and spicy, too. They're properly, you know, they're like eating a medium buffalo wing. These are not these are showing up. Whatever. No, I'm going to give these an eight. They're quite good. I would snack on these pretty prolifically. Next up, we have hot little tube of pecans. And look, I am from York, new home of the hot sweet nut. Okay, Nuts for Nuts is the name of the the thing on the street where you buy the hot nuts and they're the best in the freaking world. So, you better come correct when if you if you come at the King, you best not miss. Oo, those do look good. Nice and warm. Oh, they smell like a Cinnabon. If these taste like a cinnabon, game over. I'm burning this van to the ground. Are they nuts for nuts good? Yeah, I'd say very much on par. If anything, they have a little bit more candy shell on them. They're less crisp. It's nicely spiced. There's good warming spices, cinnamon in there. I could eat these all day. I will say this, I wish they were saltier. They had a just a modum more sodium in there. I'd be dancing on the roof of this van while it's burning. So, for that reason alone, and because they're a little soft, actually, I'm going to give them an eight. They're still fantastic, and I could eat them all day. Speaking of cinnamon, here's the here here's cinnamon flavored yogurt pretzels. something I've not heard of before. So, they had all manner of different yogurt pretzels in there, but these are cinnamon flavored. Not something I've ever even dreamt of before. The cinnamon hit me at first and continues to. It must be an artificial cinnamon flavor, but I like it. I like hot tamales. I I've never once in my life bought them. I've only ever eaten them because they're there or because I got them at Halloween or something. I wonder if anybody has ever bought hot tamales. It's a very aggressive cinnamon flavor, but that being said, it plays nice with the the the richness of the yogurt um coating and the salty crunch of the pretzel. It's nice. I again, I'd rather have any of the other flavors on that wall. With that in mind, I'll give them a seven. They're good. All right, we got chili lime peanuts. They look and smell insane. They look bananas. It's the brightest red. I I'm sure that like the rods and cones in my eyes cannot perceive the wavelengths of red that are coming off this. If we had a mantis shrimp in here, it would be screaming in pain from the sheer color that's happening. Glad you like the mantis shrimp joke. I do. Ah. Oh, why put it on peanuts? Why not just like coagulate this this powder into gobs that you eat? Not bad, though. Like it's they're good. They're they're insane looking and tasting. Ah, it's I'm I'm I have a I have a very complicated relationship with these peanuts. And I think that gets you a five. Five for chili lime peanuts. No trip to the gas station is complete without some really smelly jerky. You know, when somebody opens it in the car and everybody can immediately tell. Let's find out if this stuff fits the bill. Whoa. Already the seal's not even open. I can smell it. I'm going to let that reach you. Like that's going to reach you. I promise. That smells like somebody else's burp. Don't bring this on a plane. What about a Toyota Sienna? They call it the plane of the road. Tastes very garlicky, don't get me wrong, but it's not as garlicky as the smell. And it's really tough. Um, not in a dry way. It's just very thick. 9 10 11 12 12 chews before my teeth met one another. Bookies beef jerky is a little taste of country. I'm going to just read this with the jerky in my mouth so it sounds like I'm dipping. I'll push it down under my lip. Some even say it's world famous. Made from solid strips of beef and smoked in Texas. It is a memory of home while you're out on the road. Even though Bies are only available in three states immediately surrounding and including Texas. That's good. As far as jerky goes, that's good. Smells insane. I'm going to give it a an eight. It's very, very good. Boy, I'm really fogging up this window here. Are we shooting an episode or are there teens exploring each other's bodies back here? Triple Mix. This is the mixture of their caramel kettle and cheddar corn. Let's see if it holds up to Nuts on Clark. Let me start with kettle just cuz that's going to be the most mild. We'll do two kernels of each. Kettle corn is [ __ ] The caramel corn is quite good. Nice thick candy shell. Tastes like fake caramel. Tastes like popcorn. The The reason that you get Nuts on Clark, I don't know why it's called that, but it is. The reason you get Nuts on Clark is because it's freshly made, freshly bagged. Anytime you buy this stuff prepackaged, you end up the ch the cheddar corn gets really mushy. And the kettle corn is the same. They've both absorbed moisture. They've acted as moisture desicant packets basically for the caramel corn. Not great textures. knocking around in here. Decent flavors. Bad kettle corn. Yeah, I'm gonna give this a four. Not really hitting the mark. Next up, pickled quail eggs. They had a number of pickled things and this was the wackiest. Oh boy. They feel firm. They feel quite firm. They feel very firm. Oh. Hey. Hey. Hey. Easy little guy. It's okay. I'm not going to hurt [Music] you. Wow. The pickling brine must be pure vinegar because they're so sour. Those were really, really, really bouncy, slippery, nasty. Oh, there's a wet dog aftertaste. Distinct wet dog aftertaste. I don't want my egg to taste like that. Nothing tastes quite like a wet dog. And that's what those taste like. That's awful. I'm going to give it a one. I'm going give a zero. I hate it. Hate it. Zero. Zero. Zero. Put it in the fire in the flames. Next up, Bies is firing a shot across the bow of that other company that does pickles in a bag like this. Let's see. These ones are candied flavored. That's a little dumb. Looks to be a bag of pickles. These were chilled. It tastes like a normal ass pickle. What's an ass pickle? I'll let you guess what makes a pickle an ass pickle bread. They're not sweet enough even though they have plenty of sugar in here. Uh, and they taste like just a not even a dill pickle. They have like no personality to them. I mean, they're not bad. They're just very, very plain. I'll give them a five cuz they're just they're just boring. You know what it is, folks. It's a hot hat round. It's a hat hot round. I'm wearing a hat and doing it hot cuz we're having hot hat round. Hot hat round hot. Okay, this is apparently the hot the hot stuff. First up, beaver chips. These are Buckes. Um, I'm I'm just realizing now that this place has the same name as my cat, spelled different, but now I miss my cat. Some B. Yeah, I'm not in the mood to do this anymore. I'm sad. Next up, we have Bies Beaver Chips. This is their housemade kettle chip. They look incredibly bubbly and fresh and crisp. Uh, I have high hopes just looking at these. It's the best chipped potato I've ever had in my life. Ten, they're perfect. They're perfect. They're so crisp. They're lightly warm. I've never had warm potato chips in my life. And I've made potato chips. By the time I got my mouth onto them, they were cooled. This guy's a quadruple fold over. You guys might not You might want to avert your eyes right now. It's not often that I close my eyes in pleasure. Very rare, but you just watch. You're the pervert. These taste like potatoes. They were most certainly I mean we I know they're fried and they make them right there. So, but they taste like they were fried in there because they were I don't need to say that they taste like they were. They taste as though they are what they are. 10. the best potato chips I've ever had. Next up, a reminder of my inadequacies as a man. I mean, a perfect representation of the hog of mine. Against all odds, we have sausage on a stick with tortilla. How do you get this open? Like a raccoon. You're like terrible. The [ __ ] Why is there a tortilla on it? Why is that there? Looks like a good tortilla. How is it glued on? How's it adhered? Why is it coming off like it it's it it wasn't even it just comes right off. But it's when you once you put it on, it stays on like Well, it was it was staying on like it was glued. Huh. I guess so. You can hold it. But then what do you need the stick for? No, no, no. You should eat on a stick. So you can So you can double grip it. You can really make sure that it's going in the right place. You got to make sure that it's going in the right place. Ready? You just have to align the back end a little bit. Okay. Right. Okay. I'll do it fast so you don't get any ideas. That's a pretty yummy garlicky summer sausage. Oh, what was it called in the mall? The uh Hickory Farms. Yes. Yeah, this tastes like a hickory farms little bit of sausage. Um, but I don't have a knife, so I'm going to have to use my mouth as a knife. Why is there a tortilla on this? I couldn't taste it at all. And I'd so much rather just have a big old honking sausage on a stick that I'm just like, look at my sausage on stick. Look at how I can balance it. Look at its rigidity. And instead, I've got this tortilla around here that provides no flavor. Let me try a little bit of the tortilla on its own. But it was made in the Buckyy's tortilla factory. It's a good tortilla. It has a nice, you know, flavor. And well, it tastes like sausage. I'm confused by it, but I celebrate it. And um I like holding it. I sure do like holding it. Makes me feel powerful. Yeah, I know. to hold it by the stick is pretty unwieldy. But when I hold it like this, I'm in control. I can just a tortilla handle, I think. Yeah. I know. And and God bless it for being there. Honestly, I've come full 180 on this tortilla and sausage. And I'm going to give it I'm going to give it an eight. It's delicious. And it's got this putting me in control. And it's got this tortilla around it. And it's healthy, too. So, eight. I like it. Weird, but I like it. Next up, we have an incredible collaboration between three great cultures. We have a Texas cheese steak burrito. Is it brisket? I mean, one hopes that'd be cool. Oh, there's a Look at the amount of ingredients on here. It just keeps going. Okay. 995 calories per What the 990? Look at the size of this. This should not be 1,000 calories in this something that doesn't even it's not even the length of my hand. It's insane. I bet it's going to be really good. Like honestly, is my whole life about to change? Yeah, it's pretty good. It's laden with queso. There's a ton of cheese sauce in there. And there's a ton of what I assume is extremely fatty, lowquality beef. I call him like like I eat some. It's no surprise that this is a thousand calories. Look at the sheer amount of goo in this. It's mostly goo. It's a little too gooey. I wish it was a little bit less gooey. Honestly, that their tortillas are fantastic. They have a nice chew to them. Really great neutral flavor. And there's no soggginess here whatsoever. I could see myself housing one of these if I were if I were drunk. I could eat two of these. I could eat 2,000 calories in a sitting laughing naked smoking a cigarette. Sounds like a grade nine. Yeah. And honestly, what are you guys doing tonight? The beef is like a little chewy and dry because it's stacums. I'm sure it's just like those, you know, crappy frozen beef. Whatever. So, that's the only thing not really going for it. And it's a little bit too gooey. Uh, but I'm I'm still I'm going to I'm going to give it a I'm going give it an eight. It's got to be the best ready to go burrito that I've ever had. Next up, the three meat sandwich. They have all different kinds of great barbecue in there. And we went with the three meat because well, sausage, brisket, and turkey. Oh god. Good. Oh, I am going to use my tray for this one, [Applause] boys. It's obscene. Turkey might as well not be there. I don't taste it at all. Makes it healthy. Makes it healthy. It's great. Sure. It's really quite good, but it's also insane. You don't need that much meat. What What's the calorie count on this mother? Let's see. What's the How is 900? How is this 100 calories less than the burrito? Look at the size of it. The amount of meat. It weighs twice as much. I'm making a mess. Uh-oh. This is a rental. They also told me when I picked up the van not to eat in it. So, you probably didn't tell them that. That's all we're doing. This is probably the the meanest thing we've ever done for content creation. Like we we make very good naturatured content and try not to do it at the expense of others. But we're eating the messiest, crummiest [ __ ] food. Amelia is both an incredible producer and mom. The sauce is like a very good bottled sauce, like a stubs. The meats are all quite moist. Uh, I'm not crazy about having the sausage on there because the sausage kind of like it's you really got to bite through it so it slips off. Not a fan of that. All that to be said, as far as barbecue sandwiches go, it's pretty solid. Like, if I got this at a, you know, state fair or something, I'd be like, this is good barbecue that I just got at this state fair. The bread is not soggy and messy and awful. It's got a nice chew to it. It's a great potato roll, I think. Yeah. Overall, a really solid sandwich. some shortcomings, but for something that I just got off, you know, readymade on a rack, unbelievable. I'll give it a seven. It's really very good. I like it. Next up, we have chicken and fries along with their tender chicken sauce. Is it for tender chicken or chicken? Why I'm making the face that I'm making, Bradley. 97. There are fewer calories in this box of chicken and fries than in that tiny little burrito. I got to open up my tender chicken sauce. I'm willing to bet this is going to be, you know, your your kind of Chick-fil-A sort of special sauce. Looks like honey mustard with some stuff in it. Okay. Oo. Okay. As far as special sauces go, that's quite good. Like that's that's one of the better special sauces I think I've I think that might be my favorite special sauce I've ever had. It's definitely more honey mustard than anything else. I think that's why I like it so much. It's like they took honey mustard and they added maybe like pimentos or something. I see little flexcks of red in there. And we're in the south. Some pepper, some maybe a little bit of ketchup. That's fantastic. I love that. And mayonnaise, of course. Obviously, these fries look like they've been uh sometimes restaurants will will uh lightly batter or coat their fries in cornstarch to get this kind of like rustic appearance. That's a good fry. All right, let's try it on its own first. Chicken is perfectly moist, pretty flavorless. The crust is nice and crisp, and it's not over crusty and under chickeny. They're very high quality. They're higher quality than you're going to get at Applebee's. Applebee's chicken tenders have fallen off the face of a cliff. They suck now. They're better than ballpark chicken tenders. They're better than movie theater chicken tenders. They're better than the chicken tenders you get at the opera. I'll have your finest chicken tenders, sir. Oh, right away. Right away, master. That being said, they're they're a little boring. They're they're they're not like super moist. They're just not dry. They're right in the middle. I mean, you get a [ __ ] ton of fries with these, too. Like, there's mostly fries. Why did the chicken cross the road? To get a bug. Overall, a top tier chicken finger experience. Hell of a lot better than you're going to get out of your freezer. How much do they cost? $8.99. It's a hell of a deal. Only at Bies. It's a top tier chicken finger experience. Better than you're going to get out of the freezer. Better than you're going to get from most fast food restaurants. I think an eight. They're really good. They're chicken tenders. I'm going to grade this separately cuz I'm blown away by I love it so much. I'm going to give it a 10. And I'm gonna skate it around a little bit in a game of chicken against this car that we're not supposed to be eating in. Who's who will yield first? Me or the [Music] car. All right, time for some sweets. Sweets round. Apparently very famous for their gummy bears. These feel soft. And God. Oh my god, that smells awful. I mean, all right. My favorite flavor of gummy bear universally is what? I like a really stale gummy bear. Like a really chewy. I have to fight it. I like the jerky of gummy bears. So, I don't know if this is gonna be up my alley, but that's a really nice texture. Uh, better than the Haribo for sure. Haribo almost has like a It's almost like jell-o in comparison to these. Like your teeth slip right through Harry unless you stale them. Once you stale them, they're good. But these are good right out of the bag. I'm going to try this light blue one. I've never seen a light cuz they have they have dark blue and light blue gummy bears. These have yellow five in them. That's the one that gives you dick stuff, right? We can only hope. Straight out of the package, really solid gummy bear. I'm going to give these I'm going give this a seven. They're really good. Next up, we have the Bies Beaver Freezers blueberry cheesecake gourmet frozen treats. Let's see what the freaking deal is. Looks good. That tip was mostly blueberry. So, I'm gonna try a little bit of this. Like, wow. That is not just blue food coloring. Totally different texture from the cheesecake part. It's like there's just blueberry jam mixed in there. It is 42 degrees out and I would still eat more of this. If I didn't already, I kind of want to die cuz I'm eating a lot of weird and I'm not done. So, I'm going to give it an eight. I really like this. Last up in the ice cream category, we have a sugar cookie ice cream sandwich um with salted caramel ice cream. I think the big undoing here mo with most ice cream sandwiches is the cookie because if you make a really good cookie, chances are it's going to be hard as a rock. The other side of that spectrum is the classic ice cream sandwich cookie, whatever that is, which most of it comes off on your fingers. Like it literally just it peels off in the shape of your fingers. Whatever touches it, it's just like here here you go. So let's see if they stick the landing. That is some really I don't know uncanny valley kind of ice cream. That ice cream doesn't look real. So smooth. Let's see what's going on here. Oh, okay. But that cookie is soft as a fresh room temperature cookie. I went right through it. Has a decent chew to it, which a sugar cookie should. And the ice cream is super fluffed. it's been like like airrated or something so that it's really really light and tender. As far as eaten experiences go, this is one of the best ice cream sandwiches I've ever had in terms of its form factor. The flavor is not quite there. It tastes like the flavor pump of caramel that you get with the flavor pump. A little bit of a let down in terms of flavor, but I would house this entire thing. They also had other flavors in there. I can't remember what, but they had other flavors. So, give it an eight. This is really very very good. All right. Next up, we have a key lime pie cup that is as jiggly as my is long. I'm sorry. Sorry. I'm just trying to think of an absolute truth to compare it to. You know, uh key lime pie, which is jiggly as my dick is long. Flidians would have choice words for this cuz it's not supposed to do that. It's also bright green. I saw that scene in Dexter. I watched the first four seasons of Dexter and stopped after that just like everybody else. There's a whole thing that um character actress Margot Martindelle does about key lime pie when Dexter kills her and she's like so and so's is is uh jello pudding with green food coloring. She's dying and uh that's what I think we what's happening here. Back to work. quite tart and extremely fake tasting. Key limes are oddly sweet. That's why you use them to make key lime pie. Hard to emulate, but you could do better than this. You could I would probably eat more of this if it was the only sweet I had. I'm going to give it a three. Doesn't taste real. This is cookie dough dash party time. Cookie dough- party time. Let's find out. It tastes like I opened up a tube of Nestle cut and bake cookie dough and just started munching on that, which I have absolutely done. So, they nailed that, but it's not good. Like, it's not good. I've eaten the raw um the chocolate chip cookie dough. I'll do that all day. But this this party time cookie dough, better better check your watch cuz I don't think it's party time. I'm I'm going to give it a four just cuz it's just gritty soft sugar. Next up, we have the Bies Overbite, which I was about to say this is heavy as hell. And then look down here. And I've never seen this on a chocolate bar before. A quarter pound of goodness. You could throw this at somebody. It would hurt. It's as heavy as a hockey puck. So dense and and and thick and shiny. And let's crack it in half, shall we? Oh my god. Oh Jesus. Wow. God. That is an exemplary peanut butter cup. Perhaps the best I've ever had uh commercially available because the chocolate is I mean if you can't tell from how shiny it is. It's super snappy. Like really welltempered. They have dark chocolate versions there and I opted not to get them because milk chocolate and peanut butter works best. So, the milk chocolate on its own tastes like pretty high quality, like American Cadbury or something. And then the peanut butter, this is key. The peanut butter has been sweetened, so it's nice and sweet the way you want it, but it's smooth. I have I don't I don't know. I don't think I've ever had a smooth core to a peanut butter cup that hasn't been homemade or bought from some fancy ass bakery. When you bite into Reese's, it's like powder almost inside. It's a It's a It's a disc of spiteful powder compressed into kind of a fudge. It's the best peanut butter cup I ever had. My favorite flavors in this world are chocolate and peanut butter. I think you might be able to guess what score this is getting. It's going to get a five. I'm kidding. 10. Bies overbite. Quarter pound of goodness. Okay, we got coconut peanut brittle. Sounds quite good. I've never had coconut in a peanut brittle medium. Looks like a good representative bite. Got two peanuts in there. That's That's fantastic. Not only is it like exemplary peanut brittle, you're not breaking your teeth on that. It's it's it's delicate. Homemade peanut brittle usually is hard as a rock and impossible to get your teeth through. This shatters with willingness and maintains its shape and its strength. On top of that, you get a flavor journey. At first, all you taste is peanut. Then, once that clears, you get coconut. So, like literally 2 seconds into chewing, you're your the flavor profile changes entirely. I'm gonna give it a nine. It's really good. I love it. Next up, beaver nuggets. Dark chocolate. I had to try these. You know, I had to try these, fam. Y'all knew as soon as I saw these, I'm gonna have to try these, fam. You know, we've taken our beloved beaver nuggets and upped the ante by covering them in rich dark chocolate obtained from sustainably sourced coconut beans. Cocoa beans, not coconut beans. I'm going coconut beans. Okay. I feel like they'd probably add more salt cuz it was nice and had a nice pop of salt to it. That amazing beaver nuggets texture. and you know kind of candy shell in the center plus the dark chocolate. I think this might work better with milk chocolate maybe. It's it's like it's like chocolate covered caramel corn which is one of the best objects to put in your mouth and it's just like that because these are corn uh puffs. So it's it's this you see do you see? So 10 chocolate covered beep nuggets. The pecan log. What's in the center of this? It's so girthy. I mean, it's, you know, perfectly average girthy. Above average girthy. It's familiar girthy. Talking about my toes. It feels I was going to say this is like filled with meringue or something, but it feels pretty pretty hefty. So, I don't know. I'm very curious to see what's going to be in here. Stop, Brad. Don't stop. Oh. Oh, it's nothing but nougats in the center. You know that filler that they put in candy bars? I mean, this might be a bad one, but this the these these nuts taste turned. Why would anybody want this? It's like eating a giant marshmallow covered in nuts. Like, what? It sounds like something that came from alt history 1950s America or something like Bioshock kind of timeline. I'm Andrew Ryan and every day I eat four of these for health and vitality. I'm going to give a one. I don't like anything about it. Paddle tail. This is a paddle tail. They trap beavers and snares, which are very cruel, and they chop off the tail and they deep fry it and they put icing on it and they sell it for $2.99. That",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks like a cinnamon roll that somebody sat on. I mean, you lose the sort of soft chewiness that you get at the center of a normal cinnamon bun, but you get more light, flaky, crispy, which is nice. I love a lot of frosting on I mean, don't we all? Don't you love a lot of frosting on a cinnamon roll bun? I think I speak for all of us when I say I like a lot of frosting. And there's not much frosting here. This is gestural frosting. I'm going to give it a an eight cuz it's still very, very good. Now, we have tiger butter fudge. Tiger butter fudge. And what they do to make this, they cut off the tiger's tail. They let it bleed out. Then in a separate room, they make fudge. It's vanilla chocolate with chocolate and peanut butter. This peanut butter and chocolate swirl on top. Cuz this is purely gestural. It's about a millimeter thick. You can see it's barely there. I can't believe that they killed the tire to make this. I mean, for that reason, I'm inclined to give it a lower score. Flavor-wise, I'm I do not like that vanilla chocolate. Like that is objectionable. It tastes not even like white chocolate. It just tastes like cocoa butter or something like it's neutral with with fake vanilla flavor or something like that. I'm going to give it a four because I don't want any more of it. Now, we have something with which I am fully un acquainted. Uh which is cosmic pops. I have no idea what this is. Cotton candy. Oh, I'm seeing this now. Pops in your mouth. If this is Pop Rocks but in clusters and with any kind of like texture or, you know, interesting flavor or something, I'm gonna have to change my clothes into something even more BES celebratory. Yeah, it smells like cotton candy. Okay, we got they look like uh I don't know. They look like that. I don't have to tell you something else that they kind of look like. Okay, folks. that is pop rocks that have been uh clustered together in white chocolate. I'm not a big fan of white chocolate, but it doesn't taste like white chocolate because it tastes like cotton candy. So, it's awesome. Pop rocks are just are just sugar that pops. That's it. Like, they're fun as a novelty for that reason alone. But you coat them in the white chocolate. Not only are the are they in these adorable little clusters, but also there's a creaminess. So, you're that's melting in your mouth while there's popping and crunching. It's a It's a textural wonderland. It's what John Mayer was talking about when he said your body was wonder. He was misspelled it. He was he meant to say your cosmic pops are a wonderland. And and he's he and he's he's got a half million dollar watch. That's good. I give it a 10. It's like not even because it's the best thing I've ever eaten. It's just so inventive and it's an improvement on pop rocks. And pop rocks are so much fun. And these are even more fun. but practical. I don't know why I'm giving it a 10. It's just because like it it awoke a child inside of me that has been dead and it just woke it up and it was like there's still new things to be had in this world, new experiences to try. Here you go. Thanks, Cosmic Pops. I want to see if I can get a full outfit. Everything. Why don't they have these in adult sizes? We got to do the Beaver Nugget candle. You know, flip it. [Music] They have a line of hot sauces, barbecue sauces, all kinds of stuff. We went for the hottest one, Carolina Reaper hot sauce. Fiery hot. Andrea, are you just about to drink from a bottle of hot sauce? No, Brad, I'm not going to do [Music] that. Oh, it's hot. And I've been on hot ones. I bet I'm not hot ones. Uh-oh. I'm spicy drunk. Oh no. What do I rate it? What? What? What? Why is my nose orange? [Music] Okay. No, we did it. We did the right thing. We're good. Right on time, Bucky. Okay. There we [Music] go. Uh, is it making it all better? No. This is the least dignified thing I've ever done in my entire life. Look at me, Brad. I used to be a respected broadcaster. I was on I was on the Drew Barrymore show. Ow. [ __ ] I shut I put I pushed it up my nose because it was on the tissue and I pushed it up. This is good. This is good content. This is what people want to see. Ow. Oh god, that hurts. Okay, what's next? No, we have to rate it. Oh yeah. Um 10. In all seriousness, folks, it had a really nice fruity flavor, almost like a habanero-like flavor. It would bring a tropical freshness to whatever you put it on or in. And it was very spicy per its name. Andrew, we've talked about this. Look at the people when you're talking to them. It's a little too vinegary. Doesn't work great in the nose. So, I'm going to give it a probably like a a seven. I think it's very good. Next up, Bies Nail Clippers. My nose burns so bad. What did they say about clipping your nails in the back of this car? Good clean cut. I don't know why they I guess to fit the logo on there that you have to make them big and dumb like this. It's a bottle opener. 10. It's a bottle opener. Just so when you're done clipping your nails, you can crack open that beer. If finally you done enough today cuz this looks like it's for children. Why is there a bottle opener on this? Is this for dads or for kids? I don't understand. For both? I guess you clip the kids nails. That's a mother. You need a a beer after that. I get it now. Perfect. A to B linear storytelling all in a nail clipper. There's a tiny tiny nail file built in right there. Wow. There's a tiny little nail file in there. I was joking when I said 10, but this is this is covering all different kinds of bases, nails, and bottles. But it looks dumb. So, like a nine. Chapstick. We got a smooth mint lip balm. And I legitimately just ran out of my preferred brand. Now, I should say before we go any further, I don't like anything, but my preferred brand of lip balm. So, I'm going to hate this. I'm going to do a legitimate gripe now, which is that it's like more spearmint than peppermint. And I hate spearmint personally. Feels real good on my mouth. That'll only get you so far. So, I'm going to give this a uh two. Next up, we have SPF 30 sunscreen. Protects against UVA and UVB rays. And it's made in the USA. Smells like cinnamon. Like cinnamon rolls. Am I crazy? Whose idea was it to make cinnamon sunscreen? Why wouldn't you say that? What the All right. Okay. It's pretty standard. Okay. That's insane. Cuz now it smells like sunscreen. It's in a concentrated form. Off of skin, it smells like cinnamon. Now that it's on me, it smells like sunscreen. That's wild. I'm going to give it a uh seven. It's just a solid sunscreen. Last up, the Bies Beaver Nuggets candle. Experience the sense of Bies in these fun, flavorfilled gourmet candles, including some of the classic treats that greet your senses as you walk in the stores. Bring the aroma of Bies home and fill your room with everything you crave on a long road trip. Oh yeah, that does smell like I smell it. It smells like it. Yeah. What' they say about burning candles in this car? Where did you get a lighter answer? At Bies. I bought it at Bies. That smells not so great because the the the Bucky balls or whatever they're called, the um beaver balls, the beaver nuts, the beaver testicles, the beaver nuggets, nuggets, beaver nuggets smell like fake caramel. And uh that's what this smells like. And personally, I would not want to fill my house with it. Per personally personally uh I don't much like it. Yeah. Reminds me of Yankee Candle. So I'm going to give this uh three. Well, guys, we had a lot of fun here today. And legitimately, we had a lot of fun. And I learned that I really love buggies. Maybe not enough where you would ever see me wearing this ever again. Okay, that's enough of that. a little bit more dignified. Thank you very much for watching. Please let me know what you'd like to see me rank next. What did I miss here at BIES? What questions do you have about BIES? What's your credit score? Comment below. Thank you so much for watching.

swki4VWii1k,"I recently went to the Golden Diner where Chef Sam Yu makes some of the best pancakes in the city. We're going for the same preparation that Sam Yu does. He basically makes one pancake at a time in a non-stick skillet, cooks it to the point of doneness on one side and then throws it underneath the broiler to catch the other side. So, you end up with these very thick pancakes. Then, instead of a fruit compost, I'm going to go with some spiced apples, bourbon fried apples that I'm going to hit with some ginger and cardamom and cinnamon and nutmeg. And of course, bourbon. Hopefully, we'll see some flames. And then we're going to also make some honey butter on top. We're just basically going to whip some Danish creamer butter in honey.

yzQFsmurEfM,"As you can see on my phone, it is currently today, April 20th, everybody's favorite holiday. And no matter what you're celebrating or how you're celebrating it, I wanted to make something celebratory using whatever I could find in the fridge. Luckily, I have some pretty cool stuff in my fridge. Between the chicken breast, mushrooms, duck fat, fun breading options, and popcorn flavored oil. I think I'm going to go for a sort of schnitle with a mushroom gravy. First, I'm going to mash together two parts softened butter to one part red miso. This is my upstairs side piece, golden whisk. I'm also going to add a ton of freshly ground pepper, a liberal sprinkle of smoked paprika, and a conservative sprinkle of cayenne pepper. Once nice and smooth, I'm going to paint it evenly and thoroughly all over some clusters of oyster mushrooms, which I'm going to roast at 375 with convection for about 25 minutes or until deeply golden brown and crisp. Next, I'm going to build the gravy out of about 2 tablespoons each duck fat and miso butter. This will burn real easy. So, as soon as it starts to foam, I'm adding half a small shallot, finally minced, gently sautéing, adding a clove of grated garlic and 2 tbsps of all-purpose flour. Gently cook for about 1 minute. And then the body of our sauce is going to be some whole milk. About a cup and a half's worth slowly streamed in one splash at a time and whisking until smooth before adding the next. Now it's time to add the mushrooms to the situation. So I'm going to roughly chop those. Add them to the gravy. Give it a stir and season to taste with kosher salt. Tons of freshly ground pepper and about a teaspoon each soy sauce, wished and dijon mustard. Give it a mix in several tastes, mostly to repeatedly affirm just how awesome this stuff tastes. Next up, breading the chicken. I'm making an equal mix of crushed up pretzels, corn flakes, and potato chips. Aiming for a consistency that's half fine particles, half big chunks. My chicken breasts are already pretty thin, so I'm just going to gently pound them out to a nice even thinness using rolling pin. Thoroughly coat in allpurpose flour. Shake off the excess. Thoroughly coat in thoroughly beaten egg and thoroughly coat in our breading mixture. Repeatedly pressing to make sure that all nooks and or crannies are filled. Now I'm going to shallow fry in a mixture of popcorn oil and light olive oil. Carefully lay down our chicken cutlets. Depending on which holiday you're celebrating, maybe don't do this. Professional driver, closed course, do not attempt, etc. But if you do, simply fry for a few minutes on each side at about 350° Fahrenheit. The chicken's going to cook really fast, just long enough for the breading to turn nice golden brown. Drain it on a wire rack. Give it the Tik Tok treatment and then generously sauce with our mushroom duck fat gravy. Garnish with freshly chopped herbs. I went with teragon and flank with some nice acidic accuch. All this celebration has me pretty hungry by this point. And I'm thrilled to say that, as you might imagine, this turned out really, really awesome. It's super crisp, crazy, flavorful, and umami forward. and the perfect thing to whip up when you just happen to have all this stuff on hand.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cHS_yXRDxlk,"Oh man, I I want to give this an embarrassing score. I don't see anything but improvement upon a pizza roll. And there's no fixing this. I It's too sour. That's amazing. That's so good.

What used to be This being a munchies episode, I have to have the munchies, right? Can't can't can't ta t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t taste test hangover remedies without a hangover, can you? So, I have this obtained from a legal state dispensary. Oh, yeah. Smells like a cross between Strawberry Brain Death and Flapjack OG. All right, I'm 100% sober. Not nervous at all. Definitely not worried what Steve's thinking about me. And I'm ready to start eating some of this insane. Okay, this is what I pictured if I'm being honest. Crunchy taco, chicken ramen seasoning on the noodles. We wouldn't let you do it plain. And then crispy fried onions, bacon bits, specifically bacon bits from the prepackaged container. Uh, and then they also recommended Sriracha. Uh, very wellexecuted idea. It It's exactly what it says it is. So that that it's it's that it doesn't look very good. I hate packaged taco shells so much. They always taste stale. I love that they're standing up of their own recgnizance. That's nice. Rather than a cheese pull from the taco, you get a ramen strand. Jesus Christ, that's depressing. Put some mayonnaise on it or something. It's so dry. This is awful. Do I have to tell you why this sucks? Don't you know? I can't even taste the bacon. That's saying something. I can't taste the bacon on these. I have the munchies hard right now. I've only had a smoothie on purpose this morning. so that I would be really hungry right now and I don't want to even look at this. Um, I'm gonna give this a two. I kind of want to have another bite of it, but only if nobody was looking. Not even me. Now, for each one of these snacks, I'm going to assign it a madeup weed strain name, of which I've written down several in my journal. You You think it's a picture of balls. You think it's some kind of genital cross-section or something? But no, with the steak and eggs and potato, the BRT, I think that's going to You got to be really ripped to uh even try to eat that. And you don't want to get dry mouth, so I'm going to go with an anti-d drymouth strain. In this case, it's going to be scarecrow drip. What the This one is called the just [ __ ] it. Uh, so this is a malleable pizza. So we have undercooked this slightly so that you can roll it. Ooh. Yes. I know. I know. I know. Are you so excited? Uh, and then we have nacho cheese Doritos. We have sour cream. We have pickled jalapenos. And we have a good amount of hot sauce. And these beautiful skewers that are put on top so that it doesn't fall apart. And you're supposed to eat it like a burrito. Oh, like a burrito. Yes. That's why it's like this. I was worried I was going to have to open it up and lick it or something. in full burrito. It looks good. I was making faces more thinking about what this is going to do to me physiologically. These are a lot of irritants, a lot of influence. This side's definitely meteor. I'm taking a side out of the meteor side. See that? It's probably going to be good. What am I belly aching about? The belly ache, I guess. I mean, here's the headline. I want another bite of that. I'm not going to. This is only number two. And we've already gone off the reservation. It's only sexual. It's only erotic. Carnal even. This lizard brain. It's your autonomic nervous system saying, ""Put more of the fuel. That's good fuel."" I I wanted to give this an embarrassing score, like a a six or something, but I know I'm just stoned. But that's why I got stoned. I would say it's too gooey, but the the Doritos give it crunch and give it body. I like the jalapenos, too. The nice hot hit. It's [ __ ] it. I don't care. It's good. It's the trashiest in the world, and I love it. They specified undercooked pizza, right? I think if you just none up and get it cooked and wrap it while it's still hot and malleable, and then you won't have this really kind of gummy doughy thing going on. Bearing that in mind, I'm going to give it a five because the method is flawed. If you were to do what I just said, I think it might be a six. Oh boy. What am I doing here? All right, let's get cast and crews reactions. This tastes like cheese smells. There it is. There it is. I like that. That is good. Pizza with like some nachos. Dude, I this up. We ate every single bite of it. All right. The it. pretty heavy and I'm guessing it's the only thing you're going to eat. So, you got to have couch lock. You're not going out. You're not do eating that on the go. So, I think that's going to be a um an indacica like a grandmaster factory. Um it's just called sugar tomatoes. No, I was hoping that was salts. Honestly, sugar. I hate sweet tomatoes. I tried to fix Buddy's breakfast dessert pasta from E.L.F. And I tried to make a sweet tomato something and it was horrible and I can't stand it. Anyway, this one is going to be just as probably worse cuz those are just little tiny baby tomatoes covered in sugar and they said cut them in half so that it adheres to it and the juices mix. Thank you for for this offering. Okay, I'm not going to like this. So, is that not bad? I was trying to make something that was primarily sweet, that was tomato flavored, almost more sugar than tomato. This is mostly tomato with a little bit of sugar, which is just like mama's recipe sauce, mama's sauce. Cherry tomatoes are quite acidic. And this is just a tiny little dusting of sugar. But if I were just going to eat cherry tomatoes, the these taste better. Do these taste better than just cherry tomatoes on their own? If cherry tomatoes alone, just as a snack by themselves are five because they're cherry tomatoes. They're tolerable. This is better. Six for sugar and tomatoes. For the tomatoes, I'm just going to go off word association here and go with the tarpina twaddle sauce. This has a great name. It's called Greek yogurt with ranch seasoning and Takis. That's literally the name. What the? Uh, it is it is in fact Greek yogurt with Hidden Valley Ranch. They said, quote, ""I like a lot of ranch."" So, I we hammered it. Why aren't they springing for sour cream or making making just using ranch? Why don't we just use ranch? It's upsetting. I agree cuz I tasted it and I'm wishing you the best of luck. They trying to cut calories with Takis. I know. It sort of negates itself. What was it called? Takis dipped in Greek yogurt with Trader Joe's ranch seasoning. Literally, that's the title. I have no idea why you're using Greek yogurt uh in lie of literally anything that would be [Music] tasty. Oh, first of all, yes, that is a lot of ranch seasoning. It's so sour. Everything about this is so sour. the Takis Fuego with lime. Like these are sour as sour grapes on their own. And then you got Greek yogurt which is tangy. It's sour. It's just compounding. And the two It's an echo chamber of sourness. Yeah, there's no fixing this. I It's too sour. It's an interesting direction, but like too intense of a thing to be eating with regularity. H. This is a three. This is not very good. This feels like a young man's game. I don't think anybody over 30 has eaten this. I hope not. God. So, I'm gonna try to find the most like Gen Z name for a weed strain that I wrote down. How about uh Glitter Bomb Pumpern Nickel? An overwhelming mismatch. It's actually perfect. What am I saying? Like, what does Glitter Bomb have to do with pumpern Nickel? What does Takis have to do with Greek yogurt? Check. Okay, so this one kind of looks like a butthole. Sorry. Um, I'll face it out for camera. We have a classic dates filled with goat cheese. One half of it specifically filled with goat cheese. The other half stuffed like capped with a hazelnut and then wrapped in bacon. They're put in a lot of effort when they're stoned. Retrospect. I was going to say this is just this just got classy. This is just a delicious appetizer. Does look like a butthole. Do you know what I mean? Okay, everything's going to squish out. So, that's pretty fantastic. This is a play on Devil's on Horseback, which is almost the same thing. Dates stuffed with blue cheese wrapped in bacon. I'm not a huge fan of Devils on Horseback cuz I'm not crazy about blue cheese. Goats cheese, while still a strong flavor, is much more is much better matched against these these two. Next time I make Devils on Horseback, I'm I'm going to do them this way. I kind of feel like some balsamic vinegar would be really nice in there. All right, let's see what this does. That's awesome. That's awesome. It's It's a magnumopus. We We did it together. I think we got a nine kum 10. Did I use that word correctly? Kum, you know, like magnaum latte. Uhhuh. With so nine whatever I'm going to say it. Nine kum 10. I just want to sound collegiate. Hats off to Andrew. This is fantastic. I love it. I want to smoke a joint with you sometime. And uh for weed strain, let's do uh Madagascar twinkle toes. How pretty. Well, it's actually a piece of white bread with a thin amount of Marmite on it and apple. Marmite and apple. Honestly, who knows? Who knows at this point? I'm not a huge Marmite fan. I like it as an ingredient. it. Um, I keep looking at both cameras and that's probably not ideal. We could just cut to whatever you're looking at. I think it's time I try a [Music] bite. Oh man. Oh, that's terrible. It's somehow dry. I don't know how it's like I may have dry I have dry mouth. This is not dry mouth approved. You can't have dry mouth and eat this or you mind. You're going to choke to death. You live alone. You don't taste the apple at all. The apple's barely there as a texture. If you like Marmite, you you probably like this. What it does is kills the sugar in the apple. So you you got no sweetness going on here. And it sneeze like honey or something. It's bitter. It's aggressive. It's a toxic masculine coated. Right, kids? You took three things that can be good in different iterations either on their own or with other stuff and made them negated all of them. So, I don't care for that one bit. I'm going to give it a two because it strikes me as European given them Marmite. Uh I'm going to assign it uh Norwegian Dadbod. It's great. Turpp heavy. Turpp heavy strain. Big turpps. Lots of turpps. This is a heavy hitter to me. Oh my. What is in store for me? Right. Okay, this one is called the spam egg and cheese. Pan seared spam topped with American cheese, melted. Then a fried egg that's fried in the spam grease very specifically. Clever. Roasted red peppers and hot sauce. That sounds pretty good actually. Yeah, like I would I would Let's bust it, right? Because I'm going to bust I'm going to bust the yolk. I'm bust all over this yolk. The roasted red peppers. I think are going to be a nice touch. Oh, it's drippy. Just like a Owen Han sandwich. All right, this is probably my best bet. That's pretty freaking good. I mean, low chance this was going to be bad. The roasted red peppers are a nice touch. Uh, normally I don't like everything bagels for breakfast sandwiches. I know I'm a monster, but these flavors play like you got strong flavors going on in here. You got fried spam that is not subtle. It's not a light meal, but it stands up to those spices really nicely. It's not the best breakfast sandwich I've ever had, but like I would I'd probably crush this whole thing. No problem. I don't like it as much as my preferred breakfast sandwich, which just sausage, egg, and cheese. If that's a 10 to me, this that by proxy, this has to be a nine. If I prefer that, if I would order that over this, this has to this that makes this in my eyes a nine. I'm going to give it my uh my one of my favorite names I came up with and it's it's appropriately themed which is um Flapjack OG. Okay. And things have taken its turn. Uh classic graham cracker topped with cheese whiz and a little bit of pickled jalapeno. Who does this? Who does this? I know. I want to know how stupid this person was. They said jalapeno cheese whiz, but there was nothing available. So, I took a bit of creation. How much do you think it was their stone? And how much do you think it was? This is what we have to right now. 100%. This is what's in our pantry, so we're just going to use it. Can't even squish it down. Gone. Got to fit in my mouth. I got to fit it in my mouth. I love graham crackers. I don't want to ruin one. Um, no. I don't I don't like that cheese whiz on Do I have to explain this? Graham cracker tastes sweet and then it just cheese just appears out of nowhere. It's It's the mouth equivalent of having your dessert before dinner. It's not as satisfying. It's not as fun. And also, let's just face facts. It's cheese whiz on a on a on a graham cracker. I don't need to I don't need to explain this. Didn't need to. I chose to anyway. I'm going to do it again. If I were starving to death, I'd eat that. I think that gets you two. For this one, let's go with um trillhop whistle wart. This is the strawberry milk bowl by Moon, please. They said they make it specifically in a wooden bowl. Yeah. Okay. Uh, chop the strawberries into cubes and then put as much milk as you are comfortable with and then two to three heaping spoonfuls of sugar. I went for two cuz I didn't want to kill you. So, thanks. It's basically a deconstructed strawberry milk. I was going to say what gluten-free cereal was up until 2005. Absolutely. Okay. It's probably not going to be bad. I mean, sugar milk with strawberries. I was like, and it it sounds like something that fairies eat in a in a in a in a fantasy children's novel or something. Not that I was I was saying a nice thing, not a bad thing. There's fairies in kids books. I can't [ __ ] stand these fairies. My daughter's story books. I don't know, man. It's just watered down strawberries and crepe. I think it's too I think two tablespoons is too much sugar. But, you know, I love fruit when I'm stoned. It's very refreshing. It's the antithesis of what's usually being suggested or fed to you. I want it to be strawberries and cream, though, and just whipped cream. But it's still good. I'll give it a six. It's confusing, but I I'd continue to eat this. And appropriately enough, I'm gonna assign this weed strain to it, which is strawberry brain death. Oh, so beautiful. Wait, wait, wait. No, no. Somebody's pranking us. No, this one is called the pizza cream pie. So, specifically leftover cold pizza. a slathering of creamy peanut butter and then it's supposed to be dipped directly into whipped cream. And I'm going to watch from the sidelines on this one because my god. Thanks. Yes. 420 blaze it. 420 blaze. I think I'm going to need it. We'll be right back. Peanut butter pepperoni. Put it in a cheese pocket. Oh, there's a peanut butter stretch. It was like a tiny little cheese stretch. This what you've been training for? Nope. Oh, that looks so bad. You have a little peanut butter on your nose. And you can enter to win to kiss it off. [Applause] Their name is Toast Man. Toast man. Toast man strikes again. It's my nemesis. Damn you, Toast Man. There's no peanut butter in a Boston cream pie. Well, pizza pet pizza. Wait, is it pizza pizza cream pie? Pizza cream pie. What's the peanut butter for? Put some chocolate on there. Maybe that would work. That would be way better. No, it wouldn't. Zero. It's terrible. This is the worst. It's terrible. What awful dirt weed I'm going to sign you. All right, I think my meanest one, which is uh Fantastic 4est fire. Oo yeah, I went there. Happy April fool. I mean 420. This is lazy street corn and it's a can of corn microwaved and then you add mayonnaise, parmesan cheese, a little bit of chili powder or pepper. Okay. I mean, as a side, like I don't know if I would whip up a bowl of this and munch down when I'm stoned, but divorcing this entirely from illotees. Um, makes it just a completely serviceable like Midwestern weekn night dinner side dish. Yeah, you wouldn't sit down to just house a bowl of this. Then again, if they're submitting it as a stoner snack, then they must, right? Who eats a whole can of corn? That's why we grow so much corn in this country is that people are just eating it like it's savory cereal. So, I don't know how to reconcile that. Like, how do I grade it as a food as like this is the my meal? What am I doing? What would Joshua Weissman rate this deep breath? It's tasty. I'm I'm going to give it a three because it's not disgusting. It's kind of tasty, but it's it's nuts to just sit here and just eat corn. I mean, I've been there. No judgment, but I'm judging this as a three. Okay. The poor man's churro. Soften butter, cinnamon, sugar, and then spread it all over a tortilla and then crisp it up in oil and then let it cool cuz it's liquid hot magma right now. Right now it's liquid hot magma. Literally right now. Is that a challenge? Are you locking horns with me right now? All right, let's eat it. I don't know. Oh. Oh, no. It's delicious. You know, it's a Is it in oil? Yeah. To crisp it in oil. I guess it's so full of oil. It's got so much oil in it. I mean, this is gross, but it tastes good. I don't care. Like, if my eyes were closed, we were getting freaky like that. some blindfold in this scenario. Four. I'll give it a four. It's delicious to taste and it's it's a horrible thing to behold. And as for weed strain, I have to wipe all the butter grease off my fingers. Caramel coronary. Very gentle. Gentle indica. Just enough to make you not give a what you just did to the catch. Okay, this one I think will be very nice honestly. Chika masala quesadilla. I know. Take a little simmer sauce maybe had leftover at the house. A bit of Mexican pre-shredded cheese, butter, call it a day. This is interesting cuz I I don't think I've ever had tikka masala with cheese. I haven't either. So, you're going to want to try this? I think so, too, cuz like paneer. That's it. Works. Exactly. As if tikka masala weren't already creamy enough. Here's some cheese to remind you. Wait, is it just cheese that's the source of the creaminess? Literally, that's it. That's brilliant cuz it's it's it's just like you're already mixing it with dairy. It's a perfect match. Mhm. Wow. This is good. This is inspired. Oh my god. Bookish minnow. This is fabulous. No notes. It's a perfect munchie snack. You got just the right amount of heat. Is there Would you say there was protein in this? Chicken? No, but it would be nice if it I I would take chicken in this. You put some chicken or some tofu, whatever protein you want in there, something to give it body, you'd have a 10. I'm going to give it a nine. I love it. And this was a top-notch. I got to give it a top-notch strain, right? And that one, I think, is going to be single malt swizzle sticks. Mostly downhill from here. Bless you for letting me know. Yes. I like to start high, go low, you know, at the end. This is I'll face it out because you can see those cute little hot dogs hanging out. This is hot dog toast from Glyph Max. Cold hot dogs cut into I'm sorry. Cold cold hot dogs cut into halves widthwise and then again topped with American cheese, sweet and sour sauce and ketchup and then panini little griddle action. So, I'm hoping that the warmth of the specified cold hot dogs. Yes, they said don't cook these hot dogs. Correct. There was no cooking allowed. It was just the heat from the pan to warm the beautiful spreads. Well, that's passive aggressive. Yeah, I agree. That That's an That's an attack. It is. All right. They're pretty thin. They're probably warm. Yeah. I can't wait to hear how this one goes. Me either. Let's listen in. All right. They're they're skin temperature. They're bath water after 15 minutes. I would say not food safe. You're supposed to heat things to 145° F. Flavor-wise, it's not bad. Like sweet and sour sauce, American cheese, hot dog. Like these things kind of make sense. Not on paper, but in practice. I don't know. How much am I enjoying myself while while I eat this? Not Not much. Is this better than just toasting up some bread like I've done when I'm broke and I can't I don't have hot dog buns and just using it as a hot dog bun. Yes. So, uh, sorry, I zoned out. Six. We're going to do six now. And with this, I think you should smoke Santa Cruz control. Please tell me that's just peanut butter. I thought you said it was all downhill from here. I'd like to throw in a couple treats. You know, rascal. Oh, darn it. Such a rat scallion. It's beautifully called double stuffed Oreos opened up add peanut butter vanilla almond milk. That's what the title is. So, you know, really leads a lot to, you know, you just kind of bearing the lead. And Dennis said specifically, extra bonus points if you use a fork to dunk your Oreos. I mean, that's just being pedantic. I know. That's insane. No, I think you Oh, yeah. No. Slips slips right in. Except Oh, no. This is hazardous. If I bite down, I can't I'm supposed I don't You tell me I got to house this whole [ __ ] thing. Yeah. Or barely stick it in one frenzied [Music] gulp. That's amazing. That's so good. When you chew this, it mixes the peanut butter together effortlessly with this sugar paste and it becomes the ideal filling for a Reese's cup. And then you got the chocolate shell and it's I would love it if it was chocolateier. If these were dipped in chocolate, my je sweet god. But that's not going to rob you of a 10 because this is it's incredible. I love it. I loved getting the whole thing dunked cuz that is hazardous when you when you dunk like this. You're either getting your fingers wet or you're doing it in two bites. 10. I love it. This is a good one uh for um Babaie Paradise. What have we got here? This one is by Ludacris and it's just called stuffed pickles. I absolute power to this person for putting in this much work. So, you have to core the inside of the pickle, get the guts out, leave the pickle flesh, then take 1/2 in cubes of sharp cheddar cheese alternating with a peanut. I thought that's what I saw and I was hoping I was wrong. Don't know why they wanted salty soggy peanuts in there, but it's not mine. It's Ludicrous's beautiful idea. Cheese. I could I could abide kind of this. I don't know. Peanuts and pickles. Yeah. Prospecting. Hate that. Hate that. Such small pieces of cheddar. Tiny little pieces. I think if you did one of the Sarento cheddar blocks and you'd cut that in half and you'd shove it in there. And I think that would work. It just pooped out some cheese. But the pickle and peanut is disrespectful. I think honestly it's a I'm going to give it a two. It's terrible. Sorry, Luda. Get back, mother. You don't you you don't know me like that. Anyway, oh uh weed strainer. Um I think I'll use yours for this, which is uh the uh Steve's contribution is Dame Judy Stench, which I love. It's what I'm going to start calling her next time I see her. This looks involved. Yes. This is by DVCV. It's called White Trash Techucky. Is this cheeseburger tekboki? It is like ready-made tikkboki that you just cook, you know, with a little bit of water. Two very specifically said frozen hamburger patties. Okay. All right. All right. This work. You poke it with a fork a whole bunch. Cover it steamed with the lid on and then let all the juices come out. Then cook the techbaki in the frozen meat juices. Okay. And then you add three slices of American cheese. You're done. It smells like hamburger helper to me. So it does. Oh, and you're supposed to put rock chocolate. All right, this hurt. This is going to rock pretty hard. Honestly, this is going to be good. Uh, why does everybody just smoke weed all the time? Life's way better. Side note, I love Tukboki so much. It's pretty gacky. Pretty gacked out. Like pasty. The American cheese, it shuts up, you know? I just think it needs Yeah. See, it's really gluey. If you put a little milk in there, the American cheese is an amazing emulsifier and it would just kind of dissolve right into the milk and you just have a a gooier, looser sauce. I don't even want to try the burger, but I will out of respect. I'm not going to spit it out cuz that sent me back in time. That tastes exactly like a high school cheeseburger. It's not good, but it made me feel like a miserable child again. If you added a little milk to the sauce, I would give this a six. But as it is, I think I'd need to give it a five because it has very pleasurable aspects to it. I love Tukboki so much that I don't mind how gluey it is. The hot sauce on the Toki is it's wonderful. The burgers are deplorable. The the only thing they have going for them is nostalgia, like a Furby. And the weed strain for this is going to be Johnny Trauma. very heavy strain. You won't even think about what you're eating. You'll just put it in your face. This one I wish was called adult lunchable, but it is in fact called bologoney folded with white American cheese. I was worried. I thought you were going to say bunchable. I Oh, that would have been way better though. You're supposed to eat it like a taco. Side note. Uh that is what not like a not like a roll. Nope. Taco. They said that's going to be a beautiful glue on the We've got a lot of glue. A beautiful glue. Yeah, that's I hope you enjoy a more perfect glue. Yes. Yeah. You know, if you're watching your carbs, this feels like a Michael Scott move. Just like I want a bologn sandwich. Got got to watch those carbs. I was about to take another bite, though. It's not bad. It's just silly. Just roll it. Yeah. It creates a pleasing pattern to the eye, sort of. And it the cheese hangs onto it, glues itself. Are you kidding me? It's self adhering and you're folding it in half. Sorry, I don't mean to sound judgmental. Anybody who wants to do this, do this. Seven. Five. Seven. That's how strongly I feel about the rolling process is that it buys you two points. All right. This is so much more joyous and and nostalgic to me. Turkey roll-ups, bologn roll-ups. Like this is this is so that they specified this is why they're being punished. It gives me no pleasure to do that. That looks like a little omelette but reverse style on the the taco one. Oh yeah. It's like the meat on the outside of the omelet. Even that I would give you I'd give you a six if you called it an omelette. If I were having a bologn and cheese taco, the banana hammock PhD. But if I were having a rollup, I'd give it some wild thornberry. Okay, this is called a gummy dumpling. So this is a fruit roll up. Then you fill the fruit roll up with gushers. Then you roll the outside around the gushers. Then you take the fruit by the foot and you mummify it. Those were the exact words. The big three. Yeah, the big three. Big three. Honestly, it's a trifecta. It's the It's kind of the holy holy trinity. Sounds pretty great, actually. I'm trying to find fault with it. [Applause] I mean, it's overwhelming. It's the only I I had to sit here and try to think of what word captures the experience of eating this, and it's overwhelming. More textures than you'd think considering they're all made out of the same stuff. It's obviously not like a like a pizza and ice cream moment. It's um it's it's an it's a powerful addition to nothing. Not one of these is adding to the other. Well, they are. Hold on. Not one of these is enhancing the other. It's just adding to it. Personally, I would much rather just enjoy all three of these separately. I think we have a bucket situation on our hands, wherein I will give this a six because if this was all I had, I'd eat it. But I'd much rather just have these alone. Uh, I think best option here is going to be you got to get real [ __ ] up for this one. So, fatty fender vendor. Is this the last one? This the last one. Oh my god, we're going out with a bang. We have here pizza roll nachos. So, these are specifically combination Totino's pizza rolls, air fried until super crispy, topped with freshly shredded Monterey Jack cheese, broiled, then topped with sour cream, salsa, guacamole, fresh jalapeno coins, and crystal hot sauce. And that's the majesty. This is the end of cool running. We're doing a slow. This looks great. This looks like a good time. Looks like real good time at the movies. What is there to be mad at? I love pizza rolls and I don't see anything but improvement upon a pizza roll. [Music] 40, 50, 60. No, I mean just 10 over and over across the board. 10 across the board. Feel like I'm in a sleepover or something, but a really high quality sleepover. I'm going to give it 10 because I I I adore it. Anything I don't like about it is snoody. Like crusts are a little chewy on the pizza rolls. Like if you eat this and you are like, ""This is dumb. You're dead inside. You're not dead, but you're dying."" Take a look. You know, it's scary looking in that mirror, but the rewards are great. And what a way to go out on go out and have a bang. I'm so tired and I'm so stoned and I'm so full and I'm so wired and a lot going on right now. So, this is pizza roll nachos. That sounds like a pretty good weed strain on its own. But then we didn't really do anything. We're not making an actual weed strain. Happy 420. So, what have we learned today? Weed's fun. Food's good. Friends are the best. Love is magic. I don't know. It's a good time. Happy 420, y'all. And please comment below. What are your favorite munchies? Which ones did I miss? Which ones did I grade erroneously? And do you want to see us try and fix some of these munchies that had promise? Particularly the tuk boki one. We were brainstorming like crazy on that one. Comment below all that stuff that I just said, please. Thank you very much for watching and thank you for making this my job. It's rules. Thank you. You guys are the best.

NYPxT4K-jEw,"You know how when you drink something in the summer that's too sweet, it just leaves you more thirsty? I've always loved aua de kamika, the iconic iced Mexican hibiscus tea, because it's sweet enough to satisfy that craving, but tart enough to stay interesting, and it always quenches my thirst. So, it was only natural that I had to try to turn it into the most refreshing dessert there is, a granita. And I lucked out because this is really the easiest dessert you could ever make. All you have to do is make the tea from these dried soral leaves, add your desired amount of sugar, and then pour it onto a baking sheet. The hardest part, admittedly, is transporting the baking sheet to the freezer and finding a place to put it. The tea is just dying to jump out of it, and it stains the hell out of anything it touches. When you mix it up and drag your fork through it, you'll see these beautiful streaks of purple jump out at you. After another hour to fully set up, mix it up one more time and then plate it up with some whipped cream. I added some condensed milk to mine to get a really milky essence to it. And I topped it with some lime zest. And this is, to put it lightly, summer in a cup. And all you have to do is not spill it. The recipe is on babby.sh.

Y8ATCIixBeg,"Let me go to Big Head Joe's for you. They have the most insane burritos. I don't much go for ethnic food. No, trust me. They have one that's called the meat tornado. Literally killed a guy last year. You had me at Meat Tornado. Hey, what's up, guys? Welcome back to Binging with Babish, and welcome to the new Binging with Babish Kitchen, a sprawling two-level garden apartment that I have retrofitted into the playplace of my dreams. I'll be taking you guys on a proper tour of this space soon so you can see all the new toys and tools. Now, before we dig into the meat tornado, we must first go back in time to the old apartment where I enlisted some help from an expert to ensure that this burrito could in fact kill a man. Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with me today. Uh, I understand that you are a doctor of nutrition. Yes, I'm a medical doctor and I'm what they call a physician nutrition specialist. I'm recognized by the National Board of Physician Nutrition Specialists. Well, it sounds like they could really use somebody like you in Panee, Indiana because, as I understand, it's a very unhealthy town. Well, that's what that's what they uh the clip you showed him flies. Yeah, for sure. According to legend of this um burrito place in Pony, a gentleman uh uh was killed by a burrito referred to as the meat tornado. Horrible way though. Yet there actually are true cases of death by meat consumption, usually flake, and those are called cafe coronaries. Now, if it was in a Mexican restaurant, so that you wouldn't call that a cafe coronary. I guess you'd call that a coachina coronary, right? So you you are you are a doctor of nutrition and humor, it would seem. Well, trying to be a little humorous, but but yeah, you could die from eating. So let's think about not just the meat but the burrito is going to have spices in it, right? So if it was a really hot chili that could somebody who has existing coronary disease and they could then induce a coronary. Yeah, that that could happen. So assume that there are no size limitations on this burrito. Uh can you think of a just a rough idea of you have a patient that has heart issues? Don't eat this much meat or it could kill you where you sit. I would say you're probably in that category. Yeah. In the pounds worth of consumption. All right. So, I I I think maybe the benchmark I'm trying to hit is maybe like 2 lbs worth of meat. All right. Well, Wow. I mean, as long as as long as it kills them, that's that's uh that's my end game. Yes, it could kill them. All right. Well, I'm going to try to do this as as true to form to uh what we've determined here. And uh we're going to we're going to try to have this be a message of health because you shouldn't eat things called a meat tornado. I don't think. No, I would I think that's one thing to stay away from. Well, thank you so much for talking with me today, doctor. I appreciate it and thanks uh thanks for saving lives. Armed with this lethal knowledge, I set out to make a 2 lb spicy bean and meat fil burrito with a license to kill. First up, flank steak. In a simple marinade of 1/4 cup each, lemon juice, vegetable oil, soy sauce, and chicken stock. Half a teaspoon cayenne pepper. 1 tbsp ground cumin, 1/4 cup of white sugar, two crushed cloves of garlic, and about a tablespoon each kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. And because we're trying to be legit or authentic or whatever, a whole lot of fresh chopped cilantro. Tiny whisk until homogeneous. And then we're going to pour it over our flank steak to make a sort of carne asada. Remember that marinating your meat in a bowl or casserole helps prevent crosscontamination in the fridge. Once everybody's evenly bathed in the marinade, we're going to cover and fridge for about 4 hours, flipping once or twice throughout the process. Now, on to the next meat of mention, carnitas, for which we're going to need a whole bone in pork shoulder, which we must first debone, deskin, and defat to some extent. Basically, we want to scrape as much meat off the bone as possible. Remove and reserve the skin if you want to make chicharon. Remove any excess fat and cut the meat into 2-in pieces, which we're going to cook in what some might call an irresponsible amount of lard. 2 lbs of the stuff along with one cup of water go into a large wide deep Dutch oven, which we're going to set over mediumigh heat until the lard is completely melted. And then, slowly and carefully, we're going to add the pork to the party. In addition to the pork, we're going to add the juice and flesh of two large navl oranges cut in half. Just squeeze them, drop them in, and bring this whole thing to a bare simmer. Once the simmer is reached, lower the heat to medium low and maintain a bare simmer for about 2 hours. At first, the pork is going to braze. But then once all the water evaporates, it's going to start to effectively deep fry. After the first hour, we're going to fish out the orange rind and replace them with half a large onion roughly chopped, and four large cloves of garlic crushed, four dried bay leaves, two sticks of cinnamon, a teaspoon of whole cumin seeds, and a tablespoon of Mexican oregano. This, as you can well imagine, is going to smell unbelievable. But we're not done. We're also adding a/2 cup each light Mexican beer and evaporated milk, which at first I thought was kind of odd. But as the pork simmerred for an additional hour, it turned out to be awesome. All the milk proteins separated and adhered to the meat and began to brown gorgeously, leaving me with crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, tender, flavorful carnitas, which I'm going to go ahead and fridge until we're ready to use because they're going to reheat beautifully right back in the oil. Next up, our chicken representative at the table is going to be tinga de poo. A simple brazed spicy saucy shredded chicken, which we're going to make as juicy as possible by searing skin-on bonein chicken breasts, which is both going to protect the delicate meat, give us some nice flavor in the braise, and give us some nice fond on the bottom of the pot. Once the chicken has some color on both sides, we're setting it aside and dumping in one large onion, roughly chopped, and two cloves of garlic. We're just sautéing those for a few minutes, letting them pick up some color and letting them pick up all that good stuff on the bottom of the pot. Then we are delazing with 1 cup of chicken stock, 1 tbsp of apple cider vinegar, a 14oz can of crushed fire roasted tomatoes, and one can of chipotle chilies in adobo sauce. We're also going to add 1 teaspoon each ground cumin and Mexican oregano. Bring the whole affair to a rolling simmer and drop the chicken breasts back in the hot tub where they're going to braze for about 45 minutes until the chicken is nice and tender and cooked through and so are the vegetables. Once everybody's nice and happy, we're going to pull the chicken breasts out and use an immersion blender to blend our vegetables and chilies into a smooth but still little chunky sauce. Then, once we've removed the chicken's bones and skin, we're going to shred it using two forks and return it and any accumulated juices back to the pan. Season with kosher salt, freshly ground pepper, and simmer for 10 or so minutes just to let those flavors get to know each other. Taste for seasoning, and then it's time to contend with the final fighter in our meat cage match. Our flank steak has finished marinating and is ready for the grill, or in this case, the plunch. Once we've removed some of the excess herbs and garlic so they do not burn, this guy is going to respond especially well to any super hot cooking surface. I'm going with some well lubricated and thoroughly preheated cast iron. Once little wisps of smoke emerge from its surface, we lay down the steak and leave it undisturbed for about 5 minutes until its first side has been emlazed with a deep dark brown char. The sugar in the marinade is what helps give this steak its beautiful crust. And it is going to hang out in the oven while we prepare the final element of our burrito, the burrito, for which we're going to need one extra large tortilla. Into the bowl of a food processor goes 8 1/2 oz of all-purpose flour, a teaspoon of kosher salt, and 2 oz of refrigerator cold lard. Process together until it resembles coarse crumbs. Then we're going to slowly add 3/4 of a cup of cold water while the machine runs until a rough ball of dough forms, which we're going to knead on a lightly flowered work surface until it feels smooth and elastic. Then we're going to wrap it in plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature for about 15 minutes because its gluten needs to be very relaxed for what we're about to put it through. That's right, little ball of dough. You are not being used to make 8 to 12 separate tortillas. No, no, you are going to make one giant tortilla. First, we got to preheat our pa pan. maybe practice our scoop technique. Also, we got to make sure that it's preheated evenly since it's so much bigger than the flame. Once it's good and smoking hot, we're going to lower the flame a little bit while we roll out our tortilla on a generously fled work surface. I was going for a tortilla with about the same diameter as my paella pan, which turned out to be my first of many mistakes. After gently unfurling it, much like a pie crust, I learned that it should indeed be slightly smaller than the paella pan. Otherwise, this is going to happen. I tried my darnest to salvage this giant tortilla. But it also turned out to be very, very tender. And because I was focused on it tearing so easily, I forgot to help it cook evenly in the paella pan. So, it ended up being burnt in the center, raw on the outsides, ripped, torn, and full of holes. But let me ask you this, must do. Well, Alfred, it's so we can learn how to pick ourselves up. On my next try, I used only half the batch of dough, which I rolled out thinner and smaller. I also kneaded the dough twice as long so as to develop the gluten so it wouldn't be so delicate. Immediately after getting it in the pan, I tried to evenly disperse the heat so the tortilla would cook evenly. And rather than use a rolling pin, I'm not entirely sure why I did that, I used a pizza peel to flip the gargantuan tortilla. Cheers emanated through the kitchen as it was successfully flipped and we could all see the burrito that it was to become. Once cooked, there was only one thing left to do. Turn it into a meat delivery system. So, back over on the worktop, we're going to start prepping our meat for burrito insertion. The flank steak is very important to slice thinly across the grain. If you slice it with the grain, you're going to end up chewing on sho strings rather than meat. The carnitas, once reheated, need only be shredded or chopped into bite-sized pieces. They are one of the most delicious substances on planet Earth. And if there's one thing to make from this episode, it's them. Because, as we established with Dr. Rothkco, what we're about to do, you should not attempt at home. The time has come to stack our tortilla proudly. carne asada followed by carnitas. Then I'm laying down the cheese and topping with tinga de poo so it melts more effectively. Some reffried beans to help induce cafe coronary. And since we want this thing to be spicy, I can think of no better final topping than a few big glugs of the last dab I was given as a consolation prize for being on Hot Ones. And as you can see, I am not being sparing with this hot sauce that clocks in at more than 2 million Scoville units. Last but not least, we got to make a burrito out of this thing. So, I'm going to try my best to employ proper burrito rolling technique. Tuck in the sides, roll it over on itself, tuck in the bottom, carry the seven. And there you have it, folks. A slightly sloppy, but nonetheless legitimate meat tornado. And I'm sorry you can't see the numbers on the scale, but it clocks in at 1 lb 15.8 oz. So, I'm comfortable with going ahead and calling this a 2 pounder. Before we can dig in, of course, we have to take a look at that crosssection. And unfortunately, I got a little excited and cut in too early, so the cheese wasn't fully melted yet. But I was still nothing short of ecstatic to dig in. And I'll tell you something, folks. It was blow your pants off delicious. It was something I would have made a valiant effort to enter into the clean plate club until I remembered it was positively slathered in the last dab. Oh no. Oh no. Oh, it's hot. I want another bite. Ah, it's hot. Okay. Oh, okay. Yeah, that could kill a guy. The Punchburger dinner for breakfast burger combo. It tastes amazing. What's in it? Who cares? How many calories? Shut up. It's awesome. Put it in your body or you're a nerd. Hey, what's up guys? Welcome back to Binging with Babish, where this week in the first episode of a Parks and Wreck trilogy, we are taking a look at the fabled Ponchburg burger. Specifically, the grease ball extravaganza known as the dinner for breakfast combo. Even by my most conservative estimates, this burger and fry combo is going to clock in at around 2400 calories. In no small part thanks to the chili cheese fries. So, first up, I'm making a very basic beef chili. Saute some onions for about 3 minutes. Add some crushed garlic, 2 tbsps of chili powder, 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper, teaspoon of sweet paprika, and a teaspoon of oregano. Saute 1 to 2 minutes or until fragrant. And now I've got my pound of beef from Food and Stuff. Ooh, let's get rid of that beef bandage. Break up the beef and sauté for 5 to 7 minutes or until no longer pink. Then we're adding a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes and maybe 1/4 cup of water. Bringing to a bare simmer, partially covering and allowing to simmer over low heat for an hour to an hour and a half until it's nice and thick and all the flavors have melted and it strikes you as chili fry ready. As always, we're going to wait for the chili to finish cooking before tasting for seasoning and adding kosher salt and freshly ground pepper to taste. This can be made up to 3 days ahead of time, but for now, I'm just going to cover it and keep it warm because we got lots of other stuff to make. First up, the cheese sauce, whose method we are deriving from J. Kenji Lopez Alt. Into a small saucepan, we are combining one can of evaporated milk and 8 ounces of grated sharp cheddar that we have tossed together with one tablespoon of cornstarch. Maybe a dash or two of hot sauce if you want to be taken seriously. Go ahead and cook this over medium heat, stirring constantly until it has thickened into a cheese sauce. Set that aside and keep it warm while we contend with what look to me like onion rings stacked betw twixed the hamburger patties. So, I am slicing two large Spanish onions into big old thick steak-like slices, separating them into rings and spreading them out on a parchment line baking sheet. Again, in a technique adapted from the one and only Jay Kenji Lopez Alt. These onions are headed into the freezer until frozen solid at least 1 hour. Not only is this going to break down their cellular structure so they become tender, it's also going to allow us to very easily peel off their inner membrane after thawing in a bowl of tepid water. These membranes are the leading cause of onion ring coating related slippage. So by removing them, you will have tender onion rings that will not slip out of their protective fried coating. Our onions are ready to go, but whatever you do, do not throw away your onion water. This is going to be integral, and I'm just kidding. You can toss it, especially because we need the bowl to make our beer batter. Into said bowl goes 1 cup of cake flour, half a cup of cornstarch, 1 teaspoon of baking powder, half teaspoon of baking soda, and an optional shake of paprika. Tiny whisk to a state of homogeneity. And then it is time to introduce our liquids to the party. 3/4 of a cup of beer and 1/4 cup of vodka. Let's go ahead and pour it on in there. Oh, no, wait, I'm right-handed. We got to switch this around. Sorry. Sometimes I forget. Anyway, we are whisking constantly while we add the beer and vodka mixture. In the end, we want the batter to have the consistency of paint. Over on the stove top, we are heating one quart each vegetable and peanut oil to 375° F. Once our target temperature is reached, it's time to dip the onion rings in the beer batter. Let the excess drip off and drop them into the awaiting fry oil, frying for about 1 minute per side. Before evacuating onto a wire rack set in a rim baking sheet. If your onion rings are sputtering and spattering too much, make sure that they are super dry. And once everybody is fried, make sure to season them with kosher salt while they are still warm and keep them that way in a 200° Fahrenheit oven whilst we make our final burger preparations. First, on a lightly oiled cast iron skillet set over mediumigh heat, we are going to perform the integral act of toasting our buns. Buns toasted, we're going to crank the heat up to high and introduce our burgers to the party. three third lb patties seasoned generously with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper and allowed to sear undisturbed for 3 to 5 minutes on their first side until a deep brown crust forms and they lift freely off the cast iron. You can see I placed a little dimple in the center of each patty to prevent these from turning into softballs before flipping and allowing to cook for an additional 2 to 3 minutes. Then we're killing the heat, topping each with a slice of yellow American cheese, adding a dash of water to the pan for some cheese melting steam, and covering with a cloch. And now, finally, we're ready to assemble. It appears as though the burger starts with a pathetic leaf of lettuce, followed by the first burger, an onion ring, and a squirt of ketchup. Then, it's just a matter of repeating this process two more times. It's during this time that we can think about the 2400 calories that we're about to consume. Oh yeah, there's a fried egg on top. Make that 2475. This is after all the dinner for breakfast combo. Next up, we are proudly piling chili and cheese sauce at top our French fries, adding our top bun. And folks, I think we've done it. This is the Punchburger dinner for breakfast combo. Let's go ahead and use some magic to clear the table off. There we go. And as much as I want to try to just take a bite out of this thing, I think we got to get a cross-section. So, I'm going to do my best to not absolutely destroy this thing as I cut it in half. And as you can see, the ketchup between each layer was a little inadvisable because it ends up looking like blood. But whatever, I think it only adds to the sheer carnage of the occasion. And surprise, surprise, it's really quite good. I am and always have been and continue to be a supporter of onion rings on burgers. And look, it's just dripping grease and covered in cheese and chili, exactly how I imagined it. But to be honest, you guys, I don't think I can induct this into the Clean Plate Club. My blood feels thick and syrupy. Let's see if we can use the ingredients in this delivery from Thrive Market to make Chris Trager's famous salad dressing. Oh, Linda, in case you're interested, I brought my own dressing. You really can't be doing that. Oh, this is the last time. I promise. It contains extra virgin olive oil, a little bit of lemon, and a hint of turmeric. Sounds great. Okay, I'm definitely ready to feel healthier. In a small bowl, we're going to combine the juice of one large lemon, an equal part of high quality olive oil, and a teaspoon of turmeric. I better make it two teaspoons. This stuff is supposed to have great anti-inflammatory qualities. And after that burger combo, I feel inflamed. Simply tiny whisk until it forms a thick creamy emulsion that you can pour over the salad of your choice. I'm going with Chris's favorite food, plain lettuce. Let's give it a try. And the salad could use some other stuff in it, but the dressing is really, really good. And I can already feel it making me healthier. What are you eating? I call this turf and turf. It's a 16oz T-bone and a 24 oz porter house. Also, whiskey and a cigar. I'm going to consume all of this at the same time because I am a free American. The cigar's inside, sir. Fine. Hey, what's up, guys? Welcome back to Binging with Babish, where this week we are belatedly celebrating 6 million subscribers with the Turf and Turf from Parks and Wreck. Today, we are indulging in a 16oz T-Bone and a 24 oz porter house, which if I'm being completely honest, I thought was the same thing. Turns out not so. Over here on my right, your left, we have a T-bone, which has the characteristic New York strip just to my left, your right, of the T-shaped bone. But just to my right, your left, of the bone, a nearly non-existent filt minion, because t-bone steaks are cut closer to the front of the cow. Unlike the porter house, which is cut towards the center or rear of the cow, where the tenderloin is much larger, but if you go too far back, you're going to start getting a piece of top sirloin jutting its ass into your New York strip, bearing with it a piece of inedible senue. It's much tougher than the New York strip, and you end up paying more for less. So, ask your butcher to give you a center cut porterhouse, which is going to give you the most beefy bang for your buck. So, today I'm going to be cooking up the guy on my left. You're right. But enough talking about and stroking beef with our fingers. Let's cook some. First things first, we need to do as Jay Kenji Lopez alt commands and salt and rest our beef. So, onto a wire rack set in a rim baking sheet they go and covered with a generous sprinkling of kosher salt. They are. Then, we're letting these sit at room temperature for at least 1 hour. If you really want to go nuts, leave these uncovered in the fridge overnight, which is going to give you an extremely desiccated exterior and more deeply seasoned meat. Now, the one accur with which the Swanson appears to be eating his steaks are a fluffy pile of yellowy mashed potatoes. To me, that means Yukon Golds, which we are going to peel and cut into equally sized pieces, cover with cold water, bring to a boil, and cook for about 20 minutes or until completely tender. And a pairing knife cuts them like they're not even there. We're then draining the potatoes, returning them to the pot, and returning the pot over medium low heat. cooking them and stirring them around for about a minute, which is going to help drive off any excess moisture, giving us a less gluey result. We're then adding about a half a cup of half and half and maybe five tablespoons of unsalted high quality butter. For the record, this is for about 3 lbs worth of Yukon Golds. Now, we're going to mash them up most of the way. Take an opportunity to season liberally with kosher salt and white pepper. That way, we don't end up with bespckled potatoes. Mash them up the rest of the way. Taste them for seasoning and consistency. And there you have it. some very simple but very decadent mashed potatoes which we're going to cover and keep warm until ready to serve. Because as Ron so clearly states, food is not the only thing being consumed at this table. There are also cigars and whiskey, the exact make and model of which are not mentioned, but we know that Ron's favorite is Lagabulin 16, which tastes like a delicious tire fire. Woo! Yeah, that'll put some air on your chest. That is definitely Swanson appropriate liquor. So, with all of our sort of side dishes ready to go, we're ready to make us some steaks. First up for the porter house, we're heating some vegetable oil in a heavy cast iron pan over high heat for about 5 minutes until it's nothing short of straight up smoking. We are then patting our porter house as dry as humanly possible before poisonedly punking it into our cast iron pan, blasting it in the face with all the heat that our stove can muster for about 2 minutes until a deep dark brown robust crust has formed on the first side. We're then giving this guy a flip and repeating the process on the opposite side. Then I wanted to try preparing this in the style of bistca alflorentina. First I'm going to give the fat cap a little loving before killing the heat and standing the steak upright upon its tab bone. The bone is going to protect the steaks from the heat of the pan and prevent them from cooking unevenly as we place them into a 450° Fahrenheit oven. We want to reach an internal temp at the thickest point of about 120° F. Just enough time to deal with our T-bone. This time I am smoking out a carbon steel pan, which doesn't retain heat as well as cast iron, but it heats up much more quickly, which makes it perfect for a thinner steak like this that we're just going to sear and butter based. Same procedure as before. Just hit it over ripping high heat before flipping. Don't get too discouraged if you don't have a very even crust. We're going to fix that in post, so to speak. First, into the pan go a few cloves of crushed garlic and a couple sprigs of fresh rosemary and thyme. And then just a whole lot of high quality unsalted butter. I'm going with about 5 tablespoons. Once the butter is melted, which should happen very, very quickly. We're tipping the pan towards the garlic and the herbs and basting the steak. Here it is from another angle for illustrative purposes. And this is not only going to even out the color, it is going to deeply flavor our steak as it finishes cooking. Once the thickest part of the steak registers about a buck 25 Fahrenheit, we're removing it onto a warm plate and bathing it one last time in all that herby garlicky brown butter. An indisputably erotic sentence. Meanwhile, our vertically cooking porter house is coming out of the oven because it's reached 120° Fahrenheit internal. Yes, I cheated and used a thermometer. This steak costed like $100. And now, as I have so emphatically repeated over the years, we need to let these guys rest for at least 10 minutes before digging in. The T-bone I'm going to serve whole, but the porter house I'm going to carve up steakhouse style. That is removing the strip and the filet minion from the bone. Slicing and plating up in their original orientation. Peter Luger does a really bat method where they slightly undercook the steak, slice it, plate it up like this, and then throw the plate under a broiler. But I'm not trying to be too experimental today. So, let's save that for another episode. And there you have it, ladies and gentlemen. About 150 bucks worth of prime dry-aged beef, singing a delicate, distinctly American duet known as the turf and turf. All there is left to do is smoke them if you got them. Okay. All right. I'm being informed by my attorney that that's not a very good idea. So, I guess we'll save that for after dinner. You won't hear me complaining because it's time to dig into these perfectly cooked steaks. And all I can tell you guys about a prime steak swimming in herby brown butter is who needs drugs. This is what meat drunk feels like. I could feel every red blood cell coursing through my veins. The porter house was excellent on its own. So excellent in fact that I forgot entirely that I hadn't seasoned it with freshly ground pepper or big crunchy flakes of mold and salt or a generous drizzle of highquality olive oil. All things that I recommend that you do if you try this. And something I discovered is I am not Ron Swanson. I can't finish this alone. So, here's my best friend, attorney, and business partner, Sawyer, to Oh, looks like he was anticipating this to help me ensure that not a single bite of this feast goes to waste. Also, to make sure that I live long enough to keep making this show because this was in the end a celebratory meal. The channel recently hit 6 million subscribers. It hit a billion views. I just bought a house and it is 100% thanks to you guys. I'm so excited to show you the new kitchen, premiere some all new content on the channel, and make the absolute most of the ridiculous and beautiful opportunities that you've given me. Thank you guys so much for watching, and thank you for helping me reach 6 million subscribers. Ron, I am submitting this menu from a Pony Institution, JJ's Diner, home of the world's best breakfast dish, the four horse meals of the egg pork. Hey, what's up, guys? And welcome back to this, the final episode of Binging with Babish. to come out of the old kitchen. I'm all moved in to the new spot and have already filmed the subject of next week's episode, the meat tornado. But for now, we're taking a look at the four horse meals of the egg pork. Described in Leslie Nope's book as an astonishing onslaught of protein that includes a 12 egg scramble, bacon, sausage, ham, hash browns, chicken fried steak, and a giant tower of buttermilk pancakes. First thing we can start with is the flapjacks. This is a factory standard buttermilk pancake recipe. If you want to see how to make it, click the link in the upper right hand corner right now. Whisk it to a lumpy smooth consistency. Cover with plastic wrap and fridge for up to 24 hours. Plenty of time to address the many other horse meals of this egg pork. If we consult the book Pawne, the greatest town in America, you can see that there are two different iterations of hash browns. A mountain of scattered and shredded hash browns and five deep fried hash brown patties. So, we're going to start with the patties by peeling and chopping five medium russets into 1 in chunks, immediately dunking them into a cool water bath so as they do not discolor. This is also going to help wash off some of the excess starch, which is going to give us crispier potatoes. So, go ahead and drain these and then we're going to pat them dry on a few layers of paper towels. And then we're following a method for tater tots from master of all things crispy Jay. Kenji Lopez Alt, who calls for the potatoes to be par fried in 350 degree Fahrenheit vegetable oil for 3 to 4 minutes until lightly browned and cooked through. Once nicely blonde around the edges, we're going to fish them out and drain them on a paper towel set in a rim baking sheet. Then we're going to let them cool completely at room temperature about 20 minutes before processing them into a chunky paste. This fry fry again process is going to keep the interiors of our hash browns light and flaky rather than gummy and dense. So once they're nice and cool, go ahead and load them into your favorite food processor and hit it with eight 1 second pulses until all the potatoes have been broken down into little tiny chunks. Do this in batches to ensure that the potatoes are processed evenly and fish out any extra-l large chunks with your hands and your human intelligence. Once everybody's all processed together, we can season and form into patties. We're going to add two teaspoons of sugar, a few twists of freshly ground black pepper, a hefty pinch or about one teaspoon of kosher salt, and a tablespoon of potato starch, which is going to help give our hash browns structure and meaning. Once evenly mixed together, it's time to start forming them into patties. Hash browns typically are sort of oblong oval pucks designed to be quickly and easily mashed into your mouth hole. Now, we're going to freeze these bad boys for about an hour until they are frozen solid. This is both going to make it easier to retrieve and deep fry them. And it's also going to crystallize the potatoes molecular structure, making them more tender. Back into some 375° Fahrenheit oil they go for about 5 minutes until deeply golden brown and crisp. Drain them on a wire rack. And there you have it. Beautiful crispy, airy, flaky hash browns, which we're going to keep warm in a low oven while we make the million other things that we're making. The most excited for which I am is chicken fried steak, which starts with one of the cheapest and toughest cuts around. top sirloin, which we're going to gently coax into being tender using a whole bunch of little tiny sharp knives. This is a meat tenderizer used for making cube steak. A steak filled with hundreds, if not thousands of little tiny incisions, rendering even the most impossibly tough cuts of beef butter knife soft. After many spirited stomps, they look very much the same. But look more closely and you will see they have been bespeckled with lots and lots of little holes. And so now they're ready for breading. In my dry breading station, I have one cup of all-purpose flour, a ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
easpoon each kosher salt, and cayenne pepper, tiny whisked until homogeneous. Then, on the wetter side of things, I have one large egg, one teaspoon of baking powder, and a/ teaspoon of baking soda, which I'm going to tiny whisk into a slurry before tiny whisking in one cup of buttermilk. This is going to give our breading a nice light, airy texture. Once everybody on both sides is homogeneous, we're ready to start dipping our steaks. And since we're obviously not trying to skimp on the cholesterol, we are, of course, double battering. That means taking a prolonged dip in the dry stuff, shaking off any excess, heading over for a swim in the wet stuff, making sure that every crack and cranny is comprehensively coated, and heading back over into the dry, creating a bulky, craggly exterior, not unlike that of fried chicken. But fun fact, that is actually not where chicken fried steak gets its name. A known foodie and longtime franophile, Thomas Jefferson is actually credited with, I'm just kidding, it totally got its name from being a steak fried like chicken, which is exactly what we're going to do with it. Into some 350° Fahrenheit oil it goes, where it shall fry about 4 to 5 minutes per side until deeply golden brown and crisp all over. Use extreme caution when flipping because if you crack the shell, you're going to have a bad time. Drain it on a wire rack, keep it warm in a low oven, and rinse and repeat with any remaining steaks. And then the very key to the deliciousness of chicken fried steaks lies in the bottom of this pot. That's right. Remember all the brown sloppy gold from the KFC episode? All this deep fried gunk is the key to making delicious gravy. So, we are reserving as much as possible in the bottom of the pan along with about 2 to 3 tablespoons worth of leftover fry oil into which we're going to dump half an onion finely minced. We're going to saute that onion and all that brown sloppy goodness for 2 to 3 minutes until it's starting to soften and turn translucent around the edges. Add two or three crushed cloves of garlic and continue to sauté over a medium heat for about 30 seconds until fragrant. And then we're adding 1/4 cup of flour as our eventual thickener. Mix that in with the vegetables and let it cook for about 2 to 3 minutes until the raw flour smell dissipates. Then we are slowly whisking in about a half a cup of beeftock and the star of the show, one cup of light cream. Add it slowly at first, whisking constantly to prevent lumps. Add the rest and whisk frequently over mediumigh heat until bubbling and thickened. Once it starts to bubble, make sure you lower the heat so as to not scorch the sauce. When it's just about done, we're going to season with kosher salt, freshly ground pepper, and an optional sprinkle of cayenne pepper. We want it reduced and thickened to the point that it can easily coat the back of a spoon. We're also using a spoon so we can give it a little taste. Let's see how this is. Oh my god, that's good. Don't worry if it seems a little thin. It's going to thicken as it cools, but we want to keep it warm until we're ready to serve. Last bit of prep we got to do is shred our potatoes for our scattered fried hash browns. To make these, we are peeling and shredding three large russetss directly into a bowl of cool water. This again is both going to remove excess starch and prevent them from discoloring too quickly. Set those aside. And just like the very first episode out of this kitchen, we're going to finish on the flat top. There is no other way that a breakfast of this magnitude could be constructed. Once sizzling hot, we're going to treat the whole surface with a little drizzle of canola oil just to make sure that nobody gets too sticky. And then it's time to commence with the onslaught of protein. I'm starting with what looked to me like a pound of fried bacon fried up extra crisp the way that I imagine Ron likes it. I can just imagine him saying something about how floppy bacon is for frequent criers and bed wetters. We've also got three large slabs of ham that we're just going to heat up and get a nice crust on. Once everybody's nicely browned and fried up, it's time to evacuate them onto a plate, which we're going to keep warm in a low oven as we move on to phase two, the sausage and pancake phase. I've got some regular plain Jane breakfast sausage here, next to which I'm going to begin to dollop large buttermilk pancakes. These are going to fry about 3 minutes on their first side until they begin to turn pale and blistery around the edges. And let us all take a moment to remember that these are all being fried in bacon fat. Once the pancakes are flipped, they get another 2 to 3 minutes on the opposing side before being stacked on a plate and repeating until we got no pancake batter left. Pancakes finished. It's time to get this off of the spatula here. Come on, dude. Let's go. Join your pancakey brethren. And last but not least, we have our scattered hash browns and 12 egg scramble. The potatoes we're going to place in a clean kitchen towel and just squeeze the absolute dickens out of making sure that they are super dry to facilitate effective browning. But before they are headed over to the cook top, we're going to lightly season them with some kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Just the hits. Mix gently to distribute throughout and load them up onto an oil flat top. Then after flattening out with a large metal spatula into a potato patty, we're going to cover them with a bowl while frying on the first side. This is going to help the potatoes cook more evenly throughout. Then once the sausage has been removed onto the keep it warm plate, we're going to dedicate the new flat top real estate to the 12 egg scramble, which is exactly what it sounds like, 12 eggs scrambled. But we're doing ours in bacon and sausage fat. Just sort of scramble them around there. And once you have some nice big soft pillowy eggy curds, remove them onto a plate just in time to realize that you didn't time out your hash brown very well. But just pretend that you're at JJ's and you have heat lamps or something. Flip once nicely brown, cooking for 4 to 5 minutes per side. Once it's ready to go, flop it to top your hash brown pucks and get ready to serve. Everybody else is waiting, so why don't we go join the party? And what a party it is. Thousands of calories and hundreds of grams of cholesterol on parade alongside a single glass of orange juice and a single cup of coffee. I'm about to dig right into this sucker, but first I just want to say a few words. Well, folks, um, this is it. Uh, oh, I'm not in focus, am I? Hang on a [Music] second. Well, folks, that's it. That is the last meal to come out of the Soho kitchen. Um, I've lived here for two plus some odd years. I fell in love here. I wrote a cookbook here. All right. I lived a whole lot of life here and um it's pretty crazy to say goodbye. Oh, I forgot the sausage grape. Hang on. I mustn't forget the sausage gravy. Okay, that's better. Um so yeah, like I was saying, uh I'm feeling a lot of things saying goodbye. I'm I'm feeling scared. Um but uh like Ron Swanson says, when I eat, it is the food that is scared. So, I'm going to try to adopt that that uh that outlook. I'm feeling excited because um I've got a lot of big new plans for the new space, new shows, new people, new new everything. Um and uh I'm also feeling pretty sad. Like, you know, this place has been my home for longer than most places have ever been my home. Um, and uh, like Ron Swanson says again, uh, there is no sadness that breakfast breakfast food cannot cure. Um, so I'm gonna I'm going to live by those words and I'm going to dig into this breakfast food right now. This needs butter. Oh, hold on. I got something to my last splash of Lagalin 16. Last little bit. I spilled it on the eggs. That's okay. Okay, that's not a little bit, that's a lot of bit, but whatever. We're celebrating tonight. Thank you guys so much for sticking with me. I owe everything I have to you. I owe everything more than I ever dreamed I would have. I owe it all to you. And like I said in my book, I'm going to spend the rest of my life working to earn everything that you've given me. So, here's to you guys. Thank you so much for sticking with me. I'm going to devour this breakfast food right now. particularly this chicken fried steak cuz I've been thinking about this alling day. Hell yeah, dude. This guy's going to the clean plate club tonight. A calza. It was a Kelzone. A Kelzones betrayed me. Crust on the bottom, filling crust on top. What am I describing? A pie. No, but you're in the right zone. The localal cow zone. Zone. You know what? I like calzones. What the hell's wrong with this guy? Hey, what's up, guys? Welcome back to Binging with Babish, where this week we're taking a look at the many shapes that calzones take in the world of Ben Wyatt. I know I promised you guys a JoJo episode in a recent Twitter poll, but I couldn't get a hold of some necessary ingredients. So, keep an eye out for that next week. First up in our trio of Cowzone stylings is Czone apple pie. We've made a number of apple pies on this show, so I'm just going to kind of breeze through the instructions. Food processor, 300 gram of all-purpose flour, 2 tbsp sugar, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, 225 g unsalted cold cubed butter. Process until the butter is the size of peas and gently combined with 68 tablespoons of ice water gently mixed into a ball of dough wrapped in plastic wrap and refrigerated for at least 1 hour. 2 lbs of honey crisp apples, corded, peeled, and thinly sliced. Place in a large bowl and toss with the juice of one lemon to prevent oxidation aka browning. In another bowl, combine 3/4 of a cup of sugar, 1 and 1/2 tbsps of cornstarch, 1/4 cup of brown sugar, 2 tsp cinnamon,/ teaspoon of ground ginger/ teaspoon ground allspice, 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves, a zest of one lemon, and a teaspoon of kosher salt. Tiny whisk to combine. Perfect. Add to the sliced apples and toss until evenly coated. Take a moment to ponder how lucky you are that it's your job to make apple pies. Taste the apples for seasoning. And then it's time to roll out the pie dough. On a well flowered surface, we're going to pound and then roll out our pie dough to a rough oval shape. Using half that oval to line a glass pie plate, filling the pie shell with our apples and their accumulated juices, brushing down the opposing edge of the pie dough with egg white to seal. Covering with the opposite side of the oval, trimming, crimping, venting, brushing with egg white, and sprinkling with deer sugar. Placing in an oven preheated to 500° Fahrenheit, reducing the temperature to 375 and baking for 45 to 55 minutes. And there you have it, the Cowzone apple pie, which despite my overclocked voice over, I thought would be nice with some coffee, perhaps served up out of the plate, calzone style. First, let's take a look at a rare apple pie cross-section. Fascinating. Sliced into somewhat more manageable yet still unwieldy long, skinny slices and dig into one of the best and strangest apple pies I've ever made. The filling is warm and syrupy and spicy. The crust flaky and crisp even on the bottom. But it's our first and last sweet calzone. Our next two destinations are savory, and for them both, we're going to need a simple tomato sauce. Something else we've made countless times on this show, so once again, we're going to breeze through it. Into a highwalled sauté pin goes 2 tablespoons of olive oil that we're going to heat over medium high until shimmering, in which we're going to sweat half a small finely minced onion for 2 minutes, sautéing two crushed cloves of garlic and two tablespoons of tomato paste for 1 minute before adding a sometimes squirty 28 oz can of San Marzano tomatoes. crushing up, adding a springrig of fresh basil. Partially covering, lowering the heat and simmering for about an hour and a half until thickened and deepened in flavor. Optionally pureeing to a finer consistency using an immersion blender. Seasoning to taste with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper and finishing with a glug of extra olive oil. Okay, back to normal kits because we're venturing into as yet unexplored territory, namely the low calzone zone, which despite being about the same in calories but higher in fiber, I think is going to call for a whole wheat crust. So, we're going to follow this recipe from America's Test Kitchen that calls for 8 and 1/4 oz whole wheat flour combined with 5 1/2 oz of bread flour, 3/4 of a teaspoon of instant yeast, and 2 tsp of honey in the bowl of a food processor. We're just going to lightly process those together until they are thoroughly combined. Then, we're going to perform the very clever trick of thoroughly kneading our dough using the food processor. First, we're going to measure out 1 and 1/4 cups ice water, which we're going to pour into the processor's feed tube while the machine runs. This is going to bring our ingredients together into a ball of dough. But as soon as it does, stop the machine and let everything rest for 10 minutes, which is going to help with water absorption. Then we're adding 2 tbsps of olive oil and 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of kosher salt and letting our spinny cuddy machine run for 1 minute straight, during which time it's going to knead our dough better than any human being could, with the exception of maybe Ron Swanson. He's got some dough kneading mitts. I'm sure he would hate that I said that. Now, this dough is very sticky. So, to make it more handleable, we're going to olive oil both our mits and work surface. turn out our pre-calzone goo out onto the counter and give it a few cursory kneads to make sure that there are no dry spots. Then we're going to use the dough's stickiness to pull it into a taut ball, which we're then going to plop into a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and allow to ferment in the fridge for at least 18 hours and up to 3 days. Not only is this going to drastically improve flavor, this is a very high hydration dough, around 80%. So, it's going to make it much easier to play with. After a couple days in the fridge, we're taking it out of the bowl and dividing it into twain. Both pieces of which we're going to stretch into tot balls. I feel like I'm saying that a lot recently. Place on a lightly oiled rimmed baking sheet, lightly oiled themselves and loosely covering in plastic wrap. And that's where the testicular similarities end. Because if your balls do this after an hour and a half at room temperature, see a doctor. Extract the first dough ball, keeping the other undercover of plastic wrap, and coat it thoroughly on both sides with allpurpose flour. From this point on, we're treating it pretty much like pizza dough, aka your grandfather's calzone, which again sounds like a testicular thing. Anyway, we are patting, stretching, and passing knuckle over knuckle this dough until it reaches about a 12-in round. At which point, we can commence not to topping, but filling with what, you ask? Well, healthy stuff. I'm going to sauté some broccoli and some olive oil. Add some red peppers, maybe some baby spinach, baby bok choy, and mustard greens. Just ask yourself, what would Chris Trager put in a calzone? Part skin mozzarella, which is kind of like worse mozzarella, part skin ricotta, which is kind of like wallpaper paste. Our sauteed veggies, and what the hell, another layer of parts skin mozzarella. If you're going to have a healthy thing, you might as well have too much of it, right? That's how being healthy works. Anyway, I'm brushing down the outer rim of the dough with plain old water and gently folding this pizza into a much more complicated calzone. Crimping the edges shut with a fork. And then as an additional preventative measure against blowouts, I'm going to decoratively fold the crust closed or at least decoratively to the best of my limited ability. And there you have it, the Paneian pariah, the calzone. Onto a lightly flower, dusted pizza peel it goes. And onto a pizza stone in a preheated 550° Fahrenheit oven. It will be pllopped until it emerges burnished and browned and done. We're going to let this guy sit undisturbed for about 5 minutes to let those fillings calm down a little bit before slicing in half and taking a gander at that cross-section. Now, one good thing about low-fat ingredients, they're much less watery than full fat muts and regott. So, we end up with a pretty good-looking calzone, which despite being a lowcal calzone, I'm going to divide into four pieces for easy sharing. Because this whole thing clocks in at just over 1,000 calories, but half will run you a much more reasonable 528 calories. So, not exactly what I would call lowal, but about as lowal as calz zones can go. And I got to say, really quite good. The crust is nutty and wheaty and tender. The fillings are plenty flavorful and cheese stretchy. I'm going to go ahead and call it a perfectly healthy lunch for two. On the decidedly less healthy end of the spectrum are the mini calzones, which Ben described as a savory pastry. So, I'm going to make another batch of pie dough. This time with no sugar. Rested in the fridge for an hour while I shred up some full fat mozzarella, which is much easier to shred if you let it chill in the freezer for about 20 minutes, which I did not do. And then, in Ben's own words, the cowzones betrayed him by giving him food poisoning. So, I've got some Italian sausage here well past its prime. Let's just give it a sniff test to make sure. Oh yeah, that is ripe. I'm just kidding. Of course, this is some pre-cooked chicken sausage that I thought looked kind of wrong. Anyway, we are retrieving our savory pastry dough from the fridge, turning it out onto a well-fled surface, and pounding and rolling it out to a large round about 4ish cm thick. Then, we need about a 4 and 1/2 in biscuit cutter. This lid from my protein powder will do nicely. And we're going to use that to cut this dough into miniature rounds. Then, from there, it's just a matter of filling and deep frying. That's right, deep fried pie dough. So, into each of these little rounds, I'm going to place a tiny dab of sauce, a little pressed together mound of our mozzarella cheese, a little dollop of full fat regott, and a couple pieces of our pretend expired sausage. Then comes the delicate act of folding. Once again, I'm going to wet down the outside edge to act as a sort of sealant, tucking our fillings gently into the little pocket and pressing the edge down to seal. You have to work quickly at this stage because the butter is going to begin to melt and we want to maintain as many of those layers of butter as possible before deep frying. Once again, I'm going to attempt to place a decorative crimp on the outside with mixed results. And this guy is ready for the deep fry. In a cast iron skillet, I'm going to heat about a quart of oil to 350° Fahrenheit and drop these guys in for about 1 and 1/2 to 2 minutes per side. It's at this time that I'm going to pray to whatever God will hear me that my fillings don't explode out the side of my calzones because this is the last of my frying oil. But the water and crimping sealant held true and my empanadas, I mean calzones, emerged looking perfect, almost exactly like the ones that we saw in the show. Once you're done frying up the rest of your delicate dough pockets, it's time to let them cool off before trying them. Otherwise, this might happen. a boiling hot cheese blowout that you're not even going to notice is burning your skin because these things taste so darn good. M ouch. After letting these guys cool off for about 5 minutes, we can examine them a little more closely. As you can see, pie dough has responded extraordinarily well to deep frying. It is light and flaky and crispy, and it's filled with melty cheese, piping hot sauce, and seasoned meat, exactly the way I imagined them when Ben described them. After trying these dectable little appetizers, it's hard to imagine why Ponians are so opposed to calzones. Then again, these people live and die for a place called Ponchburger, which actually sounds pretty good. Maybe I should try that next episode. Well done, Tommy. Is that bacon on your turkey leg? They call it a Swanson. Wow. Freddy spaghetti. I got rules. Hey, what's up, guys? Welcome back to Binging with Babish, where this week, after visiting Disney World on my new show, Being with Babish, I'm hungry for a turkey leg and leave it to Ron Swanson to wrap one in bacon. But first, we have to negotiate this whole turkey because it's March and grocery stores aren't selling turkeys, so I had to special order this guy. And I'm going to show you how to extract its legs and wings. First, on the wings, we're cutting through the skin down to the joint, separating the bones, and running our knife in between. Easy peasy. And it's an excellent warm-up for removing the drumsticks because it's the exact same concept only harder. Try to find the joint and start making radial cuts around towards it until you reach the two bones in question. Then try to twist the leg until they separate. Run your knife in between and sweet, sweet freedom. One helpful thing to look for is this little strip of white fat that runs along the joints in most poultry. Just try to make some long even cuts along that fat and you should have no problem finding the joint. We'll deal with the rest of this turkey later because for now we have to prepare a cure. Not that kind of cure. This turkey is totally dead. Know a meat cure out of 1 and 1/2 cups of distilled water, 1 2 3 4 and 1/2 tesps of kosher salt, 1 and 1/2 tesps of proud powder number one, which is a kind of pink curing salt, and 1 2 3 4 and 1/2 tbsp of dark brown sugar. Go ahead and tiny whisk those together until they are completely dissolved. Get your face right down in there. Make sure that there is no particulate left, but not too close because frog powder is toxic to humans. but not in this application because only a little tiny tiny bit ends up in the meat. Now, I've got the turkey divided in half into two Ziploc bags. So, I'm going to measure out exactly half of our cure and put it into each bag because we are [ __ ] with science right now. Then, you might notice I have the tops of my bags folded down. That is to prevent crosscontamination. And now, I'm going to press all the air out. Seal it up, making sure that as much of the meat comes in contact with as much of the liquid as possible. Then we're placing these in a bowl and refrigerating for 24 hours, turning every 12 hours or so before we hop in the car and make our way out to the suburbs where my buddy Steve has a smoker that I don't totally know how to use. So Steve, why don't you come on in here and show us how to use it. I'm going to do my best Steve impression because he's not here to do the voice over. Hi, my name's Steve. What I'm going to do is place these apple and cherrywood chips that I've had soaking for half an hour onto these hot charcoals, which I've also had preheating for about half an hour. And then I'm going to replace the grate. Have my friend Andy drop in the ambient temperature probe. Close it up and let the heat stabilize to 325° F, adjusting the vents as necessary. There you go, Andy. All ready for your turkey. Thanks, Steve. I'm going to start by probing the thickest drumstick at its thickest point. And if you have very thick cut butcher bacon like this, you want to wrap it now. If you have thinner grocery store style bacon, you want to wrap it in about half an hour or once the joints register about 140° F. Close it up, crack open a beer, and watch half an hour fly by. Use this time to work on your other impressions like your Ted Dancing. Hey, Ted Dansen here. Taking a break from being a goddamn sex machine to show you how you would wrap turkey legs in thinner bacon after 30 minutes of cooking. I kind of recommend doing this anyway because the skin underneath the thick cut bacon doesn't really get that same mahogany color. Anyway, back over to you, Andrew. Thanks, Ted. Wow, this is a star-studded episode. Anyway, now that my neighbors probably think I'm insane, let's grab our turkey drumsticks, plate them up, and let them rest for about 10 minutes before digging in. Mostly because you're going to want to spend that 10 minutes marveling at the color of these things. They're like meaty bottles of Cabernet wrapped in burgundy strips of hardwood smoked happiness. Curing the meat adds a distinct flavor. Smoking it accentuates and amplifies it. And then we wrapped it in bacon. And the wings aren't bad either. Sorry I didn't mention it before. Pulled these off after they've reached 185° F. Now, if you will excuse me and Steve, we have to introduce these into the clean bone club. And then I collapsed my tripod and drove back home so I could mess with the rest of this turkey, which I'm going to peel the skin off and then remove the breasts from by making long, clean cuts down the side of the breast bone. I'm going to do the same thing with the thigh meat by cutting and scraping down the side of the thigh bone until I've gotten all of the remaining dark meat extracted. Now is a great opportunity to pay your future self a huge favor and throw this carcass into a stockp, make some amazing turkey stock, and freeze it. Your November self will thank you, and your current self will thank you if you cut all of the breast and thigh meat into 1-in cubes, place them on a parchment line baking sheet, freeze for 15 minutes or until they're firm around the edges," and grind up in a food processor. This is way better than any store-bought ground turkey and will make some serious Trager turkey burgers."""

ke5AdmQBBbg,"fried garlic chicken, but the sauce he uses whole garlic cloves, bananas, and well, it just looks really, really good. I'm going to start by sautéing 24 whole cloves of garlic. Blitz them until smooth. Blitz together whole bananas and syrup. So, we're going to make a sauce by adding in 1 cup of soy sauce, half a cup of brown sugar, 1/2 cup of honey, and 1/2 cup of rice wine. Add in a tablespoon of sesame, and stir. Add in 1 tbsp of cornstarch slurry. Now, this sauce can go directly into our puree. For our chicken, I'm going to cut up two lbs of boneless skin on chicken thighs. I'm combining 2 and 1/2 cups of AP flour, 1/2 cup of cornstarch, 1 tbsp of salt, 1 tbsp of MSG, 2 tsps of garlic powder, 2 tsps of onion powder, 1 and 1/2 tesps of baking powder, 1 tsp of turmeric, 1 tsp of curry powder, 1 tsp of hot paprika. Add enough water to make this pretty thin. Dump our chicken in, frying at 350 for about 5 to 7 minutes. We're going to take our sauce, put that into a walk at high heat to reduce.

b-C8mNqvujQ,whoa is that a grilled cheese deluxe from cheeers yes it is how did you manage this I bought it with money nice hey you know what would go good with these sandwiches funny internet videos ooh that's kind of meta hey what's up guys welcome back to binging with babish where this week I'm double dipping into the same show two weeks in a row because I'm curious can we improve upon the classic combination of butter two slices of whiteed bread and some yellow American cheese to make the ultimate grilled cheese or a grilled cheese deluxe Friday was National grilled cheese day and I guess it got me in the mood so to speak so first up we need a control group which is a classic yellow American white bread Vermont crary butter grilled in a non-stick pan cheese stretch hell yeah dude but how do we make this a grilled cheese deluxe let's start with the bread white bread is definitely the only way to go because the least healthy option is always going to be the tastiest one but I'm going to try to a few different lubrications plain butter butter mixed with a little bit of mustard full fat mayonnaise and light olive oil I'm just going to toast these guys up one at a time in a plain ungreased non-stick skillet and we're looking for aesthetic but mostly flavor here we obviously want a deep Brown rich and savory crust but we don't want to steal the spotlight from the star of the show the cheese so let us bring in the taste testers they are one Sawyer Carter Jacobs my business partner and best friend extraordinaire and Vincent cross the newest and tallest Edition I to The babish Culinary Universe their opinions were split on these different toast lubrication methods Sawyer was pure olive oil and Vinnie was all about butter and I got to say I side with Vinnie on this one butter is the one and only true way for grilled cheese there was however one other toasting application I wanted to try which was straight up cheddar grated onto and toasted into the outside of the bread the consensus here is that it was delicious but it was too greasy and moreover it was Overkill this is grilled cheese it doesn't need any help what it does need however is cheese lots of cheese so I've got 18 different kinds here that I'm going to try including but not limited to Sharp Cheddar mild cheddar Reet havarti Swiss Grier aged guda young guda parmesan Bri toio mozzarella blue gorgona provolone goat and Monterey Jack plus whatever else I had kicking around in the fridge with three mini grilled cheeses at a time my taste testers have returned to tell me what's what Vinnie was very concerned with the tensile strength of each cheese but both were most interested in the flavor color and aged Funk but apparently none of of us were concerned about our cholesterol levels but I just kept telling myself I'm conducting these experiments in the name of science plus they both know that they're responsible for their own healthc care plans so really it's their fault if you think about it anyway we toiled on into the night trying every form of melted cheese betwix buttered toasted bread and once Vinnie stretched Every Sandwich to its limit it was time to start trying Blends cuz no way was any one cheese going to cut it it was going to be about defly mixing together salty sweet stretchy melty Savory oily and funky into the perfect grilled cheese blend first up was monterey jack guda and mozzarella which I learned that I didn't put enough cheese in so we didn't get much of a stretch but this was going to be about flavor and the consensus was that it was a grilled cheese so obviously it was good but it needed some work so we moved to aged yellow cheddar Grier and swiss and while they like the color of this one better the flavors were too strong Vinnie was however satisfied with its stretch next up I was pretty sure I hit the jackpot age cheddar Grier a 9-month-old guda and Par on for a little extra bite naturally it passed Vinnie's rigorous stretchiness test and the flavors were the clear winner but there was one big problem this was a greasy greasy sandwich and that's because aged cheeses do not melt in the same way as young heavily processed cheeses this slice of yellow American dropped directly into a non-stick skillet melts perfectly and evenly and utterly without mus or fuss try this with a 2-year-old parmesan however and all of your melty cheese dreams will be shattered that's because the older cheese gets not only does it lose more and more moisture some kind of science happens with its casine proteins and when you melt it you're left with a ton of oil to solve this problem we're turning to J Kenji Lopez alt who instructs us to hydrate 1 tblspoon of gelatin and 1 tblsp of water before grating our top four cheeses together I'm going with 4 oz of sharp cheddar 3 oz of Grier 3 oz of young goua and 2 oz of Parmesan for a total of 12 oz that we're going to set aside while we bring half a cup of evaporated milk to a boil killing the Heat and and whisking in our hydrated gelatin until it is fully melted into the mixture then we're going to return the pan over low heat while we add in our cheese you'll notice that my heat is not on because I'm stupid and I did this wrong it still worked it's just going to be a lot easier if you do this over low heat while you apply an immersion blender to the mixture in an effort to make it as smooth and homogeneous as possible then ideally you want to lay it down onto a plastic wrap lined baking sheet and spread it out as thin as possible instead I'm going to press it into a plastic wrap lined ramkin and mold it into a cylinder that I can then cut into slices 4 hours later and once my cylinder has solidified sorry we are removing it using the plastic wrap unwrapping it and slicing into our quote unquote processed cheese product it's really pretty spooky to eat because it has the same texture and consistency as American cheese but it tastes like Grier and cheddar and all that good stuff that we put in there and it passes the melty test with flying colors becoming incredibly soft and melty and malleable without pissing grease all over the place and it's got all the flavor and texture that I could possibly ask for in a grilled cheese all it needs is the olives now there's a grilled cheese deluxe that lives up to its name and the olives were actually a pretty nice touch they were like a refreshing acidic bite after all that richness and cheese but I still didn't feel like we were done and I knew I wasn't going to feel that way until I made my own bread I've done this on the show before click the link in the upper right hand corner right now if you want to see how to make your own sandwich bread at home but just to give you the Bree through I'm combining 400 mL of water one packet of instant and yeast 650 g of allpurpose flour 50 g of sugar 5 G of salt and 45 G of unsalted butter in the bowl of a stand mixer needing for 5 to 7 Minutes letting rise for 45 minutes in a covered oil Bowl punching down and placing into a loaf pan Loosely tented with plastic wrap and letting rise for 45 more minutes or until doubled in size brushing down with melted butter and placing into a 400° Fahrenheit oven for 25 to 35 minutes until deeply golden brown removing from the loaf pan placing on a cooling rack and making sure that the internal temperature registered is about 200° f letting rest for 1 and 1 half hours or until completely cooled that was easy I definitely overpredicted it out of the park with this one which I really needed because I don't think I could eat any more grilled cheese um maybe just one [Music] more the ultimatum is a cheeseburger stuff inside a cheeseburger with two deep fried cheeseburgers is buns and then we add our special ketchup that we get from the Himalayas anyone who doesn't eat one is a chump hey what's up guys welcome back to binging with babish where this week before we get started I want to congratulate shika plate for winning the eat what you watch contest with her incredibly accurate Recreations of foods from breath of the wild I also want to congratulate the four runners up all of you guys will be getting a copy of my book and thank you to the hundreds of other people who entered this contest you guys all made some really amazing food and now it's time for me to make the ultimum starting with the so called Himalayan ketchup I'm going to make a ketchup with spices similar to a Indian cundi that starts with grated Ginger grated turmeric sliced Bird's eyed chili three cloves of grated garlic just a little itty bitty tiny hint of cinnamon a much bigger hint of chili powder and about half teaspoon each of mustard seed ground toasted cumin ground toasted coriander seed and Nigella seed and then into a few tablespoons of olive oil we're going to dump our painters palette of flavor we're just going to saut those for a couple minutes minutes until fragrant and trust me it gets very fragrant this stuff smells amazing and then we're going to De glaze with just a little bit of malt vinegar recenter our induction cooker with the camera and add a 28 Oz can of crushed tomatoes I chose tomato cundi because well it's from the Himalayas and because it's very similar to ketchup in that it has Tomatoes spices brown sugar and vinegar adjust each of these to taste until it tastes ketchupy and then put it on the back burner for simmering for at least an hour hope you're enjoying the all new back burner Cam and after an hour you will have a nice thick paste like this that we're going to smooth out in a high- powered blender simply dump it in the jar puree for 3 to 5 minutes and then to make this extra smooth and ketchup like I'm going to run it through a fine mesh Sie and just to make sure that this is extra Himalayan we're going to season it with pink himalay and salt before fruitlessly trying to get it into our squeeze bottle and now it's time to make some burgers we're going to start by making the burger within a burger this is just a straight up cheeseburger pan fried hit with salt pepper toasted buns you know the drill really doesn't matter how well you make this burger because it's going to end up really really gross because we're putting it inside of another Burger which is just a straight up bad idea but I am not here to argue I am here to recreate we're going to pinch this big old thing closed and bake at 350 for about 15 to 20 minutes or until cooked through in the meantime we're going to deep fry our other burgers for some reason this one I was actually kind of curious about because I never heard of deep frying Burgers but it just ended up being crispy leathery patties I can't really recommend it anyway what I can recommend is this amazing ketchup it's the one great thing to come out of this experience and I'm going to slather it all over everything our Burger within a burger is out of the oven so we're going to place it on top top it with our other burger bun and of course get that crosssection this tastes about as good as it looks so I think we can do better this is called the ultimum so why don't we start by adding other kinds of meats I'm going to start by making a cheese and bacon stuffed burger for our main Burger I feel like I'm saying burger too much let's call this one Jeffrey we're going to Simply pan fry Jeffrey making sure those edges are good and sealed because what we do not want to experience is a Jeffrey blowout flip carefully after seasoning with salt and pepper and then on the back burner cam we're going to make Smash Burgers for our burger bun things I'm going to top these with pepper jack cheese for a little bit more flavor variety and just when you thought it couldn't get any better here comes some fried pastrami let's start by assembling our auxiliary Burgers on simply toasted buns with our Himalayan ketchup Place Jeffrey in between the two of them make sure he's good and stable top him with some Himalayan ketchup and our crispy fried pieces of the stami top of with the final auxiliary burger and again it's cross-section time one that features more flavor in variety and no buns soaked in meat juice this turned out absolutely amazing especially the Himalayan ketchup I hate homemade ketchup and this stuff really blew my mind now Chef AJ this is an ultim meum in fact I think you are a chump introducing our new every meat burrito it's got every meat beef bacon Crow G Bon chle Puffin crust Nick and B red and every other [Music] H tastes like chicken hey what's up guys welcome back to binging with babit where this week we're celebrating 2 million subscribers the only way that seems suitable by making the every meat burrito from Regular Show it wasn't easy to procure every meat feasibly available to the US consumer so I thought it'd be fun to take another look behind the scenes of binging with babish because this turned out to be potentially the most expensive and timec consuming burrito ever made test test test testies always hilarious all right let us Embark upon this meat Journey tips for hunting meat call ahead of time cuz we're driving all the way down to Brooklyn today and we are going to get some exotic meats if we can ever get there because it's new this is New York City and all these people are animals on the road yeah go ahead go sure you had a red light like 20 minutes ago all right so now we're a little closer to park slope and uh or maybe like Hill or something like that I don't really know where we are I should look and tell you after I've checked we're going to uh Los Panos Meat Market where they're known for their very exotic meats and this is where we're hopefully going to get some elk some Caribou some rattlesnake some some some alligator and uh really round out our every meat burrito let's go check it out I know you guys have some really exotic meats like uh rattlesnake and stuff like that I need every weird meat that you guys have Che so is this this is all the Exotic stuff here all right let's stock up do do you have like a basket or something I can load up oh my God this is way better than I thought all right let's get started here got camel emu elk bison ostrich kangaroo it's a lot of kangaroo python filet horse rattlesnake oh we got wild boar alligator bull fries correct me if I'm wrong but is this not a testicle it is bull testicle of course got probably I don't know 20 different kinds of meat in here we're stocking up what's the grand s76 $576 this by a wide margin the most expensive episode of Ulta thanks for thanks for doing all that appreciate it have a good one thank you guys that guy was a stone cold Pro then like he he didn't bad ey was like okay yeah Ratt snake python full testical what else do you want we had to get tortillas so we were heading to miio which is a tortilla factory not only do we want quality tortillas we need a big tortilla because there's so many Meats going into this uh this burrito we're to need room for all of them my full-time job before binging with Bish was my full-time job was as a visual effects artist in the commercial industry my whole job was um all the little things that you're never supposed to notice like if an actor was wearing a shirt with a Nike swooosh on it I would get rid of that or if they had bags under their eyes I would lighten those up and just sometimes they' it'd be crazy things like can you change the color of that guy's shirt we don't like blue and pink stripes we want blue and orange or something like that so just all the all the things in commercials that you're never supposed to noticed I was in there messing around I either have Fraser going in the background Star Trek next Generation and music-wise I it's a it's a collection of electronic Funk uh hip-hop uh you can actually listen to my a playlist that I made called bangers with bish search for it on Spotify uh and you can listen to my playlist of preferred Tunes to hear when I cook I got into cooking because my mom taught me how to cook at a very early age some very simple things like chocolate chip cookies and stew and uh uh that just sort of implanted a love of food and cooking and cooking for family and friends in deep in my heart and I can't get it out she pass away when I was very young so it's a very nice way to just sort of remember and feel closer to her and uh I'm very happy to play a part in getting other people to try it out too cuz that's what she did for me I had no idea I used to live like two blocks that way I had no idea that there's an apparently amazing Tortilla Factory right here called miio um you need uh tortillas you need big big tortillas the biggest tortillas uh flow tortilla the biggest one you got for burito yeah going get them out the back we're getting the tortillas out the back oh yeah that's what I'm looking for big tortillas uh maybe just a few keys can I just a c Keys okay [Music] when you have this much frozen meat there's only one way to defrost [Music] it it's it's hot cold we want it cold SE 12 hours or something ah so anyway that is the journey that led us to this point where we are now cutting up all 27 different kinds of meats and grinding them into a burrito friendly State making this not only the most labor intensive episode of benging with babish ever but maybe the most expensive burrito of all time we're talking about almost $600 worth of exotic meat all different kinds of stuff ranging from chicken to beef to Pork Lobster shrimp fish duck lamb turkey bison Cornish game hen Goose feasant quail rabbit squab venison boar alligator and slope Caribou elk ostrich Turtle rattlesnake and Kangaroo oh and bull testicles of course what every meat burrito is complete without bull testicles and you may notice that I'm also adding bacon here because it was one of the very few Meats specified by the gim Bros that I could actually get a hold of and even this relatively small constituency of the meat Kingdom smells like death the only spices that seem to make sense are a bit of chili and lime in the hopes that they will somehow make this cinus chorus of four flavors somehow work together and while this is a great opportunity for me to practice my burrito rolling skills something I've admittedly never done before today I could tell just by the smell that this burrito was doomed from the start even the smell aside crumbly overcooked ingredients and chewy undercooked ones I suspect rattlesnake and python prevented me from swallowing even the first bite I'm sorry you all have to see this but this is the price that we pay for science I tried to Jazz it up with some standard burrito ingredients black beans montere jack cheese salsa and sour cream but to no avail this mixture was full of wild game and meats that were meant to be simmered for hours to bring out their tenderness and subtlety all of which came together to make a burrito that was at once crumbly and chewy gamey and not much else all that I know is that we can do a whole lot better what about instead of an every meat burrito and every pork burrito something that includes chichones garitas too alpastor and of course bacon we're starting with chichones a piece of pork belly that we're going to cover in baking soda and salt and refrigerate on a rack for 2 to 24 hours during which time we'll start to make our spice paste for the alpastor tacos I'm boiling five each guilo and Pasa Chile for about 15 minutes or until they're nice and soft at which point I'm going to strain them and Reserve their boiling liquids wearing seemingly pointless protective gloves while I scrape out the seeds from each and every pepper returning them to their soaking liquid once they've been deemed seedless then we're adding these peppers and their soaking liquid to a high powered blender along with a little Shake of onion powder a few cloves of fresh garlic a little Shake of cumin powder a generous pinch of Mexican oregano and a spirited sprinkling of freshly ground anato seeds once we blend this on high for about 1 minute it's going to create the smooth and flavorful spice paste in which our al pastor pork is going to live speaking of which we now need to break down a pork shoulder into slices no thicker than a/4 of an inch thick we're trying to mimic the conditions under which alistor is normally created which means thinly sliced pieces of pork rested for at least 2 to 3 hours in our al pastor marinade massaged briefly and covered in tin foil kept in the fridge while we prepare the other por sign players in our Porky parade next up is carnitas a kind of pork shoulder that has been brazed in orange juice and spices and then shredded and fried into until crisp first up the brazing wherein we are squeezing a whole orange cut into quarters and then adding the squeezed orange flesh to the meat mixture along with a few haved Serano peppers a whole onion roughly chopped a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a healthy seasoning of kosher salt and freshly ground pepper we're also going to add four fresh bay leaves and six whole loaves of garlic haved I've never made carnas before and it seems to be a dish that relies heavily on picking up flavors from its surrounding aromatics so I'll be curious to see what it ends up tasting like we're going to give it a little massage to let those flavors get to know each other and I almost forgot two cinnamon sticks underneath a tightly foil wrapped package that we're going to raise at 275° F for 3 and 1/2 hours in the meantime let's get our Chicho nice ready we're cutting our pork belly into half in pieces that we're going to place in a walk and barely cover with water bringing to a simmer and skimming off any scum that comes to the surface over the next 2 to 4 hours after which all of the water will have evaporated and all that will be left will be the fat rendered from the pork belly in which the pork belly itself is going to fry how barbaric is that yet how crispy and delicious set aside while we remove our Caritas from the oven removing from the fruit and spices and shredding to a shredded consistency which we are going to set aside and refrigerate until needed because in the meantime we need to make pork al pastor we are borrowing a relatively ingenious tip from tasty videos placing some bamboo skewers in a piece of pineapple and using them to layer our meat into a sort of makeshift schwarma that we're going to place in a 350° F oven right up against the side wall of the oven rotating frequently to get that sort of charred schwarma effect as for the rice fact of our burrito we're simply taking three cups of boiling water adding two squeezed limes of little Shake of cumin and combining that with two cups of long grain white rice in a casserole tightly covered with aluminum foil that we're going to bake for 20 to 25 minutes at 400° fhe in the meantime we've got our pork El Pastor which we're going to shave off much like a schwarma setting aside while we prep our other burrito ingredients we're going to start by crisping up our chicha dones and Carnitas maybe in a little bit of bacon fat because we're filling frisky before spreading down our base layer of white lime rice and a few slices of our chizo sausage after for got to mention this before but this is an every pork burrito followed by our nice crispy chicharones and Carnitas and honestly I would have included poop if not for alpastor which has a very similar marinade and frankly a more impressive presentation that we're going to top this off with some Monterey Jack cheese some salsa some sour cream and now that is what I call a burrito oh I'm sorry I almost forgot the bacon this is after all the every pork burrito which I would venture to say is even meater than en the every meat burrito so if there's one lesson to be taken away from this experience it's not the amount of meat it's how you treat the meat huh I think I'm going to have that put on a t-shirt only once every thousand years does an eating challenge appear with the ability to blow everyone away the excellent challenge is that challenge 12 eggs chili cheese biscuits and a fruit ball finish in under an hour and your party eats for free hey what's up guys welcome back to binging with babish where this week we're celebrating 3 million subscribers by taking the excellent challenge before we take a crack at this so to speak I wanted to give you guys a look behind the scenes of my new kitchen and apartment if you want to see the regular episode skip to about the 2 minute 45 second Mark otherwise let's join me up on the roof thanks me so we're up on the roof of my new apartment my studio kitchen my home office and as you can see a lot of things have changed since we had a million subscribers and a lot of things have happened that would not be possible without all the your incredible support uh over the past 2 years so thank you so much for subscribing for watching the show and for just being an amazing audience I really appreciate it I love making the show for you guys and I've got a whole bunch of exciting new tools to make the show with so let's go take a look at them let's head back downstairs so this is the office where I sorry this is the office where I edit all the episodes of binging with babish and I do the voiceover and this is my best friend and business partner Sawyer who does all the hard legal work and uh occasionally cleans up my mess this is my bedroom where I iron my apron before shooting every episode and often several times during and th and this is the all new binging with babish kitchen which I'm super excited about it's been way easier to make the show I don't know if you saw the last kitchen but it was pretty cramped tiny little railroad apartment Up In Harlem now I've moved downtown and I got a six burer Vulcan stove it's been so great to shoot straight across this with this camera got multiple C cameras I've upgraded to a nice Cinema lens here on the A7 s's uh three big work surfaces we've got uh the big booze block kept this from the last apartment this will always stay with me this is the table upon which binging with babish was birthed so this kitchen has really cool fridges and freezers they're restaurant sort of drawer style ones which is really great makes everything very accessible and uh ton of room in these four guys plus I get to keep all my Selzer right in here then if you come on over here you'll see the uh state-of-the-art trash can which uh check this out open can I never use that feature and then as you can see I've got a bunch of these ninja flame 4K monitors and Rec and field recorders here there's Tim see Tim I say hi Tim so now if you don't mind I think we should uh get down to business of making the egglin challenge let's eat some eggs okay so first things first we got to make us some chili now we've made a lot of chili on this show so I'm just going to make a super Baseline standard no power windows chili I'm going to start by dicing one Spanish onion one green pepper and four cloves of garlic then over on the stove we're Browning the ground chuck simply heat over High flame until you get some nice brown stuff and some delicious fond on the bottom of the pot and those that are fond of me know that I am fond of fond drain off all but a little bit of the beef fat and sweat the onions and peppers within it once those are nice and soft add the garlic a couple tablespoons of chili powder a good Shake of white pepper and a little Shake of cumin let those flavors just get to know each other for 30 seconds to 1 minute just to toast up the spices and get the garlic all aromatic before adding 1 can of crushed tomatoes along with 1 to 1 and 1/2 cans worth of water and our Brown Ground Round I'm also going to add one can of kidney beans and the Adobo sauce from one of those cans of chipotle peppers and Adobo sauce and a teaspoon each smoked paprika and oregano stir this guy over medium low heat for about an hour taste testing every now and then so you see how the flavors develop over time until you've got a nice thick basic chili look at that gorgeous and now onto an element that I'm much more excited about making biscuits into a bowl while measuring 675 G of flour 2 tbsp of baking powder 1 tbsp of baking soda and 1 teaspoon of table salt or 2 teaspoons of kosher salt sift those all together into an inadvisably small bowl and then we're cutting up into tablespoon size pieces some butter fresh out the fridge we want this as cold as possible for the same reason we want butter cold in puff pastry we don't want it melting until it gets in the oven try doggedly to make your small bowl work before inevitably putting it into a larger bowl and use two butter knives or steak knives to cut the butter into the flour we want to keep going until the butter is the size of small peas at this point we are adding 2 cups of butter milk and beginning to fold together using a rubber spatula we don't want to over mix or over knad our Dough because we want to maintain those little chunks of butter to get all those desirable flaky layers so less need your dough and more coax it together convince it to form a cohesive ball that we're then going to refrigerate for 10 minutes before rolling out and cutting into the desired shapes in this case biscuit shapes make sure you dust your cutter with flour and cut swiftly because we want clean cuts down the side of each biscuit any pinching will inhibit rise place these on a parchment line baking sheet and give them a generous brush o butter you can also hit the tops with some flaked sea salt but either way these guys are going into a 425° f oven for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown and Flaky we're going to place these on a wire rack to cool for 10 to 20 minutes but these are best eaten warm so let us make quick work of breaking down our fruit I'm not going to bore you with how to cut up melons we got some watermelon cantaloupe and honeydew melon that we're going to cut down into about 1 in cubes until we've accured a sum total of 5 lbs of fresh fruit this alone would be a challenge to eat all in one sitting but let's add some eggs to the equation the eggs in the show are described as an omelette with peppers and mushrooms so we're simply slicing up a bunch bunch of peppers and mushrooms and getting a tablespoon or two of butter nice and foamy in a large cast iron skillet over medium heat once the foam subsides we're going to add our mushrooms along with a generous pinch of salt this is not only for seasoning but also to help the mushrooms give up all their mushroomy moisture so once the mushrooms have dried out a little bit we're going to add the peppers and sauté the whole Affair until everybody's nice and soft you'd probably want to add some garlic or onions or something but I'm trying to be pretty literal with this challenge so we're just keeping it to mushrooms and peppers and now for the Big Show the dozen egg omelette I'm going to start by heating up both olive oil and butter in the bottom of a heavy cast iron pan beating together my eggs and dumping them in I'm going with medium heat because I want to partially cook these eggs the whole way through before letting them set so I'm going to keep these boys moving with a fork until curds start to form kind of like you do for a French omelette this is going to help make our eggs less tough you want to keep doing this until you can start to see the bottom of the pan when you move the fork around this is the point at which we let the eggs cook and let a sort of omelet crust form after about 2 minutes of this I'm going to dump in our fillings and fold this guy shut Case Closed sorry and now at long last it is time to assemble onto a large platter I'm going to deposit our egg monstrosity or eggcity top it with four full cups of our chili I was very very surprised to find out that I had made just enough good thing otherwise this might have turned out I don't know appetizing we're topping that with two cups of shredded American cheese and a slightly more reasonable two Buttermilk Biscuits and there you have it the excellent challenge there's only one more vital ingredient they I didn't mention on the show there we go keep those guys at the ready and start the timer now I am not what you'd call a competitive beater but this doesn't look so bad and it actually tastes pretty good this chili isn't going to win any awards at county fairs but it's pretty solid and the eggs are properly cooked and there's lots and lots of cheese very few things to complain about so in the end it was pretty easy to blow through the whole thing with just 6 minutes to go and if you don't believe me let's play back the whole thing sped up so you can see that there are no cuts and that I finished the entire thing and I'm just ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8Nr2xxHM9kk,000 Scoville unit range so before we negotiate these Peppers we need to apply prophylactics to our hands eyes and countertop once all the important stuff has been safeguarded it's time to start chopping up peppers simply remove the stem and then cut the rest of the pepper into 1in segments you want to end up with about a pound of peppers total I'm using mostly Habaneros for their heat if you want a milder more flavorful sauce reminiscent of Franks or Tabasco just use Fresno Peppers into a blender they go along with four cloves of garlic and maybe a cup of white vinegar it's going to seem like not enough but these Peppers liquefy pretty easily and so on low speed at first we're going to start blending these guys until they can blend no more and we need to employ the help of a big old blender stuffer thing and then we're going to blend on high speed for at least 1 minute until the mixture is completely smooth at which point we are going to evacuate into a non-reactive container cover Loosely with plastic wrap and allow to sit out at room temperature for 3 Days in order to ferment you should see little bubbles rising to the surface indicating that the sauce is fermenting which is going to deepen its flavor and complexity next up we are straining it through not too fine a mesh strainer we want some of those pepper solids to make it through so it thickens the sauce but we want to catch all the big stuff like this then to both thicken the sauce and mellow out some of the harsher raw pepper flavors I like to cook the sauce a little bit maybe 10 to 15 minutes at a bare simmer before finally tasting for seasoning and oh boy this stuff is hot a little salt to taste and a pinch of sugar will help round out the flavors a little bit and I'm also going to add some MSG because MSG tastes good and so now it's time to start dealing with our chicken wings after rinsing and thoroughly patting dry we are placing them into some vegetable oil which we have heated to about 225° F which might seem like an awfully low temperature and that's because it is we're going to slowly carefully cook these at 225 for about 20 minutes effectively making chicken wing com fee in this method developed by Jay Kenji Lopez alt after 20 minutes our wings are going to emerge pretty pale and flabby and not appetizing to the human eye but don't worry because we're just getting started these guys are going to hang out on a cooling rack for at least 1 hour at room temperature or overnight in the fridge at this point we're going to let our oil cool and filter it into our even bigger Dutch oven where we're going to heat it to a screaming hot 400° F add the cooled chicken wings and fry for 10 minutes during the first 2 minutes of which they are going to be very sticky so try to pull them apart if they stick together and at this point you might be saying this is an awful lot of work for chicken wings but this yields the crispiest juiciest most tender and flavorful wings I have ever eaten even after saucing they stay crispy forever we're frying in small batches so as to prevent sticking so once each batch is done place the wings on a cooling rack set in a rim baking sheet and keep in a low oven now I know that blue cheese dressing is not allowed in this challenge but I have guests coming over and I want to be more hospitable than those Backwoods weirdos so into a medium Bowl goes about a cup of mayonnaise about 3/4 of a cup of sour cream a little sprinkle of garlic powder about a tablespoon of white wine vinegar a healthy sprinkle of kosher salt and a few twists of freshly ground black pepper I also like to add about half a teaspoon of white sugar oh that's too much and a little squeeze of lemon juice and that's it perfect blue cheese oh yeah we need to add blue cheese maybe about four crumbled ounces of the blue stuff you might want to buy the pre- crumbled kind because this gets a little bit messy mixed together and you have the only possible accompaniment for buffalo wings Ranch you can go yourself W sorry my Heritage just its ugly head we're going to keep this covered and refrigerated until ready to use so the flavors can meld and now it's on to Sauce our Inferno sauce is looking about the right consistency and compared to some Frank's Red Hot on the right it's looking pretty orange and mean but now for the all important taste test the Frank's Red Hot tastes like Frank's Red Hot and The Inferno sauce tastes like well is hot a flavor because that's mostly what it is but outside of that it's nicely fermented and it's got a slightly more floral flavor thanks to all the Habaneros toss the wings in the sauce as immediately as possible after frying to sure sauce adhesion toss really high up in the air so each Wing gets a little bit of hang time cuz it's fun for them and plate up like a big old pile of chicken wings and since I was unable to make a show accurate mutated ghost pepper sauce I think the least that I can do is set These Wings of flame so into a sauce pan goes the wings along with a good glug of sauce which we're going to get nice and hot and bubbly then we're going to kill the Heat and add some stuff that we can set on fire I went with bourbon because I thought bourbon chicken wings sounded good but in retrospect I would go with something a little milder or something that would compl imp the flavors like tequila or vodka so now here to join me is my buddy Shawn Evans with whom I'm going to play a game of which one is the hot one Shan which one is the hot one I'm going to go out of the limb and say that's the hot one God damn it you're good so anyway before we eat I'm going to let all this alcohol burn off plate these guys up and extend a courtesy to you that you do not extend a guests on your show in the form of carrots celery and blue cheese red carpet treatment I feel welcome and while the bourbon Wings did not turn out super good the straight up sauce was actually really tasty what do you think on delicious and the wings are warm do you not have warm Wings on your show uh yeah we totally do all right and lastly do you think that these qualify as Inferno Wings these are not Inferno Wings you want Inferno Wings then that means you got to come on my show your show my show right now right now let's go let's go that stuff is vile bringing back memories yeah of college and of trying to impress my friends whoa did I just hiccup I haven't hiccuped in like seven years so I'm hiccuping I swear I haven't hiccuped in like seven years this is magical for me are you crying listen I'm not immune to it you know I'm just in here battling through that is so exciting what are those oh no those apple frers with double GL by mistake double glazed we'll take them actually I got to throw them out bro cuz they're not safe for human consumption we'll give you 10 bucks uh you want those for hero to go hey what's up guys welcome back to binging with babish where this week I just hit 5 million subscribers this is not the 5 million subscriber special that's coming soon but tradition dictates that I make something from regular show and that clip always gets me in the mood for Apple does so most of the recipes I found on the internet are a quick baking soda based Fritter but since our heroes purchased their duts from a doughnut shop I wanted to make a real deal yeasted apple fritter so we're going to start by combining 1 and 3/4 cups of milk heated to 110° fhe with 2 and 1/4 taspo active dry yeast 1/4 cup sugar and 2 tbspoon of honey in the bowl of a stand mixer give it a little tiny whisking and let it sit for 10 minutes after which it should have gotten nice and foamy to this we're going to add three eggs lightly beaten as well as our all-purpose flour 22 and 1/3 o to be precise you might notice that I only measured the flour by weight rather than volume and that's because it's the only ingredient that can vary wildly when measured by volume unlike say unsalted room temperature butter which we're going to cut one and a half sticks into before fixing dough Hooks and administering a beat down on our dough we're going to start nice and slow to make sure the flour doesn't fly everywhere and then we're going to mix on medium high speed for 6 minutes scraping down the sides of the bowl once halfway through until we are met with an Ultra Soft Ultra sticky dough at this point you might be saying oh my God I need to add flour but why don't you just trust me for once in your life scrape down the sides of the Bowl One Last Time cover with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature for 1 hour just enough time to negotiate our apple filling for which we're going to need four large Granny Smith apples now there's a number of ways to peel an apple but only one tests your cooking prowess your finger tenderness your empathy and your inner strength and that's to try and peel it all in one single spiral can I peel this apple in one uninterrupted ribbon of course I can I'm like a warrior poet with a vegetable peeler I might not be able to say throw or catch a football or an Apple for that matter but when it comes to peeling I am your Champion anyway no matter how you peel an apple we want to then core it and cut it into half2 in bite-sized chunks we're then going to toss these in a medium bowl with a juice of one lemon which is not only going to flavor but prevent the apples from browning as we make our way over to the stove top into a large nonstick pan goes half a stick of unsalted butter which we're not only going to melt over medium heat we're going to lightly brown it once you see the milk fats separate and start to change color add the apples give them a toss before adding a whole bunch of brown sugar maybe like half a Cup's worth along with some spices 1/4 teaspoon of cloves half a teaspoon of ground ginger a teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon of allspice simmer tossing occasionally for about 4 to 5 minutes until it's nice and thick and gooey and complete and the apples are just about cooked through we don't want our filling to be too liquidous however so we're going to thicken with a teaspoon of corn starch whis together with 1/4 cup of warm water cook for an additional minute until super thick and then set aside to cool completely because as you can see it's been an hour and our dough has nearly doubled in size but it's still super duper sticky so I'm going to coat our work toop with what I would call an uncomfortable amount of flour scrape every little last bit of dough out of the bowl and then we're going to convince it to form a rectangle by stretching it into a rectangle on top of which we're going to dump our freshly cooled apples as you can see I put mine on a rimmed baking sheet just to get them to cool a little bit faster and then we're going to spread them out across the dough and fold the dough over on itself like a pamplet effectively laminating the apples and their accompanying sauce into the dough we're just going to coax that back together into a ball make sure that the apples are evenly dispersed Place back in the bowl cover and let rise again for 1 hour at room temperature until redoubled in size then out onto a again generously flowered worktop we are dumping this messy doughy Appley kind of thing a bunch of apples are going to spill out don't worry this is a natural part of the Fritter making process just liberally flow the top of the dough and then we're going to roll it out to about a 1 in thickness and then bust out your favorite biscuit cutter with which we shall cut rounds out of the dough just keep cutting till he can't cut no more and then we're going to pull away the scraps from outside the rounds place the cutout fritters onto a well flowered baking sheet and then we're going to roll the scraps back out and this is such a soft dough that it's not going to make tough Donuts once you roll it once everybody's all cut out we're headed over to the stove top where we've got a quart and a half of vegetable oil heated to 375° F into which we're going to drop our Donuts they're also a little thick so I'm patting them and stretching them out a little bit before dropping them in the oil because they're going to puff up significantly after about 90 seconds of cooking we're going to flip them once let them cook for another 90 seconds and then once they're golden brown and crisp all over we're going to evacuate them onto a wire rack in a rim baking sheets so they can drip dry rinse and repeat with the remaining fritters until everybody's cooked and then finally it's time to talk about the star of the show The glaze alls you need to make doughnut glaze is a whole lot of powdered sugar and just a little tiny bit of milk tiny whisk with conviction until it's nice and smooth and no lumps remain and then we're ready to get to Duncan pun intended as that nice Jamaican doughnut shop employee specified these were double glazed apple fritters so I'm using a very thin glaze here to ensure that we get a nice smooth shiny coating on our Donuts but pops was able to see his reflection in these fritters so they definitely need a double dunk once the first coat has hardened we're going to dunk them again resulting in perfect dut shop style apple fritters but I was curious to see if I could get the same results with a thicker glaze so with maybe double the powdered sugar and the same amount of milk let's see if we can get similar results in one step and the results were more like a convenience store honey bun which you're not going to hear me complain about I love honey buns and while it doesn't have the mirror Sheen that we were looking for for the show accurate Recreation it makes a very handsome Fritter and no matter how you glaze it these are some picture perfect apple fritters light and fluffy on the inside golden brown and crisp on the outside with plenty of pockets of warm spiced apples dotted throughout its twisty interior it makes you wonder how anyone could ever want something like a whole wheat dut that is until you eat like three of them for your cooking show and things start moving in slow motion and with that I'm off to the gym after a quick nap [Music] [Music] how about a victory drink I call it the Mississippi Queen Mississippi Queen why do you call it that oh you'll find out hey what's up guys welcome back to binging with babish where this week we are celebrating 8 million subscribers we're recreating the Mississippi Queen from Regular Show

the episode shall we or let's let Bucky say it come here let's get back to our regular schedule programming [Music] all right that's enough kitten cuddling for now let's make us a practically poisonous Mississippi Queen a good drizzle each chocolate sauce and soy sauce and then not quite a full jar of mayonnaise but more than I'm used to in my cocktail a generous helping of kimchi a generous pore from a jar of pasta sauce a bag of what looked to me like muscles at the time but in retrospect I think might have been clams but I ordered muscles I really don't think it's going to make that much of a difference a plate of assorted Sushi and Sashimi don't forget the chunk of Wasabi and maybe a little bit more pasta sauce and that's really all there is to a Mississippi Queen this thing is supposed to be so spicy that it makes rig morai and Benson tripped face so I think it needs a little bit of help what we have here is a bottle of Mad Dog 357 number9 plutonium the world's hottest hot sauce at 9 million Scoville units and costing $109 for 1 ounce basically this is just a 60% capsacin extract roughly 3,"000 times hotter than tobasco sauce and more than four times hotter than the hottest hot sauce I've ever eaten the last stb so I'm understandably only putting in about a half a teaspoon which alone will have the spice equivalent of 50 bottles of Tabasco sauce anyway once we've got this delicious looking mixture all mixed up we need to only add a cocktail umbrella and a straw and there you have it the Mississippi Queen time to give it an admittedly difficult taste as it's a rather thick mixture and kind of hard to pull through the straw but eventually I got myself a mouthful and not only did it taste like seafood Burger Special Sauce it was as you might imagine B meltingly hot there are just so many reasons that I can't recommend making this at home the gross expense the gross waste the gross grossness but the best thing about it is the unbearable heat so now more than I've ever meant it when I've said it before I think we can do a whole lot better this seems to be a play on a bloody mary so I'm going to start with 32 o of high quality tomato juice add a little bit of chili sauce for that slight shrimp cocktail Vibe a little rice vinegar in honor of the dearly departed Sushi a little clam juice to replace what I in retrospect realized were probably clams a glug of soy sauce and because it's going to play nice with all these flavors a little fish sauce and honestly let's bring back the kimchi if we liquefy it it's going to taste really really good in a Bloody Mary I think plus it just wouldn't be the Mississippi Queen without some stuff floating in it in that Spirit let's peel and grap maybe 1/4 cup of freshly grated horseradish and in what I feel like is another fitting homage to the Mississippi Queen some Wasabi we got a lot of Briney Seafood flavors going on here and I think this stuff's going to play real nice then we turn to the matter of heat and I am not eating that Mad Dog 357 again so to bring a decent amount of heat and a good amount of flavor we've got a whole seated and chopped habanero plus a little Shake of celery salt because why not some kosher salt and some freshly ground pepper and Blitz until relatively smooth you don't want to have to chew your Bloody Mary and there we have it our base Bloody Mary mix which I got to say really solid star it's like a bloody Mary and a melada had a baby and it was raised in a sushi restaurant but it just doesn't have the psychoactive punch that I got from watching that scene for that I think we need mushrooms what kind of mushrooms you ask well let's to say that they're skinny they're dried and they're expensive because they're just porini mushrooms or are they they are or are they I'm kidding they are don't breathe the mushroom dust after you've ground them up into a fine powder pass it through a fine mesh SI to catch any big old chunks and blend it into your Bloody Mary mixture now you might be asking me why are you doing this outside of a mushroom joke well dried porini mushrooms are a great way to amp up the Umami and depth of flavor in our Bloody Mary and as I'm finding out they are really good at making geometric patterns look more interesting last up this beverage is going to provide the perfect environment for some actual Seafood content here I've got some shrimp that I'm going to peel and then devain by placing a shallow cut down the back of the shrimp and removing its digestive tract yummy the scallops we're going to Simply sear in a high smoke point oil like grape seed oil not moving over medium heat for a solid minute and a half until a beautiful brown crust has formed and then butter pting like a steak for maximum luxuriousness cooking for about 3 minutes total or until the thickest one registers 130° F at its thickest Point set the aside on a paper towel while we do our shrimp which we could steam or poach but I'm just going to saut them very quickly on each side flipping occasionally so they don't burn and likewise cooking to an internal dness of 130° F set those aside cuz it's time to assemble now the only tributes missing to our original cocktail are mayonnaise and chocolate two things I'm not really thrilled to bring to the situation because I think we got a pretty good Bloody Mary going on here so I'm going to do a rim of Aleppo pepper and freshly grated chocolate which I'm going to Tiny whisk together and use the Mayo to AIX the mixture to my intended cocktail glass Rim which is as close to my drink as Mayo is going to get and it actually tastes surprisingly not terribly awful that being said it's time to finally have a drink we're breaking from the cartoon in a big way and adding a couple measures of this clear Russian liquid which is the only reason that exists to drink a bloody mary I understand virgin dairies or padas but Bloody Marys come on pouring are prepared marry mix over top giving a little stir with an elongated cocktail spoon making sure everybody's all good mixed Mi together before beginning the rather complicated garnishing process I'm going to use a metal straw then we need some kind of vegetation so I'm just going to go with a celery stalk and our Seafood must be skewered before being tucked in with the rest of the bunch and then once we got two shrimp and two scallops on there they're being nestled like a Savory brunch time bouet into our awaiting drink and even though this is pretty handsome Bloody Mary as is we're going to add one final touch the little blue cocktail umbrella and there you have it a cocktail I would gladly order after a night of one too many party pets but how does it taste well once I'm able to find my straw I can tell you that it's the very model of a modern Bloody Mary it is Rich and spicy and savory and it plays real nice with the included Seafood in fact I don't know why more Bloody Marys don't come with seafood it's practically a cocktail sauce cocktail so thank you guys so much for helping me celebrate hitting 8 million subscribers and for your kindness and generosity and support and I will see you next week [Music] if you present your VIP card you get access to our exclusive new sandwich the pork picnic slow cooked baked beans Hardy Co SL and three different types of barbecue P pork M now now that's lip licking good hey what's up guys welcome back to binging with babish where this week we're taking a look at the pork picnic sandwich from Regular Show which gives us the opportunity to try out three different kinds of pulled pork a classic Memphis dry rub with Kansas City style sauce a South Carolina vinegar barbecue and the Mysterious Alabama white let's start with the Memphis style dry rub courtesy of amazingribs.com we got 3/4 of a cup each dark brown and white sugar 1/4 cup of garlic powder a/ cup of sweet American paprika 2 tbsp ground ginger 2 tbsp onion powder and 2 TPO Rosemary powder this along with 2 tbsp of freshly ground black pepper creates Meatheads Memphis dust an amazing all-purpose barbecue dry rub which you might notice is missing one essential ingredient salt that's because in barbecue meat has all different shapes sizes and surface areas so you want to season your meat first with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper for two reasons first so that you can make sure that it is not over nor under salted and second so that you can effectively dry brine your meat salting it letting it sit overnight in the fridge is both going to deeply flavor the meat and help with moisture retention so we're starting by removing any large pieces of excess fat before generously coating on all sides and surfaces with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper let them sit overnight in the fridge and for our Alabama and South Carolina pork that's going to be it they're headed on to the smoker wearing nothing but SNP but our Memphis style is getting a generous rub down with our Memphis dust you can pat down the pork with a little bit of water to help things that here if necessary just make sure that everything's coated as evenly and as thoroughly as possible so there we go all these guys are headed into the fridge overnight before heading onto the smoker which gives us time to talk about what sets the South Carolina style pork apart a vinegar-based mop sauce we're combining a cup and a half of white distilled vinegar tablespoon of salt 2 teaspoons crushed red pepper a tablespoon of sugar and a few dashes of your favorite hot sauce TI and whisk that together until everything's dissolved and then we're headed over to the smoker I got my Trager preheated at 225° fhe using a mixture of Hickory Maple and Cherrywood and now we're going to leave these boys to smoke for 16 hours during which time we're only going to disturb them to mop our South Carolina style pork you want to paint the meat down with the mop sauce every hour or so permeating it with spicy vinegary goodness I know 16 hours seems like a long time but you will be rewarded with the tenderest juiciest Puli a partiest porki pull pork you've ever dared dream of so I know I've been jumping around a lot let's review our three different styles thus far on your left my right we have the Memphis style which was hit with the Memphis dry rub before smoking on your right we've got the Alabama style which at this point is just salt pepper and smoke and then in the center we have the South Carolina style which was hit with salt and pepper and then mopped every hour with our vinegar mop sauce we're going to let these guys hang out under cover of foil for about 45 minutes while we make the rest of our sauces first up a general purpose Kansas City style barbecue sauce I'm sautéing together half a small onion and two cloves of garlic that I'm grating into some vegetable oil letting those sweat a little bit before before adding 1 tbsp of chili powder letting that toast together with the onions for about 30 seconds before adding my wet stuff starting with about 1/2 cup of good oldfashioned ketchup this can be adjusted as per your tastes half cup of bright yellow ballpark Style mustard two 2 and 1/2 tbspoon of apple cider vinegar 1 tbsp black strap molasses 1 tbsp wer sauce 1 tbsp of Honey 1/2 cup of light brown sugar I know that seems like a lot of sugar but barbecue sauce is sweet a few dashes of our favorite hot sauce and a few pinches of our dry rice bring this guy up to a simmer and let him cook for about 15 minutes until nice and thick and adjust to your taste that's what makes barbecue sauce special is it too sweet add some vinegar hot sauce and ketchup is it not sweet enough add any of the 10 kinds of sugar that we added just make sure it's cooled completely before bottling and selling on Kickstarter and now for the enigmatic Alabama white sauce we're starting with 1 cup of mayonnaise 1 teaspoon each horseradish and mustard 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper half2 cup of vinegar the juice of half a lemon and one or two cloves of grated garlic these guys come to together to make a rich bracing beguiling sauce which once seasoned with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper tastes really quite good and I'm excited to see how it's going to play on our sandwich and with that it is time for the Blessed ritual the pulling of the pork we're starting with the South Carolina stuff it shouldn't be complete mush but it should absolutely be tender enough to do this by hand you should also see a deep pink smoke ring around the outside of your meat once the South Carolina stuff is shredded and all the extra fat and Bones discarded we are tossing it together with a very very very very generous amount of our vinegar mop sauce our Memphis dry rub is getting a squirt of our Kansas City style sauce and the Alabama stuff is getting the Alabama stuff and there you have it folks three distinct excuse me three distinct Regional styles of pulled pork the Memphis style dry rub in Kansas City sauce is probably what most of us associate with barbecue sweet Smoky and Saucy The Addictive South Carolina style has a lovely Spicy vinegary Bite to it and the rich bracing sauce of the Alabama white is honestly not for me but I think it's going to be great on a sandwich speaking of which I completely forgot about put the baked beans and Co SLA that I need to make so for the baked beans we're Browning up a half pound of thick cut bacon that we' cut into bite-sized pieces removing it once all the fat is rendered out and it's nice and crisp and then 1 tblspoon of the remaining fat we're going to sauté a half small chopped onion deglaze the pan with 2 cups of water scrape up all that good stuff off the bottom of the pot that is where all the flavor lives then we're adding 2 tbsp of brown sugar 1 tbsp of black strap molasses 1 teaspoon of dry mustard powder and of course the titeler ingredients two drained 15 o cans of navy beans and a bay leaf for good measure add our bacon back to the party and this guy's either going to simmer over low heat or bake at 300° F for 2 hours until it's nice and thick and has a texture reminiscent of baked beans season liberally with kosher salt freshly ground black pepper add more sweet if necessary and that's all there is to it for our coal SLO we're doing a vinegar-based Carolina style SLO 34 of a cup apple cider vinegar 1/4 cup of water 1/4 cup each vegetable oil and sugar 1 taspo celery seeds 1 t spoon Dijon mustard big old pinch of kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper then we're going to go ahead and Tiny whisk this together until everything's dissolved and it forms a lovely dressing then for a nice rainbow effect we're using half a head of thinly sliced purple cabbage a half head of green cabbage two grated carrots and one small thinly sliced onion toss this all together by hand there really is no other way to do it and there you have it a nice vinegar-based SLO now all there is left to do is assemble our sandwich those who know me know that I only toast the inside of my sandwich this both protects the roof of your mouth and the sandwich itself from all of its gooey fillings speaking of which I'm starting with a layer of baked beans and then topping with each of our regional styles of pulled pork Alabama white followed by South Carolina followed by Memphis Style with extra Kansas City barbecue sauce a big old pile of coal SLA and then it's time to top it up the VIP only pork picnic sandwich in question was garnished with a single Olive I'm going with two both for structural stability and so I can make it look like my sandwich has two little eyes looking around the room wondering what's going on oh no sorry little buddy but we do need a cross section and what a cross-section it is just about everything I imagine when I think of the words pork picnic but has it taste and as you can imagine it tastes really really good when you take all these delicious things and shove them together it's going to taste nice the distinct style of each barbecue kind of gets lost in the cacophony of flavor and I'm honestly not digging baked beans on a sandwich but those are about all the complaints I can muster up now if you'll excuse me I'm off to have my cholesterol checked a""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
d be rice and it could be leftover Ramen cooked with cocktail sausages which is honestly quite delicious I've learned that cocktail sausages have now been an official addition to the marage to Ramen list okay now with the other half of that leftover Rosé Ramen stir fry mixture we made before we're going to make something a little bit more fun I'm going to take these just have them in a bowl and just crack in two eggs mix it together till I have somewhat of like a eggy batter I'm going to spread this mixture out and Fry this in a pan with a little bit of oil I'm going to top this with a heavy handful of shredded cabbage because we also have a lot of cabbage left over and then some bacon strips right on top I'm going to flip this by transferring this to a plate and then flipping it back over cuzz otherwise the cabbage and bacon would spill everywhere then I'm going to cook this for low heat approximately 10 to 15 minutes because the bacon does need a lot of time to crisp up and that's a lot of cabbage we got to heat through then I'm going to flip this back just so you guys can see the crispy bacon and then we're going to flip it back over and slide it onto a plate because we have now made ramen okonomiyaki which is a play on a Japanese pancake like treat that is often made with cabbage bacon sometimes stir fried noodles if it's a different style or just a pancake like batter and I think this one would work pretty well we're going to top this with a nice brushing of bonomi sauce a sweet sour Tangy soy based sauce as well as a drizzle of cupim mayo as well as scallion and I present to you our rokono Miyaki actually surprisingly delicious way more than I thought it would be something about the again cocktail sausages and the ramen seasoning and the sauce and the C it was it was so good I wanted to keep eating it but we you know again wanted to not get too full but I could not help myself and was stealing bites of this between the other ones so yeah this was a great way to transform this leftover ramun it it was higher than my expectations here's another scenario let's say you finish eating your Raman or your Ramen and you have this you know salty MSG filled broth and you don't really want to drink the soup but you feel bad about throwing it away and you don't know what to do well what you can do is you can take couple of eggs depending on how much you have left I Ed to crack them in broth directly just whisk it up and put that in the microwave for about 1 to 3 minutes and once you bring that out you top that with scallions and you have a version of steamed egg Chinese steamed egg or Korean egg sule or Japanese chaan Mushi there probably a version of this in many many cultures but the great thing is you just turn your left of a Ramen broth into a delicious relatively healthy I would say snack and maybe you're so hungry after you're Raman but you don't want to open another pack this is exactly what you can do and you also could just use up some eggs but I guess saying that right now might might be different cuz eggs are kind of expensive okay now we also have some leftover Mac and ramen from earlier I'm going to take this potato wrap them in a wet paper towel and go ahead and microwave this for about 5 minutes while we cut up some of this cheese in chunks on the bag it said that we had some Waka cheese from another Sho so we're going to be using that today it's kind of a nice stringy melty cheese then I'm going to take the these cheese chunks throw them in a bowl with our Mac and ramen throw in our peino and once our potato is done in the microwave I'm going to throw that into a bowl just kind of mash that up and throw in another potato that we had also going in there so we have two I guess mashed microwave potatoes then we're going to just mix this entire thing together combining Both Worlds of potato and cheese and starch and just mashing that together pretty intensely because I want to break up the texture of those ramen noodles and kind of turn this into one homogeneous starchy cheesy mixture I'm going to throw in some scallions to kind of add a little bit of acidity and bite to this and a little bit of cream just a splash thank you Tony just cuz it was looking a little bit dry now we have this cheesy potatoey Ramen Scallan mixture we're going to make some Croquettes do that just going to take a heavy handful of this take some of those cheese chunks I separated on the side from earlier put it in the middle and shape these into nice largely round discs these aren't going to expand or anything they are going to stay the same so it's okay that they're in these form then to bread them I'm going to press them into some panco directly no flour no egg just because I think the Japanese style Croquettes uh use a lot of the panco crispiness and I think the potato and the cheese would fry it pretty nicely once all the sides of each croquet have been coated I'm going to drop these now to 350° oil H definely I know I put a lot of cheese in there it seems like we went really hard on the cheese because there's a lot of cheese instantly melting out and kind of frying up on the floating on the surface I got to take that out to make sure it doesn't burn um yeah so as you can see our first one kind of came out with a lot of stag ties and a lot of stalagmites I don't know which one is which but there's probably both of them in this one next one um this one came out even worse there's probably way too much cheese on the surface and my gut says that just pressing them in a PCO was not doing enough to seal it in but the good thing is we still have two Croquettes left so I'm going to go back over to the prep table crack an egg beat it up and pour that over the remaining two croquets to kind of coat them before putting them back into the ponco for a double bread this one is going to provide a really strong layer of effective shielding and once we put that into the oil and Fry this up we can easily tell from both color and texture this is definitely looking a little bit more correct and more like the Croquettes that I have seen that one probably still has a little bit of those burnt cheese from the previous one but the fourth one and the final one this one looks perfect beautifully golden brown smooth evenly textured all over and really really really crispy looking once these cool let's go ahead and uh give these a crack open these are our Mac and ramen Croquettes just by repurposing what we already had and adding some potatoes and cheese M that's a good cheese pull yeah this one has a really good flavor Tony especially like this one even with some sriracha sauce which would taste really really good cuz it with cheese starch noodles ramen MSG pepper sauce yeah that sounds good okay next up another David Chang inspired recipe in another mind of Chef episode from many years ago he made ramen Yoki and that episode is stuck in my head ever since and this would be the perfect opportunity to try it out kind of doing this based off of memory I think he cooks half a pack of the Raman and milk takes it out when it's half cooked so not all the starch is gelatinized and then he actually throws it into a blender with some of the milk that he cooked it in so starchy milk blended with half cooked Ramen and then he adds a seasoning puts this into a bag and just like normal Andi you kind of pipe it out over boiling water and use a knife or something to cut little I guess pillows into the water once those are boiled I'm going to take these out and P fry these in a little bit of butter um I realized now in hindsight that I definitely should have rewatched what he did because I forgot to add egg yolks which definitely would have helped bind these together because these are kind of squishing and falling apart so I missed a very crucial step in making these but even though we pan fried these we can still dust them with a little bit of ramen seasoning and call these more of like a just a crispy Ramen snack for the kids not really a Ramen Yoki of anything just uh you know still good eat on the side but there's one day you should definitely go back and revisit this when we have more uh more egg yolks I think we're pretty much out of eggs uh-oh speaking of being almost out of everything we are now at the end of our Raman party Journey but the thing is just got a lot of stuff left over from all these recipes and now in the spirit of just having fun and also cooking just you know all of our leftovers and making something delicious out of it let's go ahead and try to make this work so we got our scallion oil Ramen sauce from earlier that's super strong I'm going to take all of our leftover seasoning which includes the ramen seasoning the rice cake seasoning which is like a spicy pepper sauce and some other things they had in that bag just kind of throw it all together add a little splash of soy sauce sauce just in case we need a little bit more sodium and then we also have some chicken skins that we found in a plastic bag so I'm just going to cut them up and make sure that we can use it and then we're going to chop up some garlic we had a leftover bulb that was like half missing want to chop up our cocktail sausages into small chunks going to slice up that half of an onion cut up some carrots cut up that bell pepper cut up this whole bunch of cabbage and our Bunches of scallion making sure to keep the whites and the green separate once again all right let's just go and make a giant stir fry Ramen dish in this walk instead of using oil I'm going to take all those chicken skins and cook them on a low heat until all the fat has rendered out and the chicken Skins are fully crisped through and we have a good amount of fat to start stir frying then I'm going to throw in our chopped up cocktail sausages again just to make sure that we can get that nice and crispy and for that to release its fat and Juice as well now I'm going to throw in our cabbage and making sure that all this fat and juices are coating the cabbage and kind of stir frying this until the cabbage is getting a nice Char and has been wilted down I think cabbage is one of those things that is really underrated but with the right Heat and the right amount of fats and Seasonings and technique it can really transform into something quite delicious now while the cabbage is being cooked I'm going to cook the leftover two packs of ramen that we have left over as well as the rice cakes in the same pot until those are ready to go then I'm going to add the onions and the bell peppers stirfry that around a bit and then add in our drained noodles and rice cakes and then throw in the scallion whites on top of that now I'm going to put in that really potent stir fry sauce that we made from all those packets and sauces from earlier once we stir fry that up I'm going to add in our scalling in Greens toss it just a little bit to break the rawness and serve this up now this took some while because we had to cook this in layers but this looks and tastes just like an upgraded version of those Chinese stir fry noodles you might get at the food court at the mall though this is definitely a little bit more flavorful it's a really fun way to just use up all the things you kind of have in the fridge left over cuz they all kind of work together if you cook it correctly even though there's things like cocktail sausages I love the fact that the rice cake texture kind of breaks up the noodles it's kind of like a fun little Jewel I kept reaching for no matter what and it tasted really good cuz it also absorbed up a lot of the sauce and this dish is a culmination of pretty much almost half of our dishes that we made today so there's no Sur surprised that it tastes really really really good almost like an Avengers of the leftovers and yeah I ate a lot of this one and not only did we pack up this dish but we packed up every single thing that we had to make sure that none of the ramen today we made went to waste Tony was a champ and really took home a lot of it he texted me later saying he felt like Scrooge McDuck just eating his way through all the different kinds of ramen dishes and I'm glad that we were able to do this because it was a fun time I learned a a lot about Raman I got to know it very well after having used over 20 packs of it I got to also try out new recipes I never made before I got to try out techniques that we just came up with on the Fly got to try out recipes from other countries that w't Viral or were just part of their culture and definitely learned a lot and we'll be taking a lot of these techniques to heart thank you for joining our ramen party until next time [Music] C down [Music],my favorite eggs benedict the eggs are cooked to a medium poach and that's how I like them now normally Canadian bacon is the preferred protein for eggs Benedicts but I like something crispy and funky so I'm frying up Panetta or Speck so to make the Holliday we're separating four eggs and placing their yolks in the jar of a blender along with a solid teaspoon of Dijon mustard add anywhere between a/4 to a/ teaspoon of cayenne pepper and a couple dashes of mild hot sauce bring half a stick or 60 G of unsalted butter to a boil pouring the butter into the blender's feed hole as you can see I'm cracking the egg into a fine mesh C where I'm swirling it around to get rid of excess white so when I drop it into the 190° F water that's poaching temp it won't produce as many spooky ghostly egg white specters for runny Poached Eggs we want these to go for about 4 to 5 minutes toast your English muffins arrange on a plate with Crispy banetta gently Shuffle an egg onto the mey nest and smother in creamy holidays and there you have

ONL9PEbD-e4,hello there welcome back to an episode of anything with Alvin now I don't know about you guys but I love things when they go on sale which means I love things like buying in bulk and going to Costco so and I saw that Shin ramun one of my favorite instant ramun was uh 50% off at Hmart uh definitely decided to go a little bit overboard and get the family pack and because it was 50% off that means I had to get two because I thought it would be a lot of fun to just play around with upgrading and making instant Raman better and just essentially have a Ramen party and just just try out some cool techniques show you what I personally like to do to Jazz up a pack of instant noodles and hopefully learn something along the way so today we are going to go through 20 ways to enjoy Shin Raman which is different than Japanese instant Ramen this is a Korean version but I'm sure a lot of these methods will apply to pretty much any instant Ramen pack and I'm sure you can have a lot of fun with that too first up a somewhat of a noodle inspired one we're going to start by slicing a couple of scallion and then slicing a few cloves of garlic now I'm going to be completely honest I don't have exact recipes for any of these these are just by feeling and by experience and you know you can always make adjustments along the way and that's the fun of cooking you don't really always have to be super exact all the time CU you can always taste and make things how you like it once the scallions are sliced and the garlic is roughly chopped doesn't have to be too fine I'm going to make a sauce in a bowl I'm combining some sugar soy sauce some Chinese black vinegar I'm sure you could probably use rice vinegar or any sort of acid the pack of Raman seasoning a little bit more sugar cuz honestly I like a lot of sugar and Savory Foods and then I'm going to toss in the scallions and the garlic then I'm going to take a cucumber because I personally love cucumbers as they add a nice little refreshing component to whatever you're eating and then I'm going to cut them into these little shreds I've always taught the Chinese way was to not necessarily cut them vertically but if you do it at more of an angle you get a lot more fun textures along the way and it's a little bit more easy and forgiving once the cucumber is all cut up into nice thin shads the thinner the better then I'm going to take some toasted cesame oil and then put them into a very large spoon and go over to the stove and very carefully Heat this over a direct flame until the oil has started to smoke essentially I'm just turning into this really hot oil now a lot of people have a misconception that you can't really take toasted sesame oil to a super high heat that's really not correct in my opinion because all you're doing is just losing a little bit of that toasty flavor I'm going to to show you how so once you heat that up until it's nice and Smokey I'm going to pour that directly on top of the sauce I just made trying to hit as much of that raw garlic and scalling as possible basically just frying them really quickly to get rid of that rawness once the oil has been nice and incorporated then I'm going to mix them with the same hot spoon to kind of add a little B bit more Sizzle to the sauce and now our sauce is ready give that a nice smell smells very very very good I'm going to take some ramen noodles that I have basically just cooked cooked off to the side according to package instructions but I like them a little bit on the chewier side these don't have the seasoning cuz the seasoning went into the sauce but the vegetables that came with it do go in there I'm going to drain the water out and rinse this with a little bit of cold water cuz I want to make a chewy cold noodle in this situation I'm going to toss the noodles into the bowl and just mix that with the cucumbers and the sauce till everybody is nice and happy now as the Cucumbers sit in this salty sauce a little bit more water is going to get drawn out so I like to kind of let it sit for at least 5 minutes then give it a one more time once this is done just it's ready to eat I'm going to put this on a plate just because I had my morning coffee Tony's actually going to be the first one to dive in here Tony will taste test first he says it's very flavorful I did give it a taste afterwards and it was a little salty but that's okay you can just use that sauce for something else or just scale back on the soy sauce a little bit now he's is going to snack on this and take this aside next we're going to make a version of Roki which is essentially Ramen and toi combined together which a lot of fun stuff that you can kind of throw in however you like it another Korean fun Comfort dish everyone has their own version of making it the way I want to do today I'm going to take some cabbage cut those into pretty large chunks cut some scallions and once the vegetables are cut I'm going to take our cabbage and put them in a good amount of water with our rice cakes which have been just slightly rinsed and dump in some Ramen seasoning to the water the toi pack also came with extra sauce and seasoning so I'm just going to throw that in there as well cuz hey why not and once that's ready to go I'm going to boil that for about 2 minutes and I'm going to put the araman noodles in there cook them until they are ready to go too and just for fun we have a couple of just between soft and hardboiled eggs going to cut those up throw those on top with along with the rest of our scallions as well as some frozen dumplings that we just quickly boiled and threw it in I think this is one of those dishes where you kind of just throw in anything and because it's fun and you probably would making this because you had left of a rice cakes you can kind of just put whatever you want I really like this because it's just a fun mix of everything that just tastes good let's have Rachel try this one yeah I think Rachel expressed how she really liked this one there's a lot of fun stuff in there and there's so many different textures to where uh yeah this is a really fun dish to make okay next up this one might look familiar to some people that have watched parasite ramdon is a version of a dish called chapati which is chapagetti and neoti but instead of neogi which is a spicy Seafood type of instant Raman I'm going to use syaman instead first things first I'm going to cut up our beef into little chunks you can pretty much use any beef you want if you want to go bougie I'm sure you can then I'm going to cut up some onions and also going to save some of these beef fat trimmings from the meat just to use as the fat to fry the onions instead so I'm going to render that down Fry the onions and just because I think this needs a little bit more add a little bit more toasted sesame oil then I'm going to move the onions to one side and throw in the steak and give them a nice sear I don't want to overcook these because we're going to mix them with some hot noodles later once those are good I'm going to cook the noodles I'm cooking the chapagetti and the shinran in a pot with their instant dried veggies but no seasoning once the noodles are cooked I'm going to take out approximately 3/4 of the water that they currently have making sure there's just a little bit there so once we add our seasonings from both of the ramun packets they have a nice little sauce I'm also going to add a little bit of sugar because I think it tastes good and an onion steak kind of heavy black bean flavor sauce and when you mix it all together with the steak and the onions this looks really really really delicious already I'm already getting really excited because I've actually never had this before I'm going to Plate this up with some scallions on top and yeah this is this is really good I think this you could probably even season the beef if you wanted to I kind of held back because I thought it would be too salty but you can definitely salt your steak before you cook it and this is this is this is super good we had some extra Ramen seasoning from one of the bags so I decided to put that dust on top and yeah this one's definitely a keeper I can see I can see why they wanted to make this in the movie Next up we're going to be making a version of Korean army stew or pig have some kimchi some spans American cheese some tofu aramun and scallion again there's a lot of ways to make this you can throw in pretty much anything you want but this one is going to be a little bit more on the simpler side slice up our tofu into just nice large squares then I'm going to slice up our spam again into pretty large sizable chunks because these will be in the stew for a while keeping them in their original sliced form to Fan them out later then I'm going to cut up our scallions now in a pan or a large pot I'm going to add some kuch Chang with water some sugar our ramen dry vegetables but I'm not going to bring this to a boil yet then I'm going to add some kimchi we had lying around and then I'm going to Fan the tofu in one side of the pan and fan out the spam in the other and then the middle a nice little circle of Raman noodles I'm going to put two slices of American cheese kind of wor the tofu and the spam meat and put a good handful of our scallions in the back then I'm going to turn the heat on and bring this into a boil for about 5 or 6 minutes until the ramen is cooked I'm sure you could go a little bit longer to make sure the rest of the stew has nice and Infused flavors because the goal here I don't really think is to make sure you have the most chewy ramen noodles possible every time I was served this in a restaurant they kind of just brought the whole entire thing assembled in the pan and then turned on the heat when they just made it boil so this is the kind of thing that can also boil as you eat it so as you eat it it kind of reduces and gets more intense and delicious in flavor right and Tony definitely really enjoyed this one commenting on how the American cheese just add this nice element of creaminess and saltiness to the kimchi and kochu Jang flavored stew so I would say there's a reason why this dish is so popular both in the states internationally and in Korea okay on to a next one so we have Ramen eggs and peanut butter sriracha and lime kind of going for something that has a little bit of Thai inspired flavor so I'm going to cook our Raman noodles with the vegetables off the side and then I'm going to fry two eggs in a pan just kind of scramble them up in a bit then I'm going to drain the noodles and throw them in the pan with the egg off heat while I go make the sauce I'm going to mix some Sriracha with peanut butter our ramen seasoning and lime juice and kind of toss that together until we have a bit of a sauce and then we're going to pour this all over our noodles and mix that together on one side cuz I kind of want the sauce to coat the noodles first and then mix that with the egg so they can have distinct flavors to be honest this has a a little bit of a pad tie looking kind of visual going on although I'm sure it's far away from the original thing and once we're done just mixing this together cuz the noodles and the eggs are already cooked I'm just going to put some crushed peanuts on top as well as some scallions that are sliced and a little bit more lime juice and tasting this well uh yeah this pad thae style Ramen is shockingly close to many other pad TI I've had in my life even though it's not the real thing it is very very delicious and kind of makes you feel like you're not eating Raman okay next one is the mac and ramen this uses a box of craft mac and cheese as well as uh your Ramen I thought this would be kind of fun to see if we can make this work together so first I'm going to cook the craft Mac in the pot according the package instructions but halfway through I'm going to add in our Raman noodles and I'm going to add in the vegetables in there and once these are all ready to go and nice and out Dente we're going to drain the water out and then instead of water we're going to put in about a/4 cup of milk so that we can have have something to absorb the mac and cheese seasoning a pad of butter as well as the ramian seasoning and I thought this could probably be a little bit more cheesy and based on how well American cheese seems to go well with Shin Raman I'm going to throw in just another slice of American cheese mix it up until it is nice and creamy and cheesy and yeah this is is very quick Mac and ramen if you tap and have both lying around um this one's pretty good I think it really shows how American cheese flavor things go so well with Shin ramun seasoning and super not complicated but the fun textures of both having the noodles as well as the short ones is really really really satisfying reminds me of like Junior High School in a good way okay next we're going to be going on and trying a hack that was pretty popular online making a quote unquote carbonara based on C mayo and egg instead of just using the typical ingredients so first I'm going to take some bacon cut that up and fry it up until it is somewhat crispy I don't like mine too crispy I kind of like it a little bit chewy cuz it makes me think like like I'm eating pork belly too and then once that bacon is drained and cooked I'm going to combine one egg yolk and a good heavy amount of cup Mayo then in the same Bowl I'm adding some freshly grated pecorino cheese that Rachel did healthy crack of black pepper some bacon fat left over and a little bit of the ramen liquid that we made to make a little bit of a thicker sauce that we can now put in the noodles that we cooked off camera once our hot noodles go in that have been drained I'm going to add in a little bit more cheese going to add the remainder of our bacon mix that up and plate it in a nice little Mound this is yeah Carbono Ramen I apologize to the Italians and I guess and Koreans in advance but this tastes very good the CPI does something to enhance the egg yolk and also kind of create a creamy sauce that isn't super creamy but I personally like to add some scallions and some more Ramen seasoning on top at the end I think that kind of balances it out and gives you extra flavors that go well with it and kind of amplif IES but also helps you eat through all the creamy buttery richness of this dish even though there's actually no butter it's all Bacon Fat which is pretty good yeah I like this one a lot okay moving on to the next one we have our Nan we have chicken cheese Kochi Jang and scalling and this one is actually a fun one I've done many many times before so I'm going to take a chicken thigh I guess whatever meat you have lying around you can cut this up in a little cubes then I'm going to grade up a heavy amount of mozzarella cheese honestly any kind of stretchy or py cheese works here mozzarella is typically the most common and also common in Korean cuisine so we're going to use that as well once we have a good enough mountain of this in a pan I'm going to put in some sesame oil and just fry up our chicken thigh until the surface is a little bit Brown I don't want to overcook this and because these are small pieces just going to cook these just for a little bit and then take them out then in the remaining pan juices and oil I'm going to add a good amount of water and cook araman normally but make sure that the water reduces down to the point where it becomes dry at the end then I'm going to add in some GOI Jong and sugar to make sure that it has a little bit of a sauce as well as the ramen seasoning and then I'm going to mix in our chicken once that's all good going to turn off the heat and just like Moses I'm going to spread the Red Sea or the ramen sea and make sure that there's a nice little Alleyway in the middle so that we can put down our entire mozzarella in a mountain pile once this is even I'm going to turn the heat back on to medium cover it with the lid and just wait for the cheese to melt and once we sprinkle some scallions right in the middle this is I guess my take on some cheesy PR Ramen which I think is a version of addition Korea that's a spicy chicken stew that you kind of eat and wrap with cheese and it's very communal and party dish but this one happens to have Braman in it how I like to eat it is that I like to take a little bit of the noodles in the chicken making sure that I have good grip on it and then I like to twist some cheese in the middle around it and then enjoy it all in one giant glorious bite Rachel will be doing the honors here I uh think she likes it this is her favorite so far she has said super super super good and I think the best part about this is that you're eating it out of the pan and it's a fun thing to eat with friends too and I'm sure you could probably use any meat or you might not even need meat to make this work we just haven't had a chicken dye next up Ramen fried rice now this one is exciting never made this but I've seen this in both restaurants as well as the internet and Korea where you can actually use the instant ramen noodles and make them crispy and then fry them in a rice I was super interested so instead of cooking Aram this time in water I'm just going to take the pack and just like we've probably done in high school just Crush that all up and just add our seasonings directly in there and crush it up a little bit more so every noodle is hopefully coated in the seasoning then I'm going to take a large batch of scalling and separate them into whites and greens because for fried rice it's very important to have the whites and greens separate because they have different cooking times then I'm going to take some spam that we have left over and just cut that into tiny little cubes in the large walk I'm going to use the highest heat possible in the stove and heat up a couple tablespoons of toasted sesame oil again I know there's a misconception that you can't really have toasted sesame oil on a high heat but all you're doing is just taking out the aroma you can definitely still use it so that's what I'm going to do I'm going to heat that up until it's smoking crack four eggs and let that sit for a bit before I start to whisk it around because if you whisk it right away there's a higher chance of sticking once the eggs have formed a little bit of a nice shell at the bottom then I'm going to start scrambling them around and pressing them into little bits and crushing them up with the back of the Walk Ladle to kind of get these egg shards it might seem scary there's going to be some but that's kind of the part that gets the egg all nicely charred and brings out the flavor of the egg yolk you start to notice the aroma of the egg yolk come out and be quite fragrant and that's the flavor of fried rice that you get at restaurants the breath of the walk as they say is kind of working its magic at this point to stop the cooking of the eggs that much further we're going to add in our spam that's going to tank a lot of the heat once we get a nice crisp on the edge of those spam and the spam is also started to release both its fat and juices I'm going to throw in our ramen noodle packet that's going to also absorb some of the extra heat and give our noodles a little bit of that extra crispiness then I'm going to add in our scallion whites which need a little bit to cook down and after that's been evaporated a little bit then I'm going to put in a mountain of leftover just rice we had leftover is better you can definitely make it with fresh but leftover for me makes a little bit easier because it dries out the rice and it makes it easier to kind of break up into these small bits the goal of this is to kind of use the back of the W Ladle and toss it around break up any clumps and almost have every single grain of rice separate from the other no sticking and I was taught this by my friend Eric who runs two Taiwanese restaurants in New York and he says by having every grain of rice separate it almost Cooks like a steak and Sears correctly on the outside which is a pretty cool way to think about it once the rice is as separate as much as possible and turn and and frying up and almost dancing again on the edge of the walk it's now time to add the scall and greens turn off the heat and just give the scallion greens just a little bit of a mix in with the hot fried rice just to break the rawness a little B cuz we don't want these to wilt once the fried rice is ready the whole process from start to end definitely took around 20 minutes so the fried rice isn't something you can make in a large quantity really quickly at least the way that I personally like to make it I'm going to serve this on a plate invert it show you guys how it looks and you can see all those little squiggly ramen noodles just in there hanging out and I'm curious to see if this fried rice is going to be extra crispy not just because of the ramen noodle texture but because the noodles absorbed any excess moisture from from the Steam and the moisture of everything else in the rice ooh this is delicious I really like it the crunchiness adds a really nice texture to fried rice I might start making all my fried rice like this as far as seasoning I thought the seasoning packets would be enough but this could use a little bit more MSG I really like this one this is probably one of my favorite ways to just make ramen so far even though it's a little bit more involved but this one is a great recipe and they do serve this dish in restaurant sometimes which does say something okay next up up we have Ramen kacho Pepe again I apologize to the Italians but this one seems fun as well I'm going to take this parmesan and just freshly grate a good amount of it and this one is actually inspired by David Chang he did a video about this a long time ago on mind Dev AA where he show had to make this and I thought it'd be really fun to try so thank you all right in a pan we got one cup of water a pad of butter a little bit of olive oil and then we're going to throw in our cheese once the water has started to heat up a bit essentially making like a Cheesy watery sauce then in goes the dry ramen noodles and we're going to cook this on a medium heat but the whole point of this is to make sure that we're stirring vigorously the whole time making sure that the Raman is not only cooking but also agitating the sauce so that the sauce hopefully doesn't break my guess on why this works is because there's starch coming off from the noodles so as the starch enters the water and with all that agitation and all those nooks and crannies of the ramen it's really helping the cheese sauce emulsify and yeah there is no breaking this is on a pretty high heat I even saw saw some pretty hot boiling bubbles in the corner but the sauce is not broken which is pretty cool I guess it's a cool way to think about how using a product like instant Ramen could really help I guess a sauce that is notoriously hard to make sometimes so once this is all mixed and the ramen have finally cooked through I'm going to add a little bit more cheese just for good measure cuz why not a little bit more pepper and then plate this and then just put the ramen seasoning on the top rather than inside I think in this way you can get a lot more of the contrast between the two tasting on its own it was really good but with the seasoning I think it really takes us to the next level American cheese goes really well with shinr and seasoning but I even think something like parmesan or something milder can really pair well with something that has such a kick yeah this one's my favorite by far flavor-wise technique wise Simplicity wise it might not be easy but it is delicious all right next up we're going to make something that's called Rose Ramen or Rosé Ramen popularized in Korea this is kind of a pink creamy sauce which is a combination of red and white we're going to take a good amount of milk in a pop and just cook our ramen in it but while it's cooking the red comes from a tablespoon of Ki Jang and just to you know amp things up a little bit more to make it feel like we're cooking cooking a couple of cut up onions a Ramen seasoning some cocktail sausages cuz that's just another fun thing that tastes better with this and just cook these until the noodles are pretty much good because the milk is going to be thickened on its own and the starts from the noodles is going to be also thickening the sauce we don't need to drain this at all add a touch of sugar because that always goes good with these kinds of flavor profiles and a little bit of more splash of a milk and just go into a bowl it's super easy the sauce makes itself we're going to add some scallions just at the very end to kind of you know break things up a bit and yeah this is a I guess a easy version of Rose Ramen or Rosé Ramen tastes good the cocktail sausag is just always just something that tastes way better when they're heated in another dish and just a really good easy way to kind of make a creamy Ramen without actually having to use cream okay next up one of my personal favorites Curry Raman so we have Japanese Curry packs that I always usually have in the pantry first I'm going to cut up some leftover carrots and onions just going to sauté them in a little bit of butter add a good amount of water going to throw in our Raman seasoning I'm also going to throw in a curry block from the packet and once that's bubbly and all that Curry block has dissolved and started to thicken I'm going to also cook the Raman itself in the curry and not having to drain it at all and then I'm also going to crack an egg on top so that way get a little bit of a nice surprise I'm going to cover this so that the steam can cook the egg and the noodles evenly and we're going to top this with scallions and eat this straight out of the pot sometimes these vessels are great because not only do you just cook out of it you it serves as your eating vessel as well and it's a single serving well I guess everything is single serving if you're brave enough yeah this is just Cur Cur adaman made with two incredible shelf stable Pantry items from two different cultures and something about the flavor of Japanese Curry combined with bigger more explosive flavors like a Ramen seasoning pack just tastes so so so so good it's like one plus 1 equals star I made this one many many times with many different kinds of flavors but it really is greater than some of its parts even though it may not look as flavorful as it is I love this one all right next one I thought it' be fun to kind of try something based on another video we've done we made a video that was about the Assassin spaghetti after throwing some thinly chopped garlic and sautéing that until Brown in some olive oil I'm going to take the ramion out of its packet and cook the dry noodle straight in the oil try to get as much of a toast on this as possible although it's not really working that well because uh it's not got the best kind of surface area for contact with the pan so we're going to do as much as we can before everything starts to burn and then just going to Ladle in some Jarred tomato sauce on top and just a little bit of water kind of cooking that down and the moment it starts to get sticky and almost starts to burn going to add a little bit more tomato sauce we're going to keep on doing this until the noodles have actually absorbed enough liquid and have cooked through and it's deeply caramelized and on the verge of almost being burned I remember our favorite Parts about the one that we made with actual spaghetti were kind of the crispy bits at the end so I'm not afraid to take this one a little bit further it does help that we do use this in a non-stick pan I think that's kind of the key to making sure that we can control this whole thing yeah this is I guess a assassin ramun or ramun ala assassina it is quite acidic depending on what kind of tomato sauce you use so I think a splash of cream or a little cheese at the end could make this really good and I think the kick from the ramen seasoning makes a tomato sauce tastes a little bit different all right so as you can clearly see we have a lot of scallions because well scallions and ramen are one of the best marriages to ever exist along with uh egg and ramen and American cheese said chin Ramen so what do you do with you have a bunch of scallions you make scallion Ramen so that's exactly what we're going to do first to make a base sauce I'm adding soy sauce some leftover Chinese black vinegar from before good squirt of Honey the ramion seasoning and just the dry vegetables and mixing that together and then we're going to take some scallions chop them into just pretty rough sections they don't have to be small and we're going to actually fry these in a good amount of toasted sesame oil until they have been nice and brown this is on a medium Heat this might take a little bit to make sure that the water content releases before the scallion start to burn but the scallion should look pretty dark and not green At All by the time you're done but this should be very very very fragrant once that's ready we're going to add our sauce directly into the oil cook that around and let it reduce after it gets hit with some heat and then I'm going to add our cooked ramen noodles which have been drained off camera and just toss them in there and plate these up now this might not look like the most craziest delicious ious thing in the world but the aroma and the fragrance from the oil and the scalling just combining with all those delicious things from the sauce and the seasoning just make this one of my favorite ones I guess ever the flavor is just so strong if you're like me and you like that kind of burst just where every single part of your taste buds is just being stimulated you're going to like this one it's just super super super delicious and I really wanted to keep eating it but we were so full and we still had a couple more so I we're going to hold back we did make a good amount of extra sauce though so now we have half of a bowl of just scallion oil sauce that I'm sure we'll find something to do with later we're going to hold on to that so we made a lot of ramen dishes and Tony and rachal lime ate a lot and took home a lot but to be honest we do have some ones we couldn't finish in our leftover so let's have some fun trying to figure out what to do with these leftover completed Ramen dishes have now gone up you know gone cold and congealed and soggy no longer chewy and noodle like this is the Rosé Ramen from earlier this one was just kind of sitting around and as you can see is congealed and cold and in the shape of its container what we're going to do is I'm going to go ahead and take these cocktail sausages cut these up into a little pieces going to fry these until they're nice and toasted and then just dump in the noodles as well and kind of just break them up with a spatula and just kind of try to get a nice amount of heat so that they're getting a little bit of crisp and toast on them they're no longer these ramen noodles at this point I kind of treat this almost just as like rice once this is all kind of toasted toasted through and things are looking a little bit better I'm going to save half of this toasted crisped up Rosé Ramen mixture for later and use half of it in remaining in the pan and then I'm going to add squirt of ketchup and a little bit of soy sauce cuz I'm going for more of like an Omar rice flavor profile here I thought that would go well with the cocktail sausages as well the noodles and then once that's all stir fried I'm going to push this mixture into the corner of the pan and then I'm going to add in four beaten eggs and kind of try to layer them into one solid sheet at the bottom making sure to coat the edges of the noodle mixture in it so that it adheres to it and I'm going to cover it wait for it to cook and then roll this up and essentially kind of make a Ramen version of omu rice or uh omu Raman or ramlet I don't really know which one sounds better but it's essentially a way to kind of treat the noodles as rice after you break them up cook them with flavor profiles common to Omar and just transform that soggy congealed kind of thing into something more appealing and delicious little squirt of ketchup across the top nice little drizzle for presentation purposes and I do agree this is a this is a pretty nice way to Jazz up some leftover Ramen because the egg kind of wraps around the noodles anyways and you're just eating like an egg with some flavorful starch and that could be anything it

zbwERu9UAcE,welcome back to babish boot camp I'm here to answer all of your culinary queries henrique jerau asks how do you keep your knives sharp common misconception is the idea that this is a knife sharpener this is not a knife sharpener this is a honing steel this straightens the edge of the your knife these options sharpen all right so the three most popular ways to sharpen your knives are with a drag sharpener a stone stone a wet stone and an electric sharpen ER so with the drag sharpener it's exactly what it sounds like you're taking the knife starting right at the heel dragging it through next up is the Wet Stone two-stage system you're soaking this guy for 10 minutes you're starting at the heel of the knife and you're dragging it diagonally across so the whole length of the blade makes contact with the stone you're doing that maybe five to 10 times per side then you're flipping it over and doing it again on the finer grit side of the stone my favorite option is the electric sharpen This Is the Gen X option it feels like so freaking easy and it gives you a pretty wicked sharp edge basically there's two sides to each stage pretty loud and annoying to listen to that's going to give you a crazy sharp edge that maybe isn't going to last as long as Wet Stone it's not going to be as sharp as a wet stone but it's still going to be crazy sharp and it's crazy easy oh that's f,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pTt4BjY34gk,bagels and locks you probably can't say the way I'm pooching out my ass right now but it's weird no no I I kind of saw it in your lips [Music] though in my ongoing mission to discredit my abilities publicly on camera I'm going to see if I can make better bagels and locks than you know New York [Music] City now I know what you're think New York City Bagels and lucks well those are

promo code babish to save 20% off your order time to check out the competition first up Russ and Daughters a veritable New York icon in business for more than 100 years Obama's favorite and other facts probably uh one one of the the all-time greats that's still kicking let's see if I can do better job than them apparently they're most famous for their smoked smoked locks so they have a significant advantage over me this is smoked but looking at their bagel I think that I got them licked on the bagel I think I got their Bagel licked let's see what all the fuss is about okay a worthy Contender indeed the locks is delicious really silky and fatty the flavor is fantastic definitely Smoky not overwhelmingly so I mean this is over a 100 Years of knowledge going into the the this little slice I don't know exactly how I'm going to fare against that but I do think that I I might have a better Bagel The Bagel even though it's not like my favorite kind of bagel it's still perfect for a sandwich because it's not too tough and chewy really fantastic and I'm going to finish eating this as soon as the camera St stop rolling cuz I haven't had lunch next up the decidedly newer kit on the Block at only 60 years old shelsky my personal favorite for breakfast sandwiches if I want a breakfast sandwich I'm getting it from shelis so I haven't tried their locks yet let's see what's going on bagel's even more tender than Russ and Daughters which is really good for a sandwich it's not my favorite kind of bagel but I have to admit that it eats better as a sandwich cuz it's tender their locks are much they're not smok smoked so they're much more subtle again nice and fatty and silky but the locks is way more subtle than the ones from Russ and Daughters if Russ and Daughters is the Cadillac this is the Honda Civic it does everything well it's not blowing me away but it's getting me to work every day on time for 20 years typical bagel and locks format bagel cream cheese locks and very often Red Onion cap that's pretty much it you might know what bagels are but what the are locks what I need a key locks are a kind of cured salmon usually very simply cured in a 50/50 mix of salt and sugar so to make locks at home we have to engage in a bit of a tricky practice that is curing and serving raw fish it's going in raw it's coming out Raw it's going in raw the opportunities for bacterial growth for tapeworms for all them kinds of horrible nasties are at an all-time high so you want to make sure you get your fish from a good fish man let's go on a little field trip okay so I'm curing salmon and effectively serving it raw and I don't want you guys to get worms so I'm at one of the best seafood dealers in Brooklyn shipwreck I love uh shipwreck and fish tailes both great places and both you can get it's a shimi grade salmon so your butt won't get worms in it back out into the slop so I want to do this in a very safe way Let's Line this sucker with the Earth killer itself Alvin you can cure an flastic rrap right I can't think of any reason I am not an expert in literally anything and I am not asserting that anything that I'm doing is something you should try at home why would you ever make your own locks it doesn't make sense you can get it at most grocery stores and it's not bad so wait why why are we doing this why are you just to prove that I can do better than Brooklyn so I have a mixture of 75 G each sugar and salt so I want to add some pastrami flavors to my locks uh which means I'm going to add some pami spices to the cure a tablespoon of mustard seed carway seed coriander seed and then this is a departure but I'm going to add some fennel not usually part of the mix actually wait this is giving me a different idea now this is basically an everything bagel seasoning everything bagel locks on salmon flavored Bagels perhap no all right so about a tablespoon of each of those whole spices and now I'm going to add some paprika both for color and flavor this is smoked paprika now I'm doing this because locks is sometimes smoked and when it's smoked it becomes comes a new thing called smoked salmon and what you need for that is a cold smoker even if you have a legit cold smoker and not one that's Jer rigged out of cardboard boxes and tampons it's very dangerous because you're holding the salmon for 18 to 24 hours at like 80° F super dangerous so really don't recommend trying that at home ever but what this is going to do is bring me some of that Smoky flavor without the risk of death and dismemberment and I'm going to add a teaspoon of garlic powder and a teaspoon of onion powder already looking fun wait what this smells insane now how Smoky was that paprika [Music] Brad that sure is just salt and sugar isn't it all right so we have salmon that's what this is I'm going to generously sprinkle it with the Cure in the hopes that uh it will stay disease free salt and sugar do inhibit bacterial growth it's not going to save you it's not going to protect you but it is is a reason why curing is a thing so that uh Sailors I'm I'm high seas could en enjoy corn beef on the road on the road of the ocean am I supposed to add all this seems like a tremendous amount I might go watch the video where I did this Bish sexy question mark oh I did it in plastic wrap isn't that a relief just make sure that everybody's really good and coated I'm going to carefully wrap this guy up try to get all the air out cuz I don't want it to oxidize this same container that I was going to use to house it will become my weight oh no don't want to do that see left an imprint doesn't matter at all because I'm going to be slicing this all right if we're going to leave an imprint let's do it right shall we so now this goes into the fridge for three whole days I'm going to flip it every day try and evenly distribute The Cure and hopefully it won't kill us all only one way to find out does it imprint my face on it damn it so now on to the bagel element a process that coincidentally is also going to take 3 days isn't that fun I'm going to start with a preferment 250 g of flour 1 teaspoon of yeast and 350 G of water I know this isn't a kettle it's not hot see [Music] 350 G of water H What's 350 plus 250 6 600 600 sure we're going to whisk them up until they're mostly smooth and this is just going to sit here and it's going to live up to its name it's going to ferment which is going to give our Bagels better flavor and I think even gluten development if I'm not mistaken you're letting yeast do its job converting sugar into carbon dioxide and other and that creates flavor somehow so this guy now needs to ferment for at least 4 hours up to 24 at room temperature the longer you let it go the more flavor it's going to develop don't let it go any longer than 24 because then the yeast is going to start to die out and you're not going to get the spring that you need in in your in your in your bagel um what's behind your back H behind your back wait why are you holding your arm like that oh I um this is one I made earlier about 6 hours ago and as you can see it's become a bubbling cauldron of yean activity so into the bowl of a stand mixer goes are wonderfully gooey preferment there we go you want to get every last drop because this is the only source of water for the dough this is all of our moisture you're just saying that cuz you heard yourself say that earlier aren't you yeah and now you're going to cut to an instant replay black and white where I'm staring at the computer make sure you get every last glob of it because this is our only source of moisture in the dough okay who's that some [ __ ] some some big stupid man well it's a useful tip that I said years ago 450 G of bread flour 10 G of kosher salt and 25 G of Honey now normally I use non-diastatic barley malt syrup this both lends color and flavor to the dough by doing some bull with proteins or something anything thing I don't know about food is always protein based we're going to mix this until it comes together and then once it forms a Shaggy dough we're letting it knead on medium speed for 10 minutes want profound gluten development because I like a chewy Bagel okay well that took approximately forever though I do not understand why it's a very straightforward dough it's just barely passing the window pane test I'm going to move forward with it because this is getting outrageous we have our bagel dough I'm going to just kind of roll into a ball it is a little dry getting a little nervous 3 days is a long time to wait to find out that you up now we're going to let it prove for about 1 hour I'm going to put it in this here off oven with the lights turned on those lights are going to generate a little bit of heat an hour later hopefully we'll see the dough have poofed up just a little bit not too much we only put a teaspoon worth of yeast in there it's been working all day so we'll see you in an hour let's see what's happening here I don't feel good about this man I don't feel good about these something's wrong something's gone terribly wrong the gluten just is not developed enough like it's just tearing like no problem yeah I don't feel good about these they're not going to beat Brooklyn's Best you're absolutely right about that all right I something up I don't know what here's the good news and the bad news good news is that swap I made earlier still here it is now 7:20 in the p.m. and I think it's a little late in the day to get another batch started however this preferment can now preferment all night we can Let It Go all night which means it's going to develop a lot of flavor it means that the bagels are only going to get 2 Days in the fridge instead of three which a little scary I'm going to wrap this up and hang on to it just in case and then let's take another crack at this first thing in the AM whoa that almost went down upper I like so I'm not going to save that dough we don't need that dough it's bad dough it feels like the steaks just got raised we're not making steaks Brad we're making bagels and [Music] [Applause] locks it's the next morning I went upstairs drank a full bottle of wine cried loudly in the mirror and got 14 hours of sleep I'm ready to try again this preferment has been pre fermenting and as you can see it's super bubbly and frothy and Alive with Wonder and life so now let's push my stand mixer once again to its very limits but maybe not as much this time because I think I under hydrated the dough last night which is why it was so you know dry and so now I'm going to add more water and that will hopefully you know hydrate it more I don't know how science works here we go hopefully 10 minutes last night it went for 20 keep your fingers your toes and your eyes across from me so this has only been going for 10 minutes and already it's off to a way better start this is pretty much good to go it's a little sticky this is stickier than I'm using used to my Bagels being so that's we'll see how that works out okay there we go oh yeah it is a little sticky but look at how nicely it is becoming a ball of dough right now nice smooth TT ball and I'm going to cover it this time with plastic wrap because the moistened towel it dried out pretty significantly and I don't want to repeat that mistake all right that's proving up nicely as you can see it has poofed significantly I think I might have ftic crap I'm going to let them rest for 20 minutes so that they don't tear too much when I shape them into Bagles we'll see you in 20 minutes we'll be right back as you can see these have puffed just a little bit and now it's time to punch a hole I I'm terrible at rolling Bagels so I'm just going to punch a hole in the center give them a little stretchy poo and that's that I tend to rewi the hole on the big day two days from now because it will close up during its time in the fridge a lot of jokes I can hear you want to make Brad but don't do it don't do it this is definitely the not very legit way to do it I I I imagine the bagels that we're getting from these Pro places are going to be rolled not punched and stretched like this but uh that is the realm of my ability so that is the place in which we're going to operate so now I'm going to recover this with the greasy plastic wrap now these guys are headed for a long cold nap in the fridge ideally three days but I'm going to go two because of our foibles yesterday here we go all right Bradley it's the big day and here's our big boys eight Bagels that have been lying in weight in the fridge downstairs cold proofing slowly developing gluten flavor all the good things of the world now they just want me to boil them and bake them I'm going to give them exactly what they want so I'm going to do a couple experiments here I have eight total Bagels I need three so I have a little room for experimentation so I'm going to try a couple one at a time I want to try egg whites that's a popular thing both to improve the crust and to help the toppings at here I'm going with sesame seeds and I want to try using the Innova Precision oven this thing is a steam injected oven kind of like a comi oven at a professional Bakery I'm still going to boil the bagels like you could steam them but the more more traditional method is to boil them it gives them a better crust but to bake them in a steam injected oven could give them better spring could give them better crust serve this in about 3 hours and 20 minutes so I think plenty of time unlike all the other challenges we've done up to this point I'm I'm spoiled for time so I'm going to make these Bagels give them plenty of time to cool and then all I have to do is slice the salmon that's it crack open a a brick of Philadelphia I'm not making cream cheese who do you think I am oh I need onions all right so this is for boiling the bagels and you might be saying to yourself babish that's not much water I know the bagels float okay they don't they don't S at the bottom so it doesn't really matter if you have you know you don't need like a huge cauldron now we need to make this water a base so we have basing soda this is base right like as an an opposite of an acid I'm going to do about half teaspoon worth roughly and again just like in the Bagels normally I would put some barley maltt syrup in this water has less of an effect in the water than it does in the dough in the dough it's doing all them kinds of crazy to the flavor and to the texture of the of the bagel in the water it's pretty much just adding color so molasses is going to stand in just fine now this is black strap molasses so it's very potent and I want the water to kind of look like tea I don't want it to to be too dark let's see what we got here okay yep okay water's boiling let's do a tester I'm going to stretch the hole just a little bit just to remind it that it's a bagel into the water it goes and it's going to go for 20 seconds now it's going to look really like and deflated when I flip it when I take it out of here but this is just this is the first stage of this Pokemon what is this bagel's Pokémon names oh [ __ ] I've went way too long stop talking to me about Pokemon for two seconds Brad there we go off it goes remember I said it's going to look crappy but it's going to Spring in the oven all this moisture all this heat all this moisture okay and I'm going to press it firmly into sesame seeds I want lots and lots of sesame seeds good coverage test number one is oven bound let's go what's test number two going to boot E B I just put one of the bagels into the steam oven hopefully that's going to help with the oven spring maybe give it a better crust I have no idea that's why I'm trying it I have one more test to do before I start fine-tuning which is trying an egg white wash I think it's going to go in the Inova because this is a steam oven which is going to give it a better environment to keep growing and not uh be stimmed by drying out now I'm going to let them cool for just a moment so I can brush on the egg white let's check on our Bagels back here oh this guy's done out of the Inova what looks to be a better iteration of a bagel and out of the oven we've experienced a lot less spring this is cooled off now enough now where I can brush it so I'm going to do that quick this hopefully is going to give it an even better crust and help this sesame seeds to stick okay there we go there's our egg white Bagel I'm going to throw him or her into the Anova hopefully we'll get a cool result let's find out so learn some things here I definitely overboiled this bagle you can see look how short it turned out o it's a little pale on the bottom all right so these guys need to be flipped and finished on the bottom the air is not getting around there the way that I would like it to clearly the heat did not get to the bottom let's see what happened with this guy same deal oh oh he's stuck oh boy all right see we're learning we're learning learning things oh yeah okay let's uh finish him off I'll do it in here just cuz the Inova is now preoccupied all right so I'm going to see how that guy works I'm going to finish these guys off then I'm going to cut these open make sure that they have a decent crumb before I even continue with this competition okay let's seeoo yeah buddy one thing is becoming abundantly clear to me I need to oil up my rack what because these guys are sticking to it that's pretty awesome these sesame seeds are married to this Bagel however it's paler than its counterparts you can see that it's brown all the way underneath the sesame seeds sesame seeds are coming off way more easily but this inhibited Browning what does a guy do you can see these guys have an incredible crust and a great crumb they're looking great on the [Applause] inside perfect perfectly just chewy good and crisp on the outside perfect this guy I don't know what to do with this guy also this is something I'm really proud of look at those bubbles this is like a leopard print of blisters on this bread that's from the cold fermentation if we just made the dough threw them in the water baked them that still be decent but they're going to have a flat shiny surface these cold fermented ones that just translates to extra crisp all right so now I'm out of time unbelievably even though I had all the time in the world somehow I'm still up against the clock so I need to make the final decision now okay yeah I'm skipping the egg wash all right my four besties be brave be brave here we go ow as well just sprinkle them on top for God s here they go God even after oiling up my rack I'm having trouble getting off what oh I lost some oh boy yeah oil up my rack but I can't get these guys off please don't tear please don't tear you're tearing aren't you I can feel it the good news is that I only planned on serving on the top halves of these Bagels damn it what is happening I the other ones didn't stick this much oh God damn it why [ __ ] I hope it doesn't ruin the texture of them too because now the insides are going to release all their steam they were perfect why I used a non-stick Rag and I oiled it why did they stick so much the other ones didn't stick that much why what happened why does anything happen who are we what's the point of life where's the toaster thank you they look fantastic apart from the fact that they are ripped open on the bottom what do you want me to say Brad what are you looking for what you want I'm just a joural true I can't blame you This Is War you're just doing your job all right salmon time I got to rinse these suckers off for two reasons first off I don't want the spices to differentiate me from the comp comptition it's not every day that you see spices like this on locks so I don't want to have any giveaways also lots and lots of salt on here and the general school of thought is that you should rinse them off Pat them dry and they'll be nice and salty but not too salty mustn't have wet locks I still got a couple little errant spices on there but I don't think it's going to be too much of a giveaway and what I need to do is basically slice it right off the skin leaving the skin on and I'm just sort of slicing across the meat and trying to slice it right off the skin the th thinner and longer you get this the more tender it is let's give this a taste let's see what's going on was delicious barely salty so that's fine actually cuz I I don't want it to be too too salty so now I just need to slice it real freaking thin without mangling it like I'm doing right there there we go there we go there we go there we go that's a good one these are all still usable too like you know once it's stacked on there you're not going to be able to tell I don't have the smoke flavor that those big boys have but it does taste unique it tastes of pastrami spices I put on there primarily caraway seed which is cool like that's that's a that's a you know that's a prevalent uh everything bagel spice I have enough I think I have enough the the the flavor definitely permeated a little bit but I wish that I had left those spices on and salt honestly what's wrong with me today everything everything's just going slightly wrong I'm going to have I'm going to have finished product here but not the not on my terms time to assemble my bagel got some whipped cream cheese please just taste perfect after all this Tomy please just taste Perfect all right I'll try to use my scrappiest Scrappy scraps save the big beautiful slabs for the real deal and on top go some thinly sliced red onions and of course some Capers I don't know why they do it this way I mean it looks a lot better but all this rolls off there you have it there's my bagel it is way too thin uh they not only didn't rise enough but also they got torn in half and I think deflated a lot while they were cooling because uh all their moisture just pissed out of them all right let's see what the final result is [Music] okay I mean it tastes great tastes great The Bagel could be my undo undoing so many ways but one of them is The Chew I had to really fight to get through that the other guys um shelis in particular you just bite it like you do a normal sandwich this one you kind of got to fight it a little bit you got to tug at it caraway seed is what comes through the most prevalently so it's got a really nice unique flavor to it so hopefully that'll be my Saving Grace but like God damn dude there's hardly any bagel there it's like oh boy I'm I'm going to slice them normal I'm going to slice mine as best I can and we'll take it from there so the next thing to do now is build three of these cut them in half and await God's judgment God in this case being my employees of my [Music] staff look what we got here one of Prem is that Andy did one Andy did one okay yeah I'm shocked they all look the same this one has poppy seeds Okay and then these two are Sesame different Sesame is King I mean it is so this one is like to me already at a disadvantage have you guys had bagels and locks before um I have I think I might have a fear of it but we're going to go for it I mean just like it's like a texture thing I think it's just a little did one place just not have Sesame left or is this an Andrew choice I guess we don't know some people don't want drugs in their system those make you test positive for drugs you know that PO SE can make you test positive for something what is it drugs you know which one yeah I don't blind blind you want to say first you say which one you think middle middle yes 100% all right facts facts you knew it already or I know it every time it's like deep inside you see this DIY yeah it's like realer you know don't put this on Andy's a b no no it's fine filing he's the David bla of food I mean we he's going to blow our mind o this is I look disgusting when I also talk about that's really good chewy like you know when your teeth scrape against each other wait what locks is really good yeah changing your mind at all maybe a little bit I love this locks this locks is delicious you know what I'm just now realizing locks is is the Pudo of the sea same texture and it comes kind of in like the same thinness slice slic especially this one this one looks thinner yeah than the other ones like these have a shine to them pedestrian it's on its way but it's not it's not doing you know I'll eat anything yeah I mean of course I'll eat any crap yeah no the locks the locks are really good the bagel's a little bit tough yeah I I really like it I do like the I do like how this bread looks though I say that like it does look very nice but it does it is a little crunchy there at the end um that does make it a little hard captain and crunch your mouth but really good good first one absolutely I love locks and this has it but I love it it's a 10 but who am I going to give an 11 to H you know I think you need to recalibrate your ratings right this one's an a who's going to get an A+ number two I like how oh you hear that good that's nice you can see I like like look at that it's Airy fluffy it tells a story it's going to be spongy it's going it do a lot better for me let's try I look terrible when I eat I mean they it's only a second they just clip so this one has a lot of sesame seeds kind of a Browner not Browner but almost looks like flaky on the sides yeah nice bubbles too mhm the bagel's better bagel's better locks might be worse it's better than that crap that dense crap oh this is like a cloud the locks are really good too you know what I heard La is getting into Bagels shut up it took you long enough shut up it took you long enough yeah yeah some of the best bagels are in La shut up right good for you get your your own thing yeah get one thing just be a [ __ ] model DJ Bagels alone do farar Jewish food that should be your thing sorry you know what I was saying the other day what when American this is not making the episode we'll see when America finally decides to take white away from us in case it makes the episode the episode okay this is a I think it's a valid theory that Adam espouses person potentially Sor and I will have to lose white in our 40s and to further explain Jews are for lack of a better word white in America we decided the I'd argue we're we're already Fringe we've always been Fringe white if we're always poser white if anything but America decided to give it to in the same way that Cubans have been allowed to but Mexican people haven't right it's very arbitrary sorry for the race sign but when they take it away from us Cubans are white is what America lets Cubans be white but that's fun okay but what I will say is that once that happens we're going to have to make a a they KN like us about spartic people The Bagel is much better airier it just bites better less there's no toughness it tastes fishier like if I was camping and I caught a salmon and I skinned it and then we all ate it I like I do like the bagel better the locks not as much for some reason like I should like it more than I like it I feel like it like the things are probably better like technically speaking but that tasted better to me like all around I want more that's very good the crust on it is very um and there's like a not sourdough but like some sort of extra flavor no this by far is that yeah that thing is aing hockey puck where do you usually get bagels shelis oh nice is that close to you yeah well like do no sh oh well they have multiple locations jokes you think you'd recognize it if it was one of these three yeah o okay now doing it yes three turn are you going to tell us if you recognize this as Shel skis it looks like shelis all right number three l so good mhm got that smokiness M hold the phone that's that's the one that's it that's so good that's it this from the store that's from Andy mhm yeah it's just so much chewier and denser I think the texture still doesn't hold up to the second one I feel like that one has the best texture cuz this one it it gets like not quite Thomas's Bagel you know what I mean where it's like you kind of have to like really bite down to to get it and like kind of wiggle it that is eerily similar to what I was thinking the same thing this is I want to keep eating it again yeah this one I want more of wow wow I don't even know what how to describe how it's better the bagel is fluffier the locks the locks tastes better better the smokiness and like the the salty and the cess is is a lot stronger in this one I'd say it almost overpowers a little bit I can see that man I like pieces of each one of them I know I want to eat these back to bag oh H it's completely different than what I totally different totally different than the first bite what happened really wild because that's delicious it's so good I like the like I can taste the bagel flavor M you know the the the it's like you know when you have like whatever fishy that bagel's so good though mhm this is constructed better the bagel is like I think if you gave these two be Bagels to someone and was like tell me which one's better they'll say this one but like you said you can really taste the bagel on this one yeah this one's more bre sesame seeds yes I'm going to try this one again yep same Bagel is by far the best yeah like that one but then the fish comes in and punches me in the tongue there's some like unique herbs went into carrying this yeah almost like like cardamom or like oregano uh less traditional but these are much more like CL classic Smoky and sweet just kind of like very simple and strong um but the bagel is so good in this one this is hard because if I was ranking just the bagel like if I have to rank the whole experience I think it's different than if it was just the bagel mhm because I like this Bagel a whole lot it's the best but like as an overall experience I have you tried the locks by itself no I haven't give it a shot it's interesting it's revealing I'm not sure that I wanted that like very fishy it's all good though they're not all good this is the crust and the and the fluff yeah he learned this he did learn this yeah where did he learn it in Basics with babish eventually yeah but no he went away where to a cottage in Vermont yeah just to learn Bagels like a Mr Miyagi of Judy yeah yeah maybe you're not ready for bagel all right so starting with third place 3 2 1 that one boom yeah third place it was good at the beginning and then just slowly faded into the background for me the B The Bagel lost it for it all right number two three two one boom yeah such a good bagel which is a shame cuz the bagel's so good I know yeah this one like if it was just the bagel and cream cheese I feel like it would have like if it was just bagels and cream cheese this one probably would have won easy winner all right first place this one yeah it's a little tougher for me like like as far as the actual texture goes of the bagel so I don't like that as much but then the overall experience like the taste it just it just kind of works better for me the combo yeah yeah like has no like weaknesses 3 2 1 third place trying to get a face from Brad you won't give us anything second place 3 2 1 second place yep and then this is first I'm scared this is Andrew because of how good the bagels made there's like an extra flavor this one is just but it packs such a punch M it's not cravable for some reason like this I would eat a whole bagel this I'm like I'm fine not eating the rest of it it's it's a rich sandwich yeah it's maybe it is just too much going on it's too challenging for something you ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
d I would eat more of it if I were hungry and if I had some soy sauce and if I if I had nothing else uh so I'm I'm I'm going to give this a six I think that's what this guy gets this this sleeve of of vegetable Oreos I'm not going to look so because I I I heard some big reaction is from Steve and I want to I me you're disappointed yeah it's very thank you Nico no thank you Steve oh  oh my God it's beef and broccoli okay beef and broccoli let's see if it lives up to the the the Eye of Steve's mind beef and broccoli oh that was crispy was that a one-off how is this crispy how is that crispy and delicious steeve your instincts are impeccable we should have you instead of operating a camera guessing whether or not food's going to taste good the show within the show I mean it was fried but still that's incredible that this is crispy it tastes almost freshly made like the broccoli if anything is what gives it away is Frozen Frozen it's pretty mushy and it's surrendered its flavor entirely to the sauce and the sauce tastes good Blown Away Blown Away nine all right next up we have the chicken schwarma Bowl basmati rice Sharma schwarma seasoned chicken meat red bell pepper spinach pickle red onion and creamy garlic sauce this sounds like the stuff that gives me a really bad tummy ache from the cart on the side of the street smells pretty good oh that's quite good that really tastes like the stuff from the schwarma truck not as good but it's going to give me a tummy ache either way it's going to it's going to hurt me but it hurts so good so how can I complain the white even the white sauce is there that's the one thing that's very different the white sauce is like pure garlic from the schwarm truck this stuff it's just there it's showing up but you'd never know it it's a little what do kids say now non plused what's that mean what does that mean the kids say that kids say non plus right I think that's adult say adult that's a big that's a big word that's two small words hey kids do you say non plus I could haveing sworn it was like that they were calling like being all agitated like plused and I'm like I'm non plused about this well don't I feel like a fool well long story short I'm a little non- blessed about this it's not bad but there's nothing crazy or amazing about it I'm I'll give it a I'll give it a seven I like it all right next up we have mandarin orange chicken uh this seems to be very different from the previous orange chicken entron bowl just picking up the pieces they look bigger they definitely have a different breading and they feel crispy presumably because they were heated in the oven you can heat it in the microwave but it does recommend oven H okay well there you have it folks I'm I'm very curious to see we don't still have the box for that do we this is very clearly a different product uh it tastes different it behaves different and it's genuinely crispy the sauce is genuinely like flavorful orange chicken sauce there's a solid amount of chicken inside the breading it's not all breading but it's better than some takeout Saed and deep fried temper style chicken that I've had and I would mistake it for takeout I would have assumed that this was from a you know just local Chinese restaurant I want to give it a 10 but I'm not going to because it's still not like objectively a perfect food God damn is it good I'm going to give it a nine we got honey walnut shrimp Corb me if I'm wrong but this would be Bang Bang Shrimp right honey walnut that's bang bang bang bang just straight up honey walnut shrimp crispy battered shrimp with candied walnuts no stories no no no Rhymes let's see what happens when I put it in my mouth chew and swallow it all right still impressively crispy but not as crispy as the chicken and the shrimp has that really bouncy frozen shrimp texture probably can't be avoided um the flavor is really great it tastes it's like honey walnut shrimp yeah the shrimp texture is not awesome and The Temper batter is not as crispy as it turned out with the um mandarin orange chicken so I'm going to knock this down to a seven it is a little bit doughy that being said it's still quite good definitely better than I would have imagined you could make it all right next up we have vegetable Biryani with a garlic naan which looks to be positively strewn with cantro so I'm going to try to eat around that no you know I'm just going to eat it see what happens yep that's lantro that's good otherwise the texture's good garlic flavor is good uh now let's try this biryani Biryani is normally an extraordinarily flavorful dish needs more salt uh it's very very very lightly spicy it's Laden with different kinds of vegetables and it def definitely has a a wide variety of spices in it because it tastes that big full beryani flavor um the chicken look are these look at these things what are these things what are they seasoned Basmati rif with vegetable dumplings you could have fooled me now that I had one on its own I'm very glad that they're vegetable dumpling if that was chicken that'd be upsetting it's good but nothing to write home home about I'm going to give the garlic naan a six cuz it is an upgrade on the other na the briyani I'm going to give it another seven because it needs something salt particular it needs it and doesn't have it you could fix that you shouldn't have to that's why you sh at Trader Jo that should just be the slogan just that just Trader Joe's you shouldn't have to shouldn't have to what don't worry about it yeah it's I'm going to give it seven Chan Masala a chickpea Curry looks pretty legit got some nice fat floating on top that's what you want to see let's just try chickpea see what kind of we're dealing with here that's quite good the chickpeas are more toothsome than they would be if you just got them got them out of a can they have a great texture to them they're not mushy at all they don't taste like they've been hyper you know canned and processed and the sauce super flavorful nice and fatty if you if I ordered Indian takeout and you brought me a a thing of this I'd be like there's the Indian takeout I ordered thank goodness so that I mean that that's really imp I'm going to give it a nine another nine next up a good oldfashioned chicken dick Masala uh we already tried the well it was vegan tikka masala before right and that was pretty awful and the the sauce looked markedly different the vegan tikka masala sauce was it was darker and it was less red it didn't look like tikka masala this looks more like tikka masala there's less fat floating on the top nice big generous chunks of chicken a tiny bit dry but maybe the best chicken texture so far today like it's a little dry but it's a big old piece of white meat chicken and it's not that dry it's not stringy it's not tough It's just chicken and the sauce tastes like a normal tikka masala sauce why's my hand wet why don't you tell me my hand was glistening not even that's going to look bad people are going to be like why is his hand wet this is objectively solid if I got it from an Indian restaurant I would be disappointed cuz it is slightly dry but that's the only issue with it I didn't try the rice let me try the rice even though it's all pretty much the same no it's not that's different than the the the rice that came with the I have a feeling that these are being made you know by entirely different people authentic Indian recipe means that they imported this from India so it's no wonder that it tastes better and that the rice is solid great for Frozen wouldn't wouldn't pass for restaurant so I'm going to give it a seven that I think that that's fair we have carne assada burritos grilled Angus beef with onions roasted pablano chilies and cilantro God they love their cilantro and they love showing they love boasting about it they're very boastful with the cilantro we get it and we'll be back in 7 to 10 minutes when that stops being the temperature of the surface of the Sun let's see what we got oh my oh my oh my I'm stunned that they didn't put any rice in this burrito you can make a burrito without rice sure but it's a cheap easy filler you double the size of this damn thing probably have the meat I just saved Trader Joe's $2 million wow it's so hot it's incredible that being said I have a job to do oh boy didn't see that look at that there's a crack that has formed right down the middle just like in Pacific Rim this is a there's a breach who really good flavor really like must be the pablanos like I love roasted pablanos i i i and there's this very familiar flavor I don't know what it is I had it somewhere like in a really good tamale or something my youth but damn that's good I mean flavor-wise the the the burrito itself as you can see huge SOG issue on the bottom it is falling apart this one's not falling apart though this side's doing fine so presumably if you just flip it in time so the moisture doesn't build up you'll be okay beef is tough I will say that the beef is not tender it tastes like it's hot off the grill I swear to God it tastes like it's hot off the grill beef's a little tough tortilla is a little gross but maybe that's user eror and also it's a frozen burrito tortilla is never going to be amazing but I really like that I wish it had cheese and I wish it had literally anything but just beef in it like it's just beef and the beef's a little tough I think that getsy a seven cuz it's quite good but it's got shortcomings I think I'm a seven not not attractiveness why just as a person you and me burrito we're going to make it here's where we separate the Sheep from the Lambs uh because it's lamb vindaloo a notoriously extremely spicy Indian dish and it looks to be big old chunks of lamb I don't know if I've ever had Frozen lamb I haven't been around this big old world enough Summers to have had the opportunity I don't think all right let's try this out that was just pure fat that was just a cube of fat I was going to choke it down and I was like you know I'm I'm eating a lot today maybe I don't need to HK down this fat um I was like oh this is so tender and fat oh no this is just fat pretty tender a little dry kind of like the chicken from the chicken T Masala not very gy that fat was gy because that's usually where the gness lives in lambs and the fat so you're getting a little bit of the gaminess cuz there is fat with the meat that's a good thing I I like a little bit of game I like to be gamed it's not like starting to sweat spicy but it is like properly spicy it has heat to it nothing super special about it but nothing like bad or objectionable I that's another seven I think that's a seven papusas I love saying it papoa which is a fried corn cake if I'm not mistaken chicken cheese and green chili pusas stuffed corn tortillas filled with chicken mozzarella mozzarella cheese and green chilies that's fine mozzarella is a fine replacement for Waka which is I think they would what they normally use in this so my first Pusa I'd say of 2024 if I'm being honest ow they taste authentic like the the the papoa itself tastes authentic like it's really corny it's mucho Masa and the filling just is like mush it doesn't really have a I only taste corn I don't taste pablanos I don't taste chicken I don't taste cheese they're tasty they're good I like them but they're also just upsettingly boring and the inside is just mush which that's kind of normal for pusas I don't know I'm starting to lose the this is number 31 and I'm starting to lose take a step back how does this taste as a food item it's fine it's not great I'm going to give it a five because it's just okay it's got a solid texture five five five we have the chicken burrito bowl seasoned chicken breast with brown rice black beans red quinoa cheddar cheese and corn with the Chipotle Southwest style sauce oh great if it's healthy what is this white is that the chicken oh boy that's a bummer I don't care for that oh there's quinoa I didn't ask to be healthy I just wanted to eat let's try some of this chicken it's got a dangler on it that's very upsetting that you know nobody wants to see that that's not a good look very Bland tastes like they boiled it that's boiled chicken that's how you did things things during in the Dust Bowl you know you just boil it quinoa actually has kind of a nice chewy texture and the sauce and cheese stuff is fine so like the papusas were just food these this has a ton of flavor but objectionable textures so we got like a seven flavor and like a three texture so this is also going to be five chicken burrito bowl we have Chile reos cono or cheese stuffed Bano Peppers that have been deep fried in a light Airy batter and I am thrilled to report to you this sound this has been babish Nico heated up this uh these things these elements separately in the oven and this appears to be quite crisp let's see what the inside what Stories the inside has to tell oh my God oh my God it is just loaded with cheese wow why why well that's spectacular I have made homemade chilles reos that I can't even say right I have made them worse than this I put a lot of time effort and attention into some chilies and they've come out worse than this 10 it's incredible it's incredible the there's there's so much freaking cheese in here it's like you know we don't want them wondering is there enough cheese there's enough cheese dear God I'm going to try the sauce on its own hang on sauce is bright and tangy really well seasoned lots of garlic it's so freaking good the 10 10 the big 11 this is better than the other tens everything should go down a point and this should go up this is fantastic it's made me doubt myself as a chef person a man all right Southwest style Southwest Airlines style chicken quesadilla come on that's a good one come on Spirit Airlines chicken quesadilla okay Southwest is a little better but there's still a cattle call you got to go you got to like when they have like you know zones one through five all the way up to like Zone 25 and you stand by those like the numbers the numbers and it makes me feel like an animal yeah anyway this is the Southwest style chicken quesadilla it looks thicker than I am after this day of of consumption do how' you do this quad stove top uh so yeah I did a combination I like heat it in the oven and then finished it with a seum stove oh wow see normally I would just go microwave sear but you went oven sear Nico is a professional chef all right Southwest style chicken quesadilla thicking tortilla it's so thick look how thick that tortilla is you see how thick it is yeah it's like a double tortilla quesadilla it's more Saucy and less cheesy than I would like a ques quad be not the end of the world that's more of a preference thing lot of cilantro I'm try I'm going to try to ignore that it's it's one of the better tortillas I've ever had it's a fantastic tortilla the fillings not awesome like it's not bad but it's not blowing me away the tortilla is what's pretty nuts it's too thick but it's like a homemade tortilla Which is pretty incredible I'm going to give it an eight it's really tasty it's just not quite right yeah tastes like an upgraded kudoba bean rice and cheese burritos they got wise to the game and they put some rice in their in their burrito what a dite why why do burritos get so hot why do they do it I'm just going to do some hard nose breath though so just uh I don't know how to feel about this cuz the the the filling is perfectly tasty but it's got frozen burrito itis in that it's got a really tough chewy tortilla and there's too much of it like the ends of this here I'm going to take an illustrative bite that's the as end of this tortilla I mean as far as a bean rice and cheese microwave burrito goes it's it's it's a as good as you can do which is a seven I'll give it a seven chicken ketos what' you do oven yep just oven well these smell corny as the day is long they smell very [Applause] corny before I look at the box please don't be chicken don't be chicken cuz it's mush on the inside and not good mush yeah that chicken is goo it is it's pulped you know it's like they're about to make paper out of it I'm not even picking up on the chicken or any of the fillings what else is in this there's no cheese in this it's just chicken well no wonder it sucks there's no there's no chilies there's no there's no um cheese there's no cheese in these taquitos yeah they just taste like corn tortillas with chicken mush inside of them I don't care for that at all I'm going to give these a three well black bean and cheese and just to make sure I give them a fair Shake I'm going to start from the middle work my way out just like in the joint okay huge Improvement on the flavor honestly almost the same texture as the chicken which is saying something that chicken is Pulp and this at least is a little creamy from the beans and the cheese and the beans are well seasoned uh they taste like reff fried black beans almost Market Improvement still not great still not like worth leaving your wife for it they're they're just whatever I'm going to give these a five they're they're not good they're not bad jalapeno and cream cheese crispy wons so it's crab rangon without the crab is what I'm to infer you you don't have a story for these they aren't any they don't belong to any culture uh these look a bit of a sorry sight compared to the ones on the box but hey that's food crispy around the edges is starting to get a little soggy towards the center and they're quite tasty and they have a little bit of spice I was I was about to be like but they're not spicy but they are they're a little spicy they're like a jalapeno they're a jalapeno popper basically they're jalapeno popper one time why didn't they call it that we'll never know I bet they'd be even better with that sauce but they're good the center of them is a little upsettingly soggy but the rest of it perfectly crisp and Flaky we're ending on a on an above average To Mediocre note seven for these guys there we have it folks 38 different Frozen snacks and Entre from Trader Joe and a shocking number of them were pretty awesome I think I might have taken something or overdone my medication because I gave out six ES five NES and two 10 I'm starting to doubt my own rubric here um well regard no these were reallying good this damn well could have been from a restaurant like it wasn't the best orange chicken I've ever had but the fact that it came out of a bag is incredible this was the crispiest beef and broccoli I've ever had I've had beef and broccoli from restaurants that is not crispy at all it's complete SOG Fest and this stuff was actually crispy the only reason it's not a 10 is because of the broccoli this tasted exactly like a homemade Bea like it is it was spiced correctly the beef was nice and tender and it had plenty of fat floating on top to fry your tortillas the chanam masula was is indistinguishable from what you'd get from an Indian takeout place this stuff with the exception of some bouncy shrimp had an incredible flavor lots and lots of complexity and spice to it and the um the rice tasted like freshly fried rice this also indistinguishable I almost want to downgrade this to a nine cuz it was really good but it wasn't like incredible this was incredible like cuz like the the these two are in League with each other this is indistinguishable from from an Indian restaurant this is indistinguishable from a Thai restaurant am I saying that Tha is better than Indian I'm not saying that are you saying that Steve I would never then why won't you let me downgrade this to a nine it it doesn't deserve a 10 this deserves a 10 because it's it might have been the best Chile reano I've I've I've ever had and I've and I've made ones that are that are Miles worse than this so this well and truly deserves a 10 this I do think deserves a nine these all are welld deserving of nines and then we got six more with eights so in spite of the issues that that might uh uh uh plague Trader Joe's uh they make some really in well they don't make they work with some really incredible manufacturers to provide really incredible products at a very reasonable price and them's the facts so what do we learn today there's a lot of really good stuff in the freezer aisle at Trader Joe's however you might feel about them they got some really good products that are really reasonable rate so I hope you guys give these a try for yourselves let me know what you think let me know what I missed and let me know what you want to see me rank next thank you so much for watching and have a happy whatever time of year it is that you watch this I assume it's 2025 now happy New Year unless when this come out it has to be happy New Year [Music],I wanted to see her but what you don't know where she is exactly the town's landscape is your only clue yeah hello there welcome back to another episode of anime with Alvin today we're going to be making the tonkatsu bento box from one of my favorite anime movies of all time your name now in the movie this is a typical train bento box you can find in Japan it's called ubben or ento it's kind of like a quick lunch or something that you might buy for a long bullet train ride which can last anywhere from an hour to a couple and the rule number one that I learned in Japan is It's always important to have something to eat with you on the train no matter how full you are you're always going to want it now these eimen are typically not super expensive anywhere between $6 and $10 and also aren't considered the most super Gourmet thing they've often been pre-prepared and kind of have been sitting there but in the film it looks absolutely delicious just as shinkai Makoto always makes his food look so we made sure to get a couple while we were taking some bullet trains across Japan and we actually got two this time just because both were tonkatsu and I kind of wanted to see which one was better one of them was really dry and just didn't really have a lot of meat it was mostly just breading and just super tough and just not good at all but the other one was surprisingly good it almost tastes like they made it 15 minutes before I had purchased it the rice was still fresh and the meat was not cold and not tough and not soggy it was actually very very delicious provided the correct sustenance for this bullet train ride and I was very very happy I was able to have this experience while in Japan and that alone inspired me to come home and want to make this so because it is a tonkatsu Bento the main star of the show is the tonkatsu itself a deep fried pork loin with panco breadcrumbs usually served with a sauce over some rice now in the US you don't really kind of get the same pork that you do in Japan it usually comes in just Al loin with all the fat removed whereas in Japan tonkatsu is often usually made with a cut of pork that includes not only the loin but the fat cap and kind of like a nice little tender part of meat around it that's what kind of everybody's favorite part is we were unfortunately only able to get just the loin I will still make it work so I'm going to take this entire pork loin and S this into roughly 2 in rounds because this is going to get pounded out to help tenderize the meat a little bit if the meat somehow has tough membranes and stuff I like to sort of score the surface or any of the membranes to allow the meat to loosen once you start slamming it with a metal tool of your choice okay once I have pounded my meat out thoroughly now it's important to Salt the meat as well really season that meat before we start to bread it just some salt this is how flat the cutlet like to look cuz it's going to get a little bit bigger when it fries so I'm going to let these kind of sit on the side until I'm ready to work with them again okay now for my favorite part of making tonkatsu the tonkatsu sauce a lot of restaurants have their own version of this you can also buy it but I think a good tonkatsu really lives and D by not only the pork quality but the sauce tonkatsu sauce is a nice sweet and sour sauce that usually has some fruits and vegetables to kind of add to the flavor of the sauce itself for our version I'm going to cut up a carrot a whole whole Apple a whole tomato about a half of a white onion actually let's just do the whole thing why not and some prunes about like five or six of those chop those roughly because this is going to get cooked down and Blended later we're going to start with a medium saucepan throw all those nice fruits and vegetables in there kind of simmer that until it starts to get soft once that's good I'm going to add in about 200 g of soy sauce 200 g of sugar 50 g of rice vinegar and about 100 G of wor seere sauce this will get adjusted to taste at the end so it's not super important the initial quantity this is going to simmer for about 15 to 20 minutes until it is getting nice and soft and then we're going to take an immersion blender and blend it until it is smooth now I didn't mind taking any of those skins from the apples and leaving them in there because one it adds flavor and two we're also going to strain this out through a SI pressing that through so that any of those hard bits that's left behind what is remaining is a nice delicious somewhat thick tonkatsu sauce if it's too sweet add some more vinegar if it's not wor to shery enough you add some more of that this is the stage where you can adjust it to the way that you like it okay on to the breadcrumbs now instead of just using dried panco breadcrumbs or normal Italian breadcrumbs in Japan it's common to use fresh panco breadcrumbs or breadcrumbs made from actual bread like shokan and since we can't really buy that prepackaged here what you can do you go to the store any of those Asian bakeries you get either milk bread or shouan you can Blitz it kind of roughly in a food processor not too fine though what's the best part is if you have these little shreds of bread that kind of create these nice Jagged stag ties of crusty stuff after you've been frying them so so once we Blitz that crust in it all you can take the crust out if you want I just don't want to waste food our milk bread snow is ready for battering it so to get our frying station set up I'm going to crack about six eggs I know that might seem overkill for two pork fillets but we're going to use these later do not worry it's going to be a fun time today we going to first sprinkle some flour over these pork chops until they're nice and dusted making sure to Pat until all the excess flour comes off dunk them in the egg and coat them in a nice thick coat of these fresh bread crumbs pressing it to make sure that as much sticks to it as possible possible and then letting it sit on a rack or heat up our oil obviously there's a lot of leftover breadcrumbs and eggs we're going to turn that into something fun right after this so I'm just going to let that sit for about 5 minutes so that any of that excess coating can adhere to the pork chop and so while that's happening I'm going to thinly slice up some cabbage kind of helps you digest and is known to make the fattier greasier things go down and add a nice refreshing crunch to your food this is also seen in the tonkatsu Bento Box in your name so I'm going to hand cut this slicing as suddenly as possible to get tread because you're going to be eating this raw once that's done we're also going to just slice up some pickled radish that we got at the store this thing is quite large I think it the yellow is just food coloring but it's just a nice pickled element to eat with your fried food so we're just going to cut up a couple slices of that okay once the oil has been heated to 350° we're going to fry each cutlet for about 5 to 7 minutes until nice and golden brown once removing It season immediately with salt and just admire those nice bits and crackly parts of the fried bread pieces that we used instead of just using normal breadcrumbs cuz that would be very very very different in appearance once that rests we're going to go ahead and assemble our Bento first I'm going to just take some rice that we cooked off to the side not super important put that at the bottom of our bento box which is actually quite long then a nice bed of our thinly sliced cabbage right on top of that the heat from the rice should slowly cook the Cabbage slightly so it's not super super super raw and then we're going to slice our tonkatsu up into little thick slices probably about 3/4 of an inch long I tend to like them on the bigger side and because this is quite a long box I'm actually going to use about one a whole cutlet and about 70% of the other cutlet to kind of fill out this box don't worry those leftover pieces will be put to good use as well then just like the movie I'm going to spoon sauce approximately over half of the cutlet allowing the excess sauce to drip onto the cabbage and down into the rice below which should be quite delicious then I'm going to garnish the top with a few just simple sliced scallions assemble our radishes in the corner along with a pickled Plum or Umi as that will also help cut down on the fattiness from our fried foods and I present to you our version of the tonkatsu train bento box from your name a welcome snack I'm sure for any traveler going off to try and save the world from ruin but also just a nice meal to have more to give out all right let's give it a try let's get a piece of this pork from the Middle with some sauce with some rice and yeah it is kind of tough you can't really do too much about it because pork coin on its own is very lean and very tough and usually this is kind of the thing you would want to enjoy with high quality pork chop meat but you can't always get that and that's totally fine because the sauce and the crust and the rice all together make up for that in its entirety still super delicious I'm glad everybody in the studio got to come down and try some and this is where things start to get fun because you do have a lot of leftover ingredients from making this both cooked and uncooked so I had a couple of ideas first things first let's take those random pieces of leftover cutlet that have just been sitting there since we didn't get to use them let's cut them into just little Cube like pieces roughly chopped and set them aside then I'm going to cut up the rest of our scallions that we bought for this probably about three or four of those and some radish that we also have left over in small cubes all right now let's get to some fun stuff in a walk I'm going to toast a little bit of butter until it is about slightly Brown and then I'm going to take the remaining breadcrumbs from the frying process and throw that in and toast them evenly until the breadcrumbs are nice and crispy then I'm going to remove all those breadcrumbs and pour in a little bit of oil so that we can fry up the remaining amount of beaten egg that we used in the battering process as well there's probably about 4 and 1/2 eggs in here so that's a good amount I'm going to fry this up walk style which means high heat let it Bubble Up and almost turn into a pancake before breaking it up into small bits and this is the important part when it comes to walk frying eggs for something that I'm going to be making right now is that I like to kind of crush these up into little bits slow frying them until all the water comes out so you're not getting fluffy eggs you're getting crispy fried shards of eggs almost like crispy ground beef this actually takes quite some time because you have to break up all those chunks and essentially watch the eggs turn into these little Shard bits that start to dance from the heat of the Walk cuz that doesn't happen to all the water is gone and that's when the aroma of those egg yolks start to fry and come out really really deliciously once this is ready I'm going to throw in some leftover cabbage that we had on the side that I also chopped up give that a little bit of a nice coloring on it and then I'm going to throw in those pork cutlet pieces that I cut up earlier frying that up as well then to season I'm going to add some MSG sugar and salt and approximately a 1: 1 to2 ratio is what I've learned and then I'm going to add in all the leftover rice that we had from the rice cooker from the Bento Box this is just going to get thrown in and if you can't guess it by now yes we are making fried rice the goal here is to also break up all the large clumps that every single grain of rice has been coated by any of the oil and the flavors from the remaining things in the pan and it's going to start sizzling and cooking on its own we don't want any clumps here so I'm alternating between a moving around process with a walk Ladle as well as a smashing down process to kind of break up any of those lumps and make sure that this whole entire thing as my friend Eric calls it who owns a toese restaurant Lily Fleming where each gain of rice is almost coated in oil and Cooks like steak which is pretty delicious so after all the rice has been broken up we're going to finally add a couple spoonfuls of our tonkatsu sauce cuz we made a lot of it this is going to go Sizzle on the edge of the walk and then we're going to slowly incorporate it in until the sauce is nice and deliciously seared okay once this is almost done we're going to add in radishes and scallions that we cut up earlier about 90% towards the end and just kind of let that warm through we don't want to cook this down or get soggy this is just mainly trying to break the rawness of it but also add a nice bit of bite in greenness to our dish okay so I present to you some leftover katsudon fried rice made with the leftover pork cutlet leftover breadcrumbs and the eggs where the breadcrumbs are going to be nice crispy garnish and everything else just kind of gets turned into fried rice but should be delicious because well how can this not be upon tasting it this is in fact confirmed quite delicious I approve I think my my friend Eric would also approve as well everybody that tried it also approved so I think it's fair to say uh Mak can fried rice with this kind of food is uh approved if you do it right this whole thing actually took about 30 minutes because frying the eggs and the rice to get it crispy took at least 20 to 25 minutes speaking of my friend Eric one of the dishes that he serves at his restaurant 886 is stir fried cabbage with bacon which sounds rather interesting but is actually way greater than the sum of its parts because he has access to really good cabbage and really good bacon and we're just using normal store-bought cabbage and bacon because we have so much cabbage left over I kind of wanted to make something a little bit healthier out of it so yeah we're going to add bacon first I'm going to cut up an entire pack of thick cut bacon I'm going to slice with about four garlic cloves very very thinly into rounds then we're just going to render all the Bacon Fat out into the pan just by cooking the bacon in the walk itself till it is slightly crispy I don't want the bacon crispy all the way through then I'm going to approximately drain half of that fat I'm going to throw in our garlic until it is barely starting to Brown on the outsides and then our cabbage we just took all the leftover cabbage that we had cut them into roughly big chunks and just threw it in and tossed it and and make sure that each piece of cabbage is separate and is coated deliciously and baked in garlic flavor once it's looking pretty good I'm going to add in a pretty heavy dose of MSG probably about a tablespoon or so the stuff is delicious and once this is almost ready to go once again finish with a tablespoon or so of the leftover ton KATU sauce add a little bit of moisture kind of bring everything together and add some acidity to this dish that's it pretty simple plate it up this is just stir-fried cabbage with bacon sounds simple because it is but it's somehow greater than the sum of its parts in many ways obviously still very different than a restaurant version but aish inspired me to kind of turn cabbage into something more exciting this way and we had some bacon and that always is something that people love so yeah that's what we did with the leftovers from today's shoot and we packed home everything that we made today there was a lot of people in the studio and we made sure to divy it up not so evenly I guess but made sure that everybody had some nice presents to take home with them and enjoy for dinner or just immediately in the car I don't know how people do that but have fun,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

and also gets you an exclusive 50% off your first [Music] order Jesus this is actually good good yeah the Egg Bar is Coveted as [ __ ] hey what's up guys welcome back to binging with babish where this week we're taking a look at the egg bar from Severance this being one of the more coveted Perks at Lumen Industries how do we go about making an egg bar that's coveted as F we must of course begin with the Precision poaching of eggs as you can see I got about 2 quarts of water just barely boiling around 190° F which is going to more gently poach the eggs today we're going to need both soft and and hardboiled eggs the four more of which is going to take about 6 minutes and for a nice fudgy hardboiled yolk I'm letting the ladder go for 10 before immediately plunging in an ice bath which is both going to Halt cooking and make the eggs easier to peel especially after they've spent 30 minutes in the cold plunge we're going to start by trying to make as many small cracks as possible all over the egg and I'm peeling these with gloves on both because a lot of people are going to eat them and because they're going to help prevent our fingernails from gouging any holes in the exterior because for deviled eggs in particular you want nice smooth shiny round eggs give them a little dip in the water to remove any shell fragments and then it's time to tackle the first of two types of deviled eggs regular deviled eggs and as you can see our yolks are set but not powdery or firm and none of the dreaded green that comes with Overcoat yolks gently press the yolk out of the white leaving us with clean cholesterol-free cups and a bowl full of delicious creamy artery cloggers which we're going to make all the more delicious and creamy with some stuff 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard the juice of one lemon about 2 to 3 tbspoon worth and even more eggs in the form of mayonnaise start with one large egg half a clove of garlic one or two cautious blurps of Dijon mustard a generous pinch of koser salt and lemon juice basically all the stuff that we're putting in the egg yolk mixture in a cup the same width as your immersion blender head use said head to Blitz this mixture into a smooth consistency carefully pour one cup of neutral flavored oil down the side of the cup so it settles on top of the egg mixture Blitz on high speed starting at the bottom and work your way up for a nice creamy homemade mayonnaise about 1/2 cup of which we're going to add to our eight egg yolks along with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper I also like to add a little glug of spicy fruity olive oil and a generous trickle of pickle juice about 1 to two 2 tablespoons each now we're going to whip This Together using a wire whisk into a creamy filling for our egg white cups now this doesn't need to be perfectly smooth but I was a little bothered by the lumps of unincorporated egg yolk so I'm passing this mixture through a fine mesh SI which is both going to filter out and crush up any stubborn solids now at this point you can taste for seasoning and adjust for consistency by adding heavy cream the oil of Olives or the juice of pickles as well as adjust seasoning before placing in a Piping Bag and fridging for about half an hour to firm things up now all we got to do is elegantly pipe this stuff into the egg whites and garnish when it comes time to serve for now these guys can get Loosely covered with plastic wrap and fridged for up to 4 days next up the egg Bar's second type of deviled egg those wild looking purple eggs which were most likely pickled in some very blood-like beet juice so I got three jars of pickled beets here whose blood I'm going to vampiric steal two cups worth of the stuff resign myself to having to eat a whole lot of pickled beets over the next 4 to 6 weeks and bring this pickling liquid over to the stove top where we're going to make it even picker pouring them into a small saucepan along with 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar qu cup of plain white sugar 2 tbspoon of pickling spices mixture of bay leaves peppercorns mustard seeds Etc and a/ teaspoon of kosher salt bring this all to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes until the sugar is entirely dissolved then we're both going to dilute and more quickly cool this mixture using a cup of ice water once it is cooled to slightly lukewarm we're going to pour it over our hard-boiled eggs in a zip top bag for easy agitation and submersion and leaving to pickle in the fridge for anywhere from 3 days to up to 2 weeks the longer you go the further the eggs will be penetrated by the purple dye due to my needing to take a few sick days these guys were in the fridge for over a week and a half let's cut them open and see what kind of penetration we've achieved sorry I just wanted to say that as you can see the egg white has become egg purple and it's been made much firmer by the pickling process which comes in handy cuz now we have to delicately dig out the egg yolk cuz these little weirdos are served hollowed out and standing up I'm also placing a very small cut on the bottom of the egg cup so they stand up straight and there you have it something you could not pay me to eat if I didn't know what it was now I've scooped these beautiful Mona likee egg yolks directly into the bowl a food processor 10 egg yolks worth and I'm going to combine with 4 oz of goat cheese the zest of one lemon 1 teaspoon of champagne vinegar 1 teaspoon of Dijon mustard and a preliminary sprinkling of koser salt and freshly ground black pepper I'm also going to add that same little drizzle of olive oil just to introduce even more fat into the situation then just like in therapy I'm going to process this until it Smooths out give it a taste for seasoning and texture I'm going to thin mine out using a little bit of heavy cream and it wants for herbaceousness so I'm going add a little bit of dried dill which hopefully won't turn it green plop into a Piping Bag this time with a star tip and just like at the dentist I'm going to fill these cavities piping a generous swirl of our egg oranges into our egg purples likewise these can be covered in fridg for a few days before serving last up there appeared to be soft boiled eggs and soldiers so if we can't show a waffle party on this channel we can at least make some waffle soldiers to dip in our eggs I want a super Crispy Waffle so I'm going to combine 200 g of allpurpose flour with about 60 G of cornstarch which should give our waffles a firmer crunchier texture at the expense of Browning I'm also adding 3/4 of a teaspoon of kosher salt 2 teaspoon sugar 1 taspo baking powder and a/ teaspoon of baking soda whisking together the dries before adding the wets to try and compensate for the cornstarch I'm going to use brown butter in this recipe 12 tbspoon or 175 G of unsalted cooking over medium heat and swirling constantly until the milk fats separate and brown allowing to cool but still remain liquid before adding to the waffle batter make sure to scrape off all that delicious brown stuff in the bottom of the bowl 2 cups or 475 mil of Buttermilk and two large eggs whisking until no dry patches remain but it's still pretty lumpy make sure all your liquid ingredients are at room temperature or your butter is going to seize up once you have your wild New Vertical waffle iron preheated pour in a cup of the stuff and Let It Rock for an unusually long period of time ensuring a deep brown crust that won't soften or get soggy once all my waffles are done I'm placing them on a wire rack set in a rim baking sheet and keeping them warm in a 2 and 25° fhe oven where they will continue to firm and crisp this is also going to serve as a finishing rack for the final elements of our egg bar my oldest enemy Scotch eggs first up the sausage coating just like at the dermatologist I'm squeezing this girl never mind I'm combining a pound of English Banger sausage meat with a heaping teaspoon of hot mustard 1/4 cup of freshly chopped chives and 1/4 teaspoon of freshly grated nutmeg I'm now going to wrap this sausage mixture around four softboiled eggs making sure the egg is fully ins sconed and sealed shut then we're starting a Standard three-stage breading process allpurpose flour into beaten egg into plain breadcrumbs shaking off any excess before deep frying in some 375° f neutral flavored oil stirring occasionally to make sure that they're evenly cooked now unfortunately my first batch both developed cracks I suspect both both because I used a very finely ground emulsified sausage mixture and because it was too thinly wrapped around the egg for once getting a runny yolk was the least of my problems so not only did these guys crack I wasn't crazy about their flavor and texture I wanted more Herby breakfasty flavors in my sausage so I decided to start from scratch with a pound of nice coarsely ground pork to which I'm adding a teaspoon of freshly chopped Thyme and a tablespoon each fresh sage and chives the usual sprinkles of ker salt and freshly ground black pepper and I'm also going to spice things up a little bit with a tiny pinch each all spice mace Ginger powder garlic powder and freshly grated nutmeg I'm also going to add about a teaspoon of hot dry mustard now this time I wanted to get things mixed up but not over mixed I want to form a strong network of proteins so the sausage doesn't break apart but not overwork it to the point where it shrinks too much if you want you can fry up a little Patty of this stuff to test seasoning so this time I'm using a pound of meat to coat three eggs instead of four and this time when I seal it shut I am noing around I'm stretching and smearing the meat over any potential cracks and allowing these guys to rest in the fridge for 30 minutes before breading and frying and then just as one more fail safe I'm also going to double bread these guys starting by Coating in flour followed by egg followed by breadcrumbs back to egg and then one more time in the breadcrumbs hopefully yielding a crack proof crust this time I'm also using more oil so that the egg gets completely covered and I also brought along a line of glazer and their husband for good luck what you don't believe me see but even with all that my eggs still cracked desperate and hungry and afraid I decided to try something that's worked for me in the past using panko breadcrumbs which is going to give a nicer crust anyway just doing a single coat this time very thoroughly pressing the breadcrumbs into the sausage getting as many as can physically fit on there I'm not sure why I thought this would fix the problem but it's what my heart was saying to do and just like at the cardiologist I was trying to listen to my heart I'm also frying these guys at 350° F instead of 375 and either that or the breadcrumbs caused the cracks to stop occurring yielding two perfect giant golden dragon eggs which like I mentioned earlier are going to get finished off in the oven next to the waffles that's everything so now it's time to Plate up garnish and serve I'm sprinkling the debled eggs with smoked paprika and chopped chives and it looks like the Beet deviled eggs were garnished with a single leaf of Teragon which is going to play real nice with all those flavors so there's our cold eggs now it's time for the hot I'm chopping up the nice crispy waffles into individual soldiers and I intended to Poise a bunch of softboiled eggs in these cute little egg cups this is how they actually arrive from Amazon so it's going to be more like one single proud softboiled egg which was prepared by simmering the egg for 6 minutes then running it under cold tap water for 30 seconds which should cool it off enough to Halt the cooking process but keep it nice and warm for serving chop off the top exposing the set white and runny yolk stack up some soldiers alongside then as a sauce for the Scotch eggs I made a 50/50 mix of our homemade mayo and grain mustard now just like at the doctor we're going to check our huos the sausage is fully cooked and the yolks are still nice and runny and there you have it the coveted Egg Bar perk which I was so excited about finally finishing I completely forgot to make the fruit punch so just pretend there's a big punch bowl of Kool-Aid next to this please first up the waffle soldiers and softboiled egg and I'm happy to say that this combination works really really well the waffles are super crisp on the outside but they're like a dense sule on the inside and they make for quite a hearty egg Dipper the Scotch eggs in spite of giving me the usual amount of trouble turned out to be worth the effort with really well balanced seasoning flavors and textures our big old pickled beet eggs are best eaten in two to three bites are really fantastically delicious the Briney beets and Rich goat cheese work together about as well as you'd imagine and even though they're the most plain Jane of the bunch the classic devil eggs tick all the devil egg boxes overall a wide variety of demonstrations of just how good eggs can be and hopefully one of those perks that would make being an in

dumplings in my freezer I thought that would be a a a dream even to my grandchildren but no today and oh God it's so nice to be back to where I can read boxes steam dumplings also known as xia long ba originated in the xangan region of China they are traditionally made with por con steamed and small bamboo steamer baskets our version comes in a convenient microwavable steamer tray each dumpling packs a strong punch of flavor due to the copious amounts of Ginger that wasn't as fun as I was hoping I think that after you know back when this was Trader Mings because that's what it was was until a couple years ago I think they're probably steering clear of any kind of l so I'm going to eat this like a proper soup dump put it in a spoon and I'm going to pierce it there is a little bit of liquid in there I kind of want to pour it out for demonstration I can pour it in the spoon that way it's not gross there we go look at that oh there we go look at that just pissing out right there it's just kind of excreting all right it's got a little soup in there those are fantastic um the wrapper is definitely gummier than like a you know freshly made soup there was a frozen soup though what am I what am I what am I Count Dooku that's uh Star Wars Star Wars prequels reference right there that's for you they taste really good they're a little tiny tiny tiny bit undersalted but like they they weren't lying there's a punch of ginger in there there's a full punch and um it's it's really good I'm going to give these in eight we're starting off real strong they're very tasty I encourage you guys to eat one of these they're not too hot too you shove the whole thing your right in your gullet it's like a seagull or not a seagull a um what's the one with the Pelican ah just just like a pelican all right next up we have chai which is a Korean stir fried potato glass noodle with vegetables any stories on here nope again they're not rolling those dice they're like you know here's the food we're not going to editorialize it at all it's just this is the food doesn't say authentic anywhere what what would what would okay they used to call Trader Mexican Trader Joe stuff Trader Jose's uh Chinese Trader Joe stuff Trader Mings what would they call Trader Joe's Korean audience leave a comment cuz I'm not going to do it okay really great noodle texture super bouncy chewy just the way I like him needs more everything it's very Bland tasting down H look down look down all right so yeah no these are uh uh great texture but very undersalted needs something needs soy sauce I don't remember what goes in chai but like whatever it is it needs it uh it at the very least it needs salt um but hey you can do that you you you got time on your hands right I mean you saved some by microwaving this thing did you guys microwave this or bake it or what microwave uh yeah no if you're looking for a gluten-free noodle option can't do much better than this these have a fantastic texture some of them are really chewy and bouncy some aren't it's good but it it needs stuff it there's lots of room for improvement I'll give these a six am I mean am I heartless I'll give these a six yes I am mean and heartless beef tamales uh wrapped in corn husks Trader Joe's no funny business you want stories and anecdotes look at the mac and cheese and the Italian stuff inspected and passed by the Department of Agriculture culture you don't see that every day on food I've in fact I don't think I've ever seen that I appreciate it that's good to know there's cilantro in it these I think were microwaved so just bear that in mind these look like good to moles all I have her Chopsticks in a spoon and uh ooh it's hot now oh smoking those was pretty good um again a little under salted might be an illusion because it's so hot don't know if you know that but Foods taste less salty when they're super hot little known fact Kendall taught it to me so I actually don't know if it's like true but it's been my experience and isn't that the only objective fact is subjective experience that's the grand irony so these are good the the the texture is solid they're not as like El Dente as I would like for them to be I don't know I wonder what the what what Spanish is for Al Dente Google's just like you mean Italian right all right Spanish for to some delicios stupid stupid stupid um I wish they were more alente they not uh but the the the flavor solid again maybe slightly undersalted let me try some now that it's cooled off a little bit you know it hasn't I mean my biggest complaint is hard to eat with chopsticks yeah no could use a little bit of salt but like you're going you're going to Sauce this right nothing special but nothing bad is that a six no it's it's it's solid it tastes like like there's no it doesn't taste like preservative it's got a decent texture it's got a good flavor it's loaded with beef how much does this cost $429 for two tamales that's that's a little that's a little that's a little but whatever they're good I'll give them a seven scall and pancakes or pum keep frozen that's all we have to say we're going to put some decorative flowers on the outside but these are agnostic this could be wallpaper in your mom's house or it could be a beautiful lotus flower in a culturally appropriate just just pleas just eat this just just enjoy the pancakes it's fine um wow they feel a little crispy were these microwaved oh well that makes more sense cuz they're a little crispy that's definitely going to be the way to heat these up because they definitely feel crisp and they would definitely be mushy if you mik waved them let's see what happens M that's good now these are fantastic um they're thin enough that they're mostly crust so they just pretty much just have a fantastic te texture scall and pancakes usually pretty mushy in the side anyway try a little bit on its own just uh to be agnostic again UND salted but you're dipping it in liquid salt soy sauce so that's fine these are delicious I'm going to give them an eight they're very good skying pancakes all right next up we have cheese and green chili tamales wrapped in corn husks keep frozen and it looks like they do indeed have green chilies and it looks ooh look at that cheesy stretchy cheesiness look at that oh yeah just got interesting okay let's see what we're dealing with here what maybe I'm just salt blind or something cuz I feel like everything's been undersalted thus far this feels undersalted but you threw some salsa on there uh we found out the actual word for um tooth Sim in Spanish which is sabrosa which frankly sounds beautiful um these are quite tasty they need something Sala but so do most tamales uh same solid texture I like the filling better it tastes kind of like hatch chilies or or pablano chilies they're very flavorful nice chilies just a bare suggestion of heat solid amount of melty nice melty cheese great texture great tamale I'm going to give these a do they deserve an eight I'm going to give these a uh I'm going to give them a seven they're bump up oh we have our first double feature ladies and gentlemen just like the old days the drive-in we have our F we have we have vegan tikka masala what the hell are these objects in it if it's not vegan meat substitute soy meat in a a Tika Masala sauce it looks not like Tika Masala if I'm being honest maybe once I mix it up and I get that Oil Incorporated and I'm having it with a Tor naan this is imported authentic that's you're you're treading a fine line but where was it made that's what I want to know product of India pretty hard to say it's yeah no yeah you know what it's authentic this is real so uh all right we have an authentic naan and we have a vegan Tikka mage Sal everything today will be eaten with chapsticks this is a really oily uh tial I'm trying to reincorporate the oil into the sauce and it is fighting me it's fighting me like a like a like a big mouth bass it doesn't want to get reeled in but I am stronger there we go that also looks crazy hot so I'm just going to dig right in okay who might have just had a little bit too much time in the oven but that's okay uh so the soy nuggets are terrible they have what I would describe as a bouncy slippery texture no if if this If This Were chicken I would call the hospital because I'd be like I just ate chicken that's clearly you know has rabies and I'm going to die a couple hours ago and uh they'd be like sir you know it's just soy prot isolate and i' I'd be like this na is a little dry can you please send the police Na's a little dry might have just spent a little bit too much time in the oven it's also not very toothsome it's very tender what what's the Indian word for toothsome Hindi word for toothsome is mazadar it's not very mazadar it's pretty pretty tender uh and a little so not like a na that you'd get from a restaurant those things are positively stretchy you got to you got you got to put some put some whatever these muscles are into tearing those in half but this okay that didn't look just trust me it's a little they're they're tender uh the sauce is okay so oily even after incorporating the oil it's separating again so much oil I didn't try the rice let's let's see what the rice is all about it looks not very good oh once it mix it up it looks better all right the the rice is like pretty well cooked it is aromatic Basmati it has that lovely Jasmine flavor and um the only really bad thing about this is the pro protein chunks I won't be so mean I'll give the naan a five and I'll give this a four cuz this is not so great and I even though this isn't the best na I've ever had I would keep eating it it's bread it's fine all right next up we have roasted eggplant Curry very hard to eat with chapsticks sorry I'll use a spoon H interesting ooh it's spicy okay that is well seasoned it really tastes like distinctly of eggplant despite the fact that there's a billion spices and a solid amount of heat in there like I'd rate this on a spicy scale jalapeno it's it's it's showing up it's punched in imagine it's pretty good for you too yeah buddy 310 calories in this container only 26 GS of carbs 5 g of protein whatever 23 g of fat from what from what oh okay the fourth ingredient is oil there's a lot of oil in this fine whatever I don't care th this is really tasty but it's like you know it's a one trick pony but it's really good it does its one trick very well so I'm GNA give it I'm gonna give it an eight okay butter chicken the chicken your mama warned you about not sure what that means oh it smells delightful I'm going to try the sauce first on its own tastes distinctly of cinnamon pretty good um the chicken is let's see hot a little dry but it doesn't have that like freezer Funk to it um it's tasty it's really very like cinnamon all spice forward there's some warming spice that's attacking me right now but I like it I asked it to you know the only issue with it is that the chicken's dry I would give it an eight no it's good and spicy too I'd give it a nine if the chicken were like great but I think this is going to be an eight because the sauce is really quite good solid as rock next up we have a Taiwanese green onion pancakes ready to cook oh we have a story Trader Joe's green onion pancakes are just like what you might get at a traditional dimsum meal quickly fried these Savory discs become crispy and Flaky and can be eaten on their own as a snack or used as part of a meal it's a great tip uh try using them in place of a tortilla or non to wrap meats or vegetables that's actually a great that sounds delicious really great uh nice and Flaky good layers good noises when I when I manipulate them like this let's try it out much cheerer a lot more there must be like in Taiwanese style they must use more of a flour or something because there's a lot of yeah the top ingredient is flour and there's there's gluten development it's got chew to it toothsomes the Italians have 12 words for alente no I'm kidding it's just like they said um what uh es Eskimos Inuit have like 30 words for snow I was just trying to make an Eskimos have 30 words for snow joke to some Howe you're welcome uh these are these are good and howw um I'm definitely saying that wrong uh but on their own without the soy sauce virtually no flavor I barely taste green onion if at all it mostly just tastes like flour this would indeed make a fantastic wrap for meats or veggies as suggested by the container but on its own as a scallion pancake it's not as tasty as the other ones it just has a way better texture these are a seven you dip these in some soy sauce with some sesame oil and some chili crisp or something you're you're you're you're walk on Sunshine oh you're walking on sunshine pad seeu stir fried Thai rice noodles with vegetables tofu and soy sauce I love Padu uh and given Trader Joe's history uh of of Frozen noodle Acumen I think that these are going to be quite good let's see if I have to look up another word for toothsome bummer bummer I do high word for toome erod oroy definitely pronouncing that correctly which simply means delicious stop it Google AI I'm not looking for the word for delicious I'm looking for the word for tosm great this place has has a translation but it's just the Thai text there's no there's no pronunciation guide for people like me so it's not this enough long story short the noodles are pretty mushy they're not toothsome as as I would like them to be they they they're let me try another one just in case I got a lemon that one was better cuz it was folded over multiple times so it had that like you know you know when pasta sticks together it gets extra chewy had that going on but the noodles the single sheet noodles they're dead in the water super soft flavor's okay carrots are mushy look the bach Choy I assume Really mushy and watery tofu is nice and soft and and tender that's cool really oily I mean pad is really oily it is an oily dish so I'm not going to hold that against it but I'm going to hold everything else against it and I'm going to give it a five I I would feel like that was a waste of calories if I ate this whole bowl shoot trying to watch my language recently sorry sorry about the shoot but there actually Papas Reas wow I went from saying it really wrong to really right crispy mashed potatoes stuffed with seasoned ground beef is this a real dish or is it some sort of Traer generian invention yeah no these are a pop popular Latin American croquet very cool something I had not heard of until today I'm committing o yeah that worked out really well so let's take a look at that cross-section we got a little smidgen of beef in there whole bunch of Tater looks like some Saucy sauce or something let's see what it tastes like this tastes exactly like there's this sandwich restaurant in my hometown called dellas and they have a sandwich they call it their sandwich oil it's like it's like a it's like an Italian oil basically it's got oil with herbs in it and that's what this tastes like like precisely did you bake these Nico uh yes that's why they're so crispy they're very very soft but they're like so etheral it's like I can't they're halfway between mushy and fluffy there it is that's better the outside is really fantastically crisp for having been ovened rather than deep fried so these these reconstituted it very very well and um the flavor well again strange for me is objectively quite good there's a lot less beef than depicted on the on the box but whatever that's boxes for you so any any any story here do I get a little blurb no not today okay I'm going to give these a jeez I'm going to give am I going to give everything an eight does everything get an eight today no these are fine they're going to get a seven these are a seven not because I'm not trying to give out too many eights perhaps I'm being a little loose with my eights today got to tighten up the eights what have we got here vegetable pad TI one of the more difficult dishes to make yourself at home because you need you know wild stuff like shrimp paste and Tamarind paste all them kinds of pastes and uh so so to be able to uh make in the convenience comfort and convenience of your house smells real good it looks a hell of a lot like pad tie great sign try to get a little bit of everything here super hot I wish there other peanuts in it there's got to be peanuts cashews oh man they used cashews instead of peanuts I don't know if that's like an attempt to get around peanut allergies or if that's a also a tradition thing but usually when I get pad tie there's peanuts on it so this will be interesting there's definitely tartness so they must add citric acid or something cuz I didn't see lime juice really it it feels the way it looks it's very Gloppy in the mouth and the flavor is like pad TI flavor that played a few games of telephone you know it's like yeah but also yeah it's it's I I cannot even point to what's off about it but there's something off maybe it's the cashews instead of peanuts maybe I'm missing that there might be too much citric acid like it is quite tart God the bean sprouts instead of being like crisp and and and vegetable they're mushy it's not very good it's it's uh it's not terribly bad it hasn't too much weird stuff going for it it it looks sloppy it eats sloppy tastes sloppy I'm going to give it a I'm going to give it a four it's not quite good enough to get a five we have the green chili chicken bowl shredded dark meat chicken with cilantro and seasoned rice cheddar cheese and green chili sauce this sounds an awful lot like a dish that I uh tried to design with a frozen food company when I briefly uh entertained the notion of having a a babbish line of frozen dinners but they were gross so I so we didn't do it you're welcome the dark mate chicken looks really very finely shredded damn near to with a consistency of a paste and holy  does that Rice have a lot of cilantro on it wow Nico's cooking down there Nico is doing real cooking that sounds like a grease fire happening oh I barely taste cilantro in spite of seeing piles of it this whole Bowl every aspect of it the rice the chicken the chilies the cheese all have the consistency of mush this is mush this is dog food with water added to it you know makes its own gravy that's what's happening here this has an abhorent texture the flavor's fine tastes like taco spice pretty much um I sort of taste the chilies but they taste kind of canned they have that t canned tiny acidity to them the chicken is just mush it is just slop and the rice is super soft and mushy uh and the cheese is barely there and it's kind of grainy it's it's pretty it's pretty it's pretty it's it's quite bad I'm going to give this a three I would eat it under duress and that's about it okay so next up what what do we have here it's Mandarin style orange chicken bowl now I have heard tall tal about this being pretty good it's funny that they call it mandarin orange chicken because orange chicken is an is is is is an American invention uh I mean granted by a Chinese American person but still invented in America for Panda Express so why does it say Mandarin style orange chicken am I misinformed I'm misinformed I have to imagine that Trader Joe's did their research before putting that on a box with tender battered dark chicken meat why' they say dark chicken meat why isn't it dark meat chicken I'm keeping my eye on that I'm going to keep my eye on that so I have heard that this is I I think this is one of the more popular items from the Trader Joe's freezer aisle I cannot imagine this being good like like tempura Fried Chicken Frozen and reheated in microwave I can't imagine this and it's called dark chicken meat let me keep my eye on that yeah not even a suggestion of crispness to it it is extremely mushy and I would say mostly breading I mean you know that's kind of the status quo here I'll get a big piece just to let's do a little surgery here it looks like a fair amount of chicken inside of the breading so maybe I just got a really bready bite let's try this one that's a meteor bite however you know what this tastes exactly like leftovers leftovers reheated in the microwave so why not order Chinese takeout keep the leftovers and eat those like you're already doing $4.99 all right so I mean it's relatively cheap but like damn yeah not super crazy let me try the uh broccoli just so I have a full picture I didn't even try the rice and broccoli and stuff the rice texture is like that um you know that bag of Carolina rice that you get for 19 cents and you boil it on the stove top and it's got that very distinct taste and texture to it and that's what this tastes like it has that flavor it has that texture and it's effectively been been cooked Frozen reheated so it's not even as light and fluffy as that would be to be fair I have had take out that is worse than this like I have had freshly made you know General SE or sesame chicken that that has less Chicken in it it's more breading it's chewier Ander and this is better than that so that's that's an accomplishment I can't really hold it against it that it's not crispy because it is frozen and there's a lot of it too like there a gen generous portion of of chicken in there I'm going to give it a I'm I'm going to give it a five like there's a lot of things about it that I don't like but there's nothing about it that makes me hate it I just want to say that Nico is smashing it down there he's cooking and I'm not exaggerating four or five things at once he's got two burners going he's got in the oven he's got in the microwave and to think I said he'd never amount to anything I'm sorry I never said I would never say that anywh who what do we have here we have beef bgi thinly sliced marinated beef in a sweet and savory sauce no story this did not this does not come with the rice full disclosure Nico made this rice just so we could have something he's he's he's he's a he's a wonderin beef Bogi it's not bad it doesn't taste quite like bulgogi it just sort of tastes like generic Asian sauce like here's some soy sauce and what do they put in here soy sauce oh they put par puree in here that's legit Apple puree pineapple juice garlic cornstarch it has all the the pieces in there but something's missing I don't know what it is the only thing that's reading bulgogi to me is the beef itself which is very good it's got a good texture nice and fatty was perfect I never would have guessed that it was frozen um he sauteed this so this was not microwaved it was prepared in a sauté pan so that's probably doing stuff for it it's got little crispy bits and Saucy heyd and um it's uh it's really quite good I'm conflicted because the flavor is like whatever the texture and the flavor of the beef is great the sauce is where it's sort of coming undone I don't want to give out more eights we have enough eights but I think that's what it deserves if it had a perfect sauce you know we'd be looking at a nine or a 10 but this is an eight next up we have Spicy Thai shrimp fried rice smells fantastic and this was prepared in a sauté pan so uh it's going to hopefully have more of the fried rice kind of vibe to it oh yeah if these shrimp are good we're in trouble oh w really bouncy but they've been cooked Frozen and reheated how much can I possibly expect from them the uh flavor is fantastic it is Laden with I think lemongrass is it lemongrass it's not a lemongrass but it is uh leaves which is apparently a very offensive name so just go ahead and bleep that um but that's what it says right here Trader Joe's caught you found you right there in the ingredients what Le leaves not on my watch so it's it's just it's nice and spicy too it's so flavorful it's colorful the texture is not bad at all oh that's great I'm inclined to give it I'm inclined to give it a nine if the only reason that it that it's that it's getting a nine is cuz I don't want to give out another eight that's not fair that's not a democracy the shrimp are just not very good but the rest of it is so good it's the best tasting thing I've had to nine I'm going to give it a nine the shrimp are as good as frozen shrimp can be and the rest is spectacular so I'm going to give this a nine love the flavor of this we got kungpow tempura cauliflower if I'm not mistaken this is one of the more popular joints now how' you reheat this in the microwave you bake the cauliflower and then you combine it with the sauce oh so hopefully there's a little bit of crispy action going on here the sauce smells really vinegar Ford that's cold let's try a different one oh my quote George te um that's really good well it looks like hell let's be honest this doesn't look very good but it is actually Crispy Crunchy um presentably from the baking and the flavor is really solid it still T tastes like the distinctly of cauliflower but the kungpow sauce wouldn't call that kungpow doesn't kungpow have peanuts in it as well where are the peanuts whatever it is tastes nice and good oh God I'm tempted to no the no the cauliflower is a little mushy but the the tempura crunch is better than I could have imagined it would be it is a little spicy but it looks like I think that I think that gets you an eight it really doesn't look great but it tastes is bus oh no no story damn it what a the stories go vegan Thai green curry with tofu sheets vegetables and Jasmine rice oh here we go an absolutely authentic I like that is it a product of Thailand because then that shuts my mouth right up product of Thailand if it's a product of they're saying it they don't say an authentic they say an absolutely authentic Tha green curry made with tofu sheets ready to microwave with a side of jasmine rice period absolutely authentic I believe him they held me against the wall but by my throat I said this absolutely authentic my my toes were 4 in off the ground it's like Darth Vader it looks absolutely authentic I think the the proper way to do this is not to try things separately I should probably just just do actually can I can I um what's the name of those yogurts with the cup on top where you where you that's the brand but like what what's you know it's got like a little cup of honey and you and you fold it and dump it I need to know please tell me this makes the cut cuz of what I'm about to do I'm about to F total split thiser and just kind of it's clearly not designed to do that so we'll just go ahead and wouldn't have happened with fire total splits tell you that much so that's already not doing you know oh that's good spice level great flavors uh I mean pretty hard to screw this up but that doesn't cost you points just cuz it's easy do yeah you could have told me that was tofu that was just freshly skinned you could have told me that tofu was still screaming from having been skinned the rice has a great texture it is very no that was the one where it didn't it wouldn't show me it is veryy whatever that tie word was for Al Dente nice and toothsome having a hard time finding anything wrong with it the rice does get a little mushy towards the center it's chewier toward towards the outsides it's not like this is restaurant quality then again if you serve this if I had this at a Thai restaurant I would never guess that it was frozen I'd be like this is green curry this is what I ordered why you asking me just the right amount of spice level I'm going to give it a 10 I love it well how about that beef bira slow cooked beef in a savory tomato and chili sauce this looks a lot like real beia uh if you took some tortillas and dip them in the fat and then fried them you'd have yourself you'd have you'd have yourself a beus situation let's see the beef looks like normal is stew beef let's see if this tastes like the real deal it sort of kind of does and I don't know I could be very wrong about this but I'm I'm inclined to think that this is like oxtail because or maybe it's I don't know beef rib thin little beef ribs or something the amount of connective tissue on it and its shape it's like round little nubbins and it's got It's got a ton of like um uh connective tissue on it and that that that Rings oxtail to me which is pretty dope ever so slightly spicy not very but like the flavor tastes like bira the slightest bit basic but like this is very solid bira like like I I I'm not an expert on the subject nor should you even believe anything I say ever but this to me tastes like solid beeran I'm inclined to give it a nine I can find very little wrong with it okay now we have the barbecue teriyaki chicken uh which is just a whole freaking lot of barbecue teriyaki chicken look at the sheer amount of it again this does not come with white rice Nico furnish that out of the goodness of his heart smells like that stuff that comes out of a bottle that you put on really shy chicken to try and save it but it just makes it worse that's not bad no okay NOP never mind never mind oh I know Kendrick Lamar said turn this TV off but I'm put the put these chopsticks down that should be the name of the song I don't want to hold the bag up doesn't deserve that no you should see this you you should see this you need to see the sauce is bad enough but the chicken has a terrible metallic off flavor to it that this happens a lot with frozen chicken and I've had frozen chicken today that does not have that flavor the reason for this is probably because Trader Joe's is a private label company they work directly with manufacturers to create all the Trader Joe's line of products and often they're sourcing from entirely different people entirely different countries entirely different everything so this presumably is not prepared harvested or or or anything the same way as the other chicken that I've had today so you're going to have varying results with a private label company so far most of the stuff has been great today this has got to be the worst I'm giving this just cuz the chicken's not like dry it's got a good texture and the sauce tastes better than I thought the chicken itself is so have one more just make sure I didn't have a bad piece or something no there it is it hits late it comes late but it comes it's coming for you unless you don't buy it so don't because it's a two two okay kimbop I like kimbop sure it looks like it Kims but will it bop Korean tofu and vegetable seaweed rice roll straight up microwaved okay let's see what the doctor has to say about this I'm the doctor last time that's very hot oh  it's good the worst thing about it is the seaweed really it's it's really chewy this is to be expected I mean the you're hardly going to be able to get a great result also don't I don't like how it's like it's tightened like a like a like a like a belt around the rolls and it's created that sort of divot you see that divot I don't like that but I accept it still this is goodish trying to imagine dipping it in some soy sauce it I mean you know definitely be better with soy I have I don't know why I'm not doing it it's cuz I don't want to eat another one I'm starting to get very full it is a pale limitation of fresh kimbop but the fact that this was frozen is very impressive the sushi rice uh is has a solid texture to it um the seaweeds regrettable The Filling is good it's it this is this is an achievement

r about 15 minutes we just want the onions to soften up as well as give up a bit of their moisture but we don't want anything turning brown just yet once about 15 minutes have passed and the onions are nice and soft we're going to remove the cover increase the heat to medium and cook stirring frequently for anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour add a splash of water and scrape the bottom of the pan as many times as you like until you have some deeply golden brown Jammy onions this stuff is completely delicious and very naturally sweet so I'm very curious to see what kind of ice cream it's going to make the next thing I'm curious about tomato based ice cream which is going to be our standin for ketchup I'm going to start by making a tomato jam I'm cutting little crosses into the bottoms of 1 kg of fresh ripe Tomatoes which we're then going to blanch and peel in other words we're dropping the tomatoes one or two at a time into a pot of boiling water for about 1 minute or until you start to see the skin split along the sides we're then fishing them out and dumping them directly into an ice water bath this is called shocking the tomatoes and it's going to both halt the cooking process and make the tomatoes easier to peel which once everybody's blanched and sh we're going to start doing we're going to gently peel the skins off each tomato then cut the tomatoes into quarters cut out their cores and then cut each quarter into one in pieces once your tomatoes are broken down it's time to scoop them directly into your lap this is going to make for an efficient I'm just kidding there's a sauce bin down there into a medium sauce span goes our Tomatoes along with about 450 G of granulated sugar and the juice of half a lemon we're then going to bring this to a simmer over medium heat reduce the heat to medium low and continue to simmer for about an hour stirring frequently and occasionally skimming off the orange foam that appears on top by the end the mixture should have reduced by about half now to represent the peanut plant I want something earthy something grassy and something peanuty so I'm going to make a beetroot matcha and peanut ice cream now for all of our ice cream flavors we're going to need a basic custard same as the one we made for Mochi ice cream last week four cups of heavy cream 2 cups of milk one cup of sugar and a pinch of kosher salt brought to a bare simmer over medium heat then we're bringing this mixture over to eight separated egg yolks that we have set in a large heatproof bowl then we're going to very very slowly Ladle the mixture into the eggs while whisking constantly this is going to temper the eggs which is going to prevent them from scrambling in our ice cream and this ice cream's going to be weird enough without scrambled eggs in it once we've added about a third of the heavy cream and milk mixture we're adding everything back to the pot and whisking constantly over medium heat until it reaches 175° F and becomes thick enough to coat the back of a spoon now into some various containers I have our different flavorings tomato jam on the far left followed by caramelized onion next some beetroot puree and last some creamy peanut butter about a half a cup of each we are then tiny whisking each of these until they are completely homogeneous and if you're wondering what the matcha ice cream is I have some leftover from last week that I'll be repurposing because fun fact you can melt and reurn ice cream well maybe that's just a fact I don't know about a fun fact either way every custard is getting covered and fridged overnight before being churned via your method of choice there's our beetroot ice cream some matcha ice cream some peanut butter ice cream for peanuts flavor caramelized onion ice cream and tomato jam ice cream Each of which should be churned until it has the texture of soft serve at which point we're going to scrape it back into a clean container smooth it out and let it camp out in the freezer again overnight then about a half an hour before serving we're going to transfer everybody over to the fridge so they can soften up a little bit for easy scooping so here we go one heaping scoop each of caramelized onion tomato jam and then to stand in for the peanut plant you'll see that I did a kind of Neapolitan of beetroots matcha and peanut butter is it the prettiest thing in the world no but neither am I and I'm okay with me but is that all about to change as I dig into this insane mish mash of savory sweet ice creams let's find out the caramelized onion was interesting the tomato jam was interesting and the beetroot matcha peanut butter was interesting that's about the only thing I can say they're inoffensive but I wouldn't go so far as to call them good I think what this thing needs is a little bit of the old-fashioned Sunday treatment whipped cream chocolate sauce and a cherry now that is a day let's take a big old bite and that is when I learned that chocolate and onions don't mix any patties available in six designer [Music] colors Mr Squidward come look don't that look appetizing good sir wait give me an orange Patty with extra purple hey what's up guys welcome back to binging with babish where this week we're finally taking a look at pretty patties now the late great Steven hillenberg creator of SpongeBob specified that crappy patties are meatless so as you can see I have the entire vegetable Kingdom strewn before me but before we can make any pastel patties we have to make some brilliant buns now my first instinct was to recreate the brightly colored barely Browning bread from The Brood Witch episode now not only did the egg wash used to adhere the sesame seeds to the bun caused the bun to Brown but late that night I awoke in a cold sweat remembering that eggs are not vegan and on the off chance that's what he meant I decided to start over with a lean burger bundo we're starting with 510 G of bread flour in a large bowl to which we're going to add 10 G of instant yeast 30 g of sugar and 2 taspo of kosher salt that we're going to regular size whisk together to make sure that everything is evenly distributed throughout the flour before adding 275 mil of water and 60 mil of neutral flavored oil like vegetable or Canola mixing together at first by spatula and then by hand until combined into a Shaggy yet homogeneous dough normally we would now want to knead this within an inch of its life until it passes the window pane test but since we have to make six different colors and I don't want to make six different batches of dough I weighing and dividing this dough into six equal pieces working with one at a time and keeping the rest covered first I'm going to break it in half placeing the jar of a food processor ready the food coloring of my choice and then with the food processor running slowly drizzling a small amount of color down through the feed tube then letting the dough process for about 45 seconds total both evenly Distributing the color throughout the dough and helping to develop gluten use the dough as a sort of sponge to pick up all the scraps give it a sort of gestural kneading and place it in a covered oil bowl until nearly doubled in size then we're going to rinse and repeat with the remaining Doe's orange red indigo violet and good oldfashioned green once everybody is well kneaded and tinted it's time to let them rise cover everybody with plastic wrap and allow to bulk ferment at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours until visibly iged by anywhere from 50 to 100% next up shaping go ahead and dig out the first color of your choice I'm going with orange weigh it and divide that that number precisely in half because each of these mini batches is going to yield two extra- large slider buns which I realize is an oxymoron go ahead and roll each portion into a nice smooth taut ball lightly pressing down each to make sure that they don't end up too vertical and arranging with plenty of space on a parchment line baking sheet before covering with oil plastic wrap once again leaving it to its own devices for 1 to 2 hours until nearly doubl in size then comes the sticky issue of sesame seed adhesion I'm going with a water wash to keep things vegan and to prevent Browning but that's going to have all the sticking power of well water so they're probably going to have all the staying power of my hairline either way these guys are headed into a preheated 350° fhe oven for 15 to 18 minutes until nicely puffed and set and registering between 195 to 205° F at their thickest Point allow to cool completely on the trays if they're on the lower end of that Spectrum now onto the issue of vegan cheese style products once again I'm only making one of each of these Burgers so I don't want to make a huge amount of each different color of cheese so I'm lining these muffin tins with oiled plastic wrap and using them as a mold for each color for the cheese itself into the bowl of a blender goes 200 g of rinsed cashews 200 g of refined coconut oil 2 tbsp plus 1 taspo of Kappa Carin 25 G of Arrow root powder 2 TPO of kosher salt 1 and 1/2 tpoon of onion powder 1 tpoon garlic powder 25 G of nutritional yeast 15 mil of lemon juice 100 Mil of sauerkraut or pickled Brine and 375 mil of cold water the stuff's all getting blended together into rather a thick pasty paste for which you're probably going to need to enlist the help of your favorite for blender stuffer pureeing for at least 60 seconds on high speed with varying levels of difficulty until completely smooth next up you're going to gently Heat this on the stove top until it reaches 180° F I can't seem to find footage of this maybe I didn't hit record but here's the stuff after it's been cooked which I'm now Distributing into each muffin cavity where I'm going to proceed to tint it using a little bit of food coloring and a tiny whisk this should hopefully yield six pucks of sliceable meltable colorful vegan cheese alls it needs is to be covered and refrigerated at least 4 hours or up to overnight to set up the Capa Carin and hopefully giving it a bouncy cheese-like texture now upon extraction I discovered the tiny whisk betrayed me and the cheese color was not as consistent as I had hoped but it was delightfully sliceable kept its shape and was actually very cheesy it definitely tasted funkier and cheesier than American cheese does even though that's obviously not saying much if you're going to make this yourself with food coloring for some reason maybe just add the food coloring before putting it in the mold now onto the Patty part of the pretty Patty obviously there's a wealth of colors in nature that we can put to good use but how do we turn them into veggie patties so as you can see for that I am preparing a Litany of legumes cooking these three different colors of lentils to their various states of dness draining a whole bunch of different colored beans and peeling some purple potatoes normally I would just cover these with cold water and cook them like it was any other day but we want to make these things as purple as possible so we're going to cover them with cold water and cook them like it's any other day but during their last 3 minutes of cooking I'm going to add some thinly sliced purple cabbage making sure that it's fully submerged before adding a teaspoon of baking powder which uses science or magic or both to turn the cabbage and the cooking water a brilliant shade of blue definitely not totally necessary but I wanted to try it out and this seemed as applicable an application as I could apply it to go ahead and spread this out in a rim baking sheet so that it can cool entirely before being fashioned into a burger also corn just corn now it's finally time to start prettying patties Patty equation we decided to work with was one part cooked vegetable in this case spinach one part legumes I'm using half green lentils half edamame half a part the grain of your choice I'm using using brown rice 1/4 part breadcrumbs or ground oats for a binder 1 tbsp vital wheat gluten and salt and pepper to taste pulse until a ground beef like consistency is achieved thickening with more rice ground oats or vital wheat gluten as needed and there you have it our green Patty don't have super high hopes for this one let's try yellow I'm starting with yellow lentils the aforementioned corn ground oats and brown rice more excited about this one because it's basically just a fried corn cake then for orange I'm going grated carrot for the vegetable brown rice for the Grain and vital wheat gluten for the binder medium hopes this one I love carrots but I've never described them as burger like next up for red I'm going kidney beans for the legume what I know are going to be divisive sundried tomatoes for the vegetable brown rice for the Grain and ground oats for the binder pulse until pebbly and let's be honest not red enough so this is going to be the one patty where I cheat with a little bit of food color so let's all just collectively pretend that we didn't see that and then for purple as you might have guessed I'm going with peeled and grated beets this long with some neutrally colored pinto beans produced a picture perfect purple Patty next up our blue potatoes and cabbage are going to beom comped by blue corn tortilla chips brown rice and vital wheat gluten for a Patty that I'm pretty sure it's going to taste awesome I mean it's mostly potatoes and chips so there you have it six different veggie burger bases Each of which I'm going to press into 2 oz patties the same width as our buns the last bit of prep that now remains is the slicing of the vegan cheese and given that the stuff has the consistency of Play-Doh it might be more about shaping than slicing once you got your cheese arts and crafts ready to go we can start slicing our buns I wanted to make consistent even cuts and as it turned out a coaster from today's sponsor was the perfect pedestal upon which to prop our benen benen of course being French for um bread first things first once our buns are sliced we got to toast them I don't care what your Burger's made of I Don't Care What You're Made Of you deserve a Toasted Bun once everybody is varying degrees of visibly golden brown we're going to make sure that our pan is nice and hot and well oiled considering that Our Patties have little to no fat of their own as you can see each Patty Browns at a different rate so be sure to keep a close eye on crusts especially if you're making six different kinds of veggie burgers at a time also use caution when flipping with all that excess oil in the Pan Once everybody's fried up it's time to color coordinate and serve each Patty bun and cheese getting carefully color matched before being placed on a large balsawood artist pallette in the same color order and orientation as presented by Spongebob on the show and there you have it folks pretty patties lots of stuff to unpack here so let's go one at a time I'm scared of losing even more sesame seeds but we must take a look at these cross-sections first up the green pretty Patty and while this particular veggie burger was decidedly veggie oriented in its flavors it had a nice little crisp to it and played really well with the vegan cheese next up the Orange Patty look at that cheese sort of kind of melt and this one was good it didn't really taste like carrots but not much like anything else either next up the purple violet or mauve Patty which mostly just tasted like beets which means I'm not going to eat it unless there's goat cheese next up the yellow corn Patty which to my disappointment only barely tasted like corn next up the Indigo or midnight blue Patty this is one I'm most excited about and it's pretty good but it really does just taste like a tortilla chip Burger last up the red Patty made from sundried tomatoes and beans now this one at least kind of looks like cartoon meat but it doesn't taste as much like sundried tomatoes as I had hoped so let's rank them first up purple beets not so great next up yellow corn about as Bland a burger as ever there was almost the same story for the orange carrot burger then the Red sundried Tomato Burger a little bit more flavor but still kind of disappointing then the blue Burger which was good but maybe a little morally questionable and then believe it or not I think the green was my favorite it's a veggie burger that's not pretending to be anything other than just that a veggie burger but I think we can agree there's one thing that all these patties have in common they are indeed pretty what's that candy machine M help nougat [Music] [Applause] crunch I'll only be gone a second hey hey what's up guys welcome back to binging with babish where this week we're taking a look at the kelp nuket crunch from SpongeBob a candy bar I've been dreaming about since childhood that contains only three known ingred ingredients kelp nougat and crunch here before me I have some sheets of toasted NY I don't know if this is technically kelp or not but it's going to bring some great Oceanic flavors to our candy bar not something I ever thought I would actively seek out but here we are now for the crunch I'm going to make a layer of good oldfashioned Rice Krispy treat I'm starting by generously lubricating a quarter sheet with non-stick spray and lining it with parchment paper molten Rice Krispy treat is about the stickiest substance known to man so the more non-stick precautions taken the better over on the stove top in a high walled sauté we're going to melt and cook 20 G of unsalted butter for 4 to 5 minutes over medium heat until it begins to lightly brown that's right we're making brown butter Rice Krispy Treats next up we're adding 100 G of miniature marshmallows stirring and cooking those for about a minute until they're fully melted add 50 g of puffed rice brand cereal stir until homogeneously gooey kill the heat add a little bit of salt make sure that everybody has gotten to know everybody and then dump it out into your prepared pan then you got about 2 minutes before the sky starts to harden so while everything's warm and malleable try to get everything as flat as possible like I always say an uneven candy bar is made by an uneven mind now we're going to let this cool completely while we make an even stickier substance homemade nougat in a small bowl I'm combining 35 G of molted milk powder 40 G of powdered sugar and 9 G of sifted wakame powder this is our actual kelp that's going in the candy bar go ahead and Tiny whis that together until no clumps remain let's give this little taste out of curiosity and it's good it's weird but it's good just like yours truly now nougat is basically basically a Hot Sugar mering so down your safety glasses and in the bowl of a stand mixer combine two large egg whites with 50 g of glucose syrup meanwhile over on the stove top we're combining 475 G of granulated sugar 550 more G of glucose syrup and 150 g of water we're going to bring this to a simmer and continue cooking over medium low heat until it reaches 250° F by which time we'll hopefully have completed our unfinished business over in the stand mixer which is to whip the egg whites and glucose syrup two stiff peaks before slowly and carefully drizzling in the boiling sugar mixture trying not to hit the sides of the bulb trying not to hit the wire whisk either then once all the Sugar's been added we're letting the sky whip on high speed for eight full minutes during which time it should become smooth and glossy at this point we're going to add a teaspoon and a half of vanilla paste and working quickly so that the nougat does not drop below 140° F fold in our kelp and molted milk powder mixture and there you have it folks kelp nougat I don't recommend tasting this until it's cooled completely if you at all value your mouth skin but I'm happy to report rep that this has graduated from pretty good to surprisingly good so we're going to scoop it out onto our awaiting Rice Krispy treat and once again try to press and spread it out into an even layer while it's still warm you're going to want to keep whatever tool you're using lubed up with non-stick spray preferably sprayed at you by a friend but eventually you're going to give up on that when you realize you could just use another sheet pan to press it out flat and even just make sure that it's appropriately oiled press it down with all of your upper body strength and pull it off to reveal that it didn't really make a difference and if anything made things slightly worse so just press it out as even ly as you can and remind yourself that it's not your job to change people's perception of how well you make candy oh yeah we're also going to put down a couple of those sheets of NY likewise while the guy is nice and warm otherwise it will not stick now once cooled sometimes nougat can turn out a little brittle so we got to slice it into clean even bars while it's still a little warm go ahead and turn it out onto a lightly oiled countertop admire the effectiveness of your non-stick precautions now I'm going to start by trimming off the edges not only to make snacks but so our bars have clean even uh edges then we want to cut this down into individual bars now the bars on the show looked like a short Stout rectangle so I'm going to make these a little inappropriately large and despite having a ruler right there I'm not going to use it and end up with uneven bars might as well eat my mistakes right but as it turns out too soon the nougat hasn't set yet needs to sit overnight before its final texture is achieved before that happens I'm going to enrod these in white chocolate I did not temper this chocolate properly so I'm just hoping that it's going to set at room temperature and about halfway through the process I had the bright idea to make these guys green on account of them being kelp candy bars and what have you so once the chocolate has miraculously set we are left with the final product the kelp nougat crunch let's take a look at that cross-section beautiful looks like a candy bar but has a taste and I'm happy to report it actually tastes really good I'm sorry you probably didn't understand that it tastes really good could we interest you in some chocolate chocolate did you say chocolate yes sir with or without nuts chocolate chocolate chocolate [Applause] chocolate hey what's up guys welcome back to binging with babish where last week we hit 10 million subscribers so on Monday we tried to come up with the craziest way we could imagine to celebrate and I knew immediately we had to take a crack at chocolate from SpongeBob and oh how do you like that there's some chocolate right here never mind easiest episode ever anyway thank you guys for subscribing and I hope you have a great day and obviously I'm just joking of course we are going to make some chocolate entirely from scratch which is going to require some tools and ingredients that you can't really get at your local grocery so if you guys will follow me on a quick field trip we'll run out and get the stuff that we need to make our own chocolate which might take us a bit farther a field than usual [Music] [Laughter] chocolate chocolate chocolate [Music] all right that was dramatic but we dragged the fancy camera all the way here and by God we're going to use it we've got one day in Ecuador and we're spending it here at hasienda cacao mango a cow Farm nestled in the mountains about an hour away from the city of Guayaquil our guide Hamil who's also an owner provided us with a tour of the farm and showed me how Cacao is grown and harvested there the cacao fruit grows from these little flowers on the trees and the 0 1% of them that get pollinated grow to this size in about 4 months the ripeness of the fruit is judged by its color which Hamil explained and then let me try harvesting one for myself as you can see there is just purple caca but we need find uh red cacao right now red so when the caca is Rip it's ready for collect or harvest so if you see a red caca please tell me great say you can do it huh do it and twist in One Direction okay oh he's a Twist he's a twisty one great all right uh hit the the pot in this part just not too hard not too light just okay just one two three uh y ready yep done here we go it oh man fresh cacao H the fresh cacao the idea to try is just put in your mouth don't bite it don't bite it just put on your mouth sock it and don't bite when you finish spit it out oh it's delicious it's awesome yeah oh man it's delicious here you got to try this open live once I got my fill of fresh cacao fruit it was time to check out the next stage the chocolate making process fermentation which we skipped over because Hil didn't have any fermenting at the time get some stock I mean uh we're going to go see the fermentors after 6 to 10 days the beans turn a reddish brown and then are dried after which they're ready to be turned into chocolate this is what I'll be using to make modern chocolate at home but Hamil wanted to show me the traditional way that chocolate was prepared the fermented beans are roasted in a clay pot for a few minutes until you hear popcorn sounds which is the sound of the husks cracking indicating that they ready to peel the the idea in the roasted process is try to peel the Shell with the peels removed we then run the beans through a manual grinder and shake the ground beans lovingly then we're back on the stove where we warm some water to which we're going to add our 100% cacao raw sugar cane some chili pepper lemongrass and clove Leaf once everything is brought to a simmer it's ready to enjoy ah perfect but now it's time to head back to New York and make our bar of chocolate so we thanked our gracious hosts and we're on our way with fresh cacao fruit in tow only did leave it at the hotel after realizing we wouldn't make it through customs so I'm going to use these backup beans that I bought online they might not be exactly the same but for all intents and purposes they're right where we left off at the farm so we're going to start by roasting these guys spreading them out evenly in a single layer on Two Rim baking sheets roasting in a 250° F oven for 25 to 45 minutes shaking and rotating halfway through shorter roasting times will apparently yield a fruer chocolate and longer roasting times yielding a nuttier chocolate so we went for about 30 minutes to strike a good balance between fruity and nutty let these guys cool completely and then it's time to peel in a process known as winnowing now not all cacao beans are as easy to peel as the ones we saw out in Ecuador the shells were holding on for deer life and the beans were a little bit more brittle so before I could get the skins off they were breaking down into nibs which I then had to separate by hand So eventually I turned as I so often do to a hammer resigning myself to hand sorting through a kilo of nibs and shells which I was determined to do for about 5 minutes luckily we came across a technique that involves making wind in the kitchen starting off by thoroughly smashing up a handful of beans making sure that no shells were sticking to their nib counterparts and then slowly carefully sprinkling them down in front of a running fan thanks to the husk lighter weight and less aerodynamic form factor should get pushed out of the nib stream as they Cascade down into a bowl now this is obviously not a perfect system it makes a Dusty husky mess of anything that's in front of the fan and definitely does not catch all the Skins requiring at least a dozen passes to get rid of what looked like about 90% of the husks the cool part is that it was surprisingly effective at not sacrificing nibs as the pile accumulating to the left of the fan contained virtually only husks that being said some manual removal was definitely necessary which Kendall and N were very kind to help me with otherwise it would have taken me much longer than an hour and a half to sort through this kilo of nibs but there you have it the building blocks of chocolate which must now be crushed into a liquid called chocolate liquor no not chocolate lure which is alcoholic while chocolate liquor is an ultra smooth paste of cocoa solids and cocoa butter before we break out the heavy stuff we're going to preemptively process the nibs in batches for about 1 minute each until they're just starting to release their fats and take on a consistency like wet sand rinse and repeat with the remaining nibs and then it's time to bust out the conture this home appliance version of the traditional process where two rough Stone wheels are kept in Mobile in the center of a rotating drum the bottom of which is made from the same Stone this has the effect of both grinding and warming the chocolate deepening the flavors and making it impossibly smooth we're going to start by gently warming the drum of the Contra itself using a torch on a very low setting and a laser thermometer then we're going to add the pre-ground nibs and set this thing to maximum grind which is its only setting just like me oh wait no that didn't work both the joke and the conture which due to the still rough texture of the chocolate obstinately refus to turn just like me that worked even less now you're supposed to let this grind for an hour on its own before adding any cocoa butter but we decided to cheat hoping that the fat would help get things going and it did adding the chocolate and cocoa butter in small batches the Contour finally wored to life now for a 65% dark chocolate that meant obviously 65% cacao at 750 G 5% cocoa butter 55 G and the rest is sugar which will add after these guys get to know each other for about 4 hours now I can't recommend what I'm doing for safety and legal reasons but we're taping down the 45 minutes maximum timer on this conure and leaving this device to its own devices for 4 hours before adding any sugar now I had never used one of these things before so I was surprised to find that after the allotted time it had rendered our cocoa solids and fats into an incredibly smooth liquid it already looked and tasted like 100% baking chocolate but we want to eat this stuff so we got to add sugar 30% of the total weight is about 350 G of super fine sugar added slowly through the sugar feed hole thing now the chocolate's texture might have seemed very nearly done but this thing was only getting started gearing up to grind for another 20 hours apparently this not only makes the chocolate super smooth but develops its flavor the next morning and it's not quite done yet but I want to come downstairs and give it a taste and at this point it is untempered chocolate which is kind of magic to see happen from its original Bean state but how's it taste and the answer is and I might be biased here really really good it's rich and deep and not too sweet and pronouncedly fruity later on I'm all dressed for work and the chocolate has passed the 20h hour mark and at this point it's clocking about 110° fhe a perfect place to start the tempering process now we want to slowly cool it off two ways first by pouring it into a large stainless steel bowl where we can agitate and aate it with great figure and this might seem like cheating but we need some seed chocolate that is a handful of chocolate that's already been tempered so that it contains the precious crystals necessary to make our chocolate set shiny and snappy at room temperature so after adding 10 to 20% of the chocolate's weight and Seed chocolate we're stirring the chocolate constantly and spiritedly especially once the chocolate starts dropping below 94 de f as this is where crystals begin to grow if your seed chocolate isn't fully melted you can place it over a pot of simmering water but just make sure not to let it exceed 94 this is a pretty long and uous process so it's a good idea every once in a while to do a tempered test coating the end of a butter knife or tiny offset spatula with a thin layer of chocolate every 5 minutes letting it sit at room temperature for another 5 minutes to see how your crystals are developing you can see the Improvement in The Temper from left to right that resulted from nothing more than time and agitation at long last once the chocolate is tempered it's finally time time to turn it into chocolate bars spreading the chocolate evenly over a polycarbonate chocolate bar mold scraping off the excess back into the bowl to flatten out the top don't worry we obviously saved all the extra and I plan on eating all of it over the next 7 days at most and then to coax out any hidden bubbles underneath the surface of the chocolate we're going to whack it many many times as hard ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
s we can without breaking the mold against the tabletop before stepping aside and letting the crystals do their thing for at least 2 hours and optionally this is the point where you can add stuff like salt after all nowadays you can buy almost any dessert with extra salt sprinkled on it 4 hours later just to be safe I'm finally going to unmold my bars looks like our temper was effective and the chocolate bars have set so time to turn them mat onto a sheet ban and take a look and unfortunately it looks like a little bit of moisture got into the mold before we poured in the chocolate resulting in a slight Bloom on its surface but this is easily remedied by very carefully painting the chocolate with a torch if you heat it above 94° it will go out of temper so be very super careful and there you have it chocolate from scratch it might not be totally Bean de bar but it's as close as we could legally get all that's left now is some arts and crafts to make it look like the bars from SpongeBob I'm starting with gold foil wrapped around the chocolate itself blue foil round that red foil stripe on top of that yada yada yada I got to play with a glue stick for the first time in a while and while it might only be a cartoonish approximation of a cartoon there you have it chocolate from SpongeBob look it even matches the reference photo on Kendall's laptop now I just got to make the same face there it is and as we all know no self-respecting candy bar salesman would be caught dead without one of these what is it it's a candy bar bag you knucklehead so when you're carrying your candy bars from oh wait a second hold on I forgot about the candy bar bag bag in here we should have oh um there we go there's there's the good stuff thank you guys so much for helping the BCU reach 10 million subscribers you know it's not as easy as it looks sometimes I got to move the antenna sometimes I lose the remote and sometimes my butt itch is real bad oh you poor poor thing by the way you forgot your [Music] face so this is the thanks I get for working over time over time hey what's up guys welcome back to binging with babish where this week we're taking a look at Patrick's dessert briefcase from SpongeBob SquarePants for which as you can see I've procured a very inexpensive briefcase which I'm going to mod out using hot glue and leather straps to accomodate our overtime lunch for which we're going to need a whole lot of donuts and since we want lots of variety I think cake Donuts are our best bet for a basic vanilla doughnut we're starting off by combining 240 G of allpurpose flour with 200 g of granulated sugar 100 G of brown sugar a teaspoon and2 baking powder and/ teaspoon baking soda whisk together the dry and so to the wet 180 mil of whole milk 75 of vegetable oil 1 tbspoon of vanilla paste and two large eggs cracked and broken in there however you like as long as you don't get any shell in there it's no big deal it's not like you're hosting a cooking show whisk the wet stuff until homogeneous and then add to the dry stuff standard cake batter procedure gently fold together until no dry clumps remain and mostly homogeneous not completely smooth but pretty much there this batter is going to thicken as we allow the flour to hydrate over the next 10 minutes which it's going to do in a pastry bag or zip toop plastic bag with the corner cut off for piping we are thoroughly greasing the cavities of our doughnut pans then we're going to fill our cavities about halfway with doughnut batter that's way too much there we go that's better once filled about halfway these guys are headed for a preheated 350° F oven for 10 to 12 minutes until they emerge golden brown and 200 to 210° f F at their thickest point a let to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before twisting out onto a cooling rack now converting this recipe to chocolate duts is super easy just like our chocolate cookies we're simply swapping out an amount of flour in this case 65 G for cocoa powder and that's it that's all you really need to do the baking procedure is very much the same but since they're chocolate they're a little bit harder to tell when they're done so I'm making sure that none of my doughnut cavities are filled any more than halfway and baking for at least 12 minutes or until we get a good temp at their thickest point now the only other modifier that I'm going to do to the actual ual doughnut batter is to make a maple dut achieve simply by replacing our granulated sugar with 3/4 of a cup or 175 mil of maple syrup and reducing the amount of milk by 75 ml to account for the extra moisture add the maple syrup to the wet stuff instead of the dry and you got yourself the maple of Maple Donuts my personal favorite now to introduce some variations on the theme I'm making more vanilla donuts and subdividing the batter down into three parts Each of which I'm going to flavor differently first up a tablespoon of poppy seeds and 1/ teaspoon of lemon oil next simply add rainbow sprinkles and you got yourself some instant birthday cake batter lastly a tablespoon of matcha which I would recommend you replace flour with in the original recipe cuz this made it a little too thick but still works pipe and bake as usual and we got ourselves some fun spins on the original formula Each of which we can whimsically Frost accordingly now it's leftover Maple batter I'm going to add some frozen blueberries for some very obviously awesome Maple blueberry Donuts imagine making a breakfast sandwich out of that and for variations on the chocolate going super simple starting with some raspberry extract for a chocolate raspberry doughnut a tablespoon of espresso powder for chocolate coffee doughnut and a splash of grand marer for a chocolate orange doughnut then once all the doughnuts are completely cool it's time to glaze them Each of which we're going to make by combining about a cup of powdered sugar with a small amount of flavorful liquid like maple syrup skim milk blueberry juice cooled coffee whatever is relevant to the individual doughnut so there's our dozen lovely doughnuts which we can now arrange in our briefcase for Easy Transport to and from work but there's something missing or rather two things first up a banana split I'm going to show you guys a little trick they taught me when I worked at the chocolate room in Brooklyn where for our banana split we would obviously split a banana sprinkle the banana with sugar and then torch it for an instant banana Brule or banana split Foster or whatever it is you want to call it just make sure it cools completely before peeling and serving on the left I have a simple vanilla milkshake with whipped cream and on the right I'm assembling our banana split with three scoops of vanilla ice cream or the ice cream of your choice flanked by Arana brulee topped with whipped cream then drizzled with chocolate sauce that I was too lazy to make and finished with three bright red Marino cherries and there you have it folks Patrick's dessert free case A Little More arts and crafts than usual but I think you'll agree pretty worth it at least just to see it in real life I wouldn't say it's the most practical working lunch but everybody at the office seem to like it perfect entry and toasted alond that's unexpected he stuck it and just look at that even coding curse him that's good but perhaps a bit too highbrow for this crowd now get up there and show him how the Common Man prepares his frozen dairy [Music] treats just just look at that concentration oh a little shaky on that entry but just look at that form hey what's up guys welcome back to binging with babish where this week with the Olympics in full swing it felt like high time to tackle SpongeBob and Patrick's ice cream entrance into the fry cook games first up the raining champ SpongeBob for which we have to make a yellow Sponge Bob so I'm greasing and parchment papering a 9x13 baking pan and beginning to separate the yolks and whites of three large room temperature eggs first the yolks are going in the bowl of a stand mixer along with 75 G of granulated sugar these are getting whipped together on high speed for 3 to 4 minutes until pale and thickened in very nearly at the ribbon stage in other words you should be able to draw a figure of eight that keeps its shape scoop that aside thoroughly clean the bowl and then its egg white time which we're going to beat together with an eighth of a teaspoon of cream of tartar anytime you're beating egg whites to any stage this helps keep them stable once the whites are frothy we're going to slowly stream in 100 G of granulated sugar once all the sugar is added we're continuing to beat for anywhere from 1 to 3 minutes until the resulting merang reaches the soft Peak stage in other words when you pull the Whisk out it showed look like this next up we're negotiating the dries combining 150 g of sifted cake flour with 3/4 of a teaspoon kosher salt and 1 teaspoon of baking powder tiny whisking to combined then we're combining 60 G of room temperature milk with 50 g of melted unsalted butter 1 teaspoon vanilla paste and 1 tpoon of banana extract and to get this sponge cake SpongeBob yellow I'm adding a few teaspoons of yellow food coloring tining with to combine and then in a large bowl we're combining the egg yolk mixture the dry mixture and the milk mixture gently folding to combine just until no dry patches remain then we're going to add the beaten egg whites in two stages start by adding about a third of it which we're going to gently fold in it's going to lose most of its volume but it's going to help the remaining egg whites mix in more easily so once you got no more remaining white streaks add the remaining egg whites and very gently fold together resulting in a light fluffy silky batter which we're going to pour into our prepared pan gently coax into the corners until even and then it's headed into a preheated 350° fhe oven for 10 to 14 minutes while this cools it's time to make our ice cream out of none other than SpongeBob's Hearth and Home I'm peeling and Coring a pineapple and placing 350 G worth in this mysterious cup along with 90 G of whole milk 50 g of heavy cream half teaspoon vanilla extract half teaspoon kosher salt and 100 G of agave syrup or the same amount by weight of your sweetener of choice tiny wh to combine and then we're pouring it directly over the pineapple then this guy is headed into the freezer overnight until Rock Solid now since SpongeBob's dive is the highbrow act I thought it warranted using a fancy new toy that ninja creamy that everybody on Tik Tok can't seeing to stop creaming stuff with as you can see our pineapple milk and sugar mixture is hard as rock into the high-speed death machine it goes select ice cream setting and in 4 minutes a rock hard block of fruit Dairy and sugar is shaved and Blended by a blade that moves up and down through the cup producing a silky smooth sorbet that has to be scooped to be believed apparently this is the home Cook's answer to the Paco jet made famous by the menu and for a giant pricey blender that doesn't do as much stuff as a blender I got to say pretty cool so now we have the core elements of our SpongeBob ice cream let's put them together first I'm carefully slicing the cooled cake into precise rectangles using rulers and maths trimming it down into little rectangles that are about a half an inch smaller than my intended mold and it has the added benefit of looking exactly like SpongeBob so now we have to Encon this banana flavored cake into pineapple sorbet so I'm spreading a little sorbet in the bottom plopping the cake in the center and packing more sorbet around and on top of it rinsing repeating for all the mold holes these guys are headed into the freezer overnight so they're completely solid before dipping once retrieve from the molds we have to double popsicle stick just like SpongeBob did back into the freezer for another hour or two to make sure that they're extra extra cold and then for dipping I've melted one pound of dark chocolate and mixed it with 3 tbsps of coconut oil for a homemade Magic Shell in goes my roughest looking ice cream bar for practice which I'm glad that I did because the shell hardened way faster than I thought it would so when I dipped it in my toast chopped almonds I did not get even coverage worthy of the fried cook games so for once taking an actual cooking tip from a cartoon I dove quickly from the chocolate immediately into the almonds resulting in much nicer more even coverage so there's our high concept High futin SpongeBob ice cream what about the Everyman Patrick ice cream well first off it felt like it'd be crazy not to use starfruit granted the only starf fruit I could find is under ripe which apparently causes indigestion so I'm not going to use too much of it I'm roughly chopping three fruits placing them in the jar of a food processor and processing until thoroughly process processed we're just going to be straining out the juice so you can break this down into a pretty fine paste now for the pink element strawberry starfruit has a nice ring to it so I'm going to puree a pint of strawberries and combine them with 100 G of star fruit juice then to this mixture I'm adding 340 G each heavy cream and whole milk and of course a whopping 200 g of granulated sugar I'm also going to add a little bit of pink a little bit of red food coloring to amp up the Patrick nness so if the ninja creamy is high brow how does the Common Man prepare his frozen dairy treats well one way that requ Ires no special equipment is the Ice Bowl method place your ice cream base in a bowl set in a larger bowl full of ice and whisk constantly for 10 minutes you can also add water and salt to the ice to better translate the cold cover the bowl with a clean towel or plastic wrap and freeze for 30 minutes uncover and once again whisk constantly for 10 minutes cover it back up send it back into the freezer for 30 minutes and repeat this process two more times you know you're done when the ice cream base is thick and slushy and your arm doesn't want to do this no more pour into the ice cream container of your choice cover and freeze overnight and the next day all your effort will be rewarded with some pretty stiff icy ice cream this normally turns out smoother and softer with a more Dairy forward base but all the water and the strawberries and star fruit made it a little icy that being said it still Scoops and eats just fine I'm placing my prese scooped cones back in the freezer because they're going to have to be upside down for quite a bit I'm making a chocolate ganache by pouring 300 G of steaming heavy cream over 500 G of chopped chocolate then letting it sit for about 30 seconds before very gently stirring together but no matter how careful you are you can still split your ganache if it looks oily and kind of slides around the pan looks a little chunky you can fix this by heating it over a double boiler sometimes but it's easier to just add a little splash of Grandma's SquarePants cough medicine a touch of alcohol can help reims defy the mixture or it can make it worse I don't know ganache is kind of a mystery to me either way once you've got the fat and chocolate ratio right it's time to dip leave it upside down so it gets a little bit of a peak going pray that your pres scoop doesn't come plopping out into the chocolate and flip it over to try to get that Dairy Queen soft Peak not as photogenic as Patrick's but that didn't look fully real to me so there you have it SpongeBob and Patrick's ice creams from the fry cook games and since I'm too scared to even eat banana extract here's guest judge Kendall Beach she's not here to do the voiceover at the moment but I will relay her feedback she thought the pineapple ice cream was fantastic and the cake while nice and fluffy had a very strong fake banana flavor the Patric ice cream was too icy and the star fruit was too tarp so it's no contest SpongeBob wins this round the front cook games and in the end I had to try a little bit myself definitely omit the banana and maybe go with milk chocolate over dark but I think Patrick put it best when he said I got it let's get naked no Patrick let's save that for when we're selling real estate [Music],okay zero value to eating these on their own because with this sour cream and shive sauce this is really where the magic happens that's a good fried pickle it looks like she went nice and sparing with the sour cream sauce that's ideal you don't want this thing dripping in sour [Music] cream no notes this was young Bob that came up with this this was Baby Bob and he was innovative I don't think it was because his father wasn't supporting him okay sometimes you need to have boundaries to reach Beyond them you feel me cheese would certainly improve it but it doesn't really need it you've got the dairy you've got the the nice little sour hit from the from the the sour cream and from the piggles I think these are like Dill so they have a decent acidity level it's just every it's every bit as good as I imagine it if it had some kind of cheese on it no actually I think cheese would be too much I don't think there's any improving it I'm going to give this a nine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BzKBag59duU,[Music] here you go sir a KingSize Ultra Krabby Supreme with the works double batter fried on a stick thanks Barnacle head pardon me you forgot your mayonnaise thanks look at them eating that garbage it's disgusting hey what's up guys welcome back to binging with babish we're this week at your behest we're making a quadruple deluxe burger double batter fried with extra mayo and served on a stick so first things first we got to make some special sauce we're starting with equal parts mayo and ketchup maybe like a third of a cup of each and then ideally we want to add relish but I don't have any so I'm going to chop up a pickle very finely a nice Shake of paprika a little Shake of garlic powder a/4 of a small onion minced finely and 1 to 2 tbspoon of yellow mustard give it a mix with a spoon if you don't want to get your tiny whisk all clogged up taste for seasoning with a single finger tip cover and refrigerate until ready to use now we're on the burger patties themselves and whenever we're talking about fast food to me that means Smash Burgers so we're rolling all of our ground beef into 2 oz little meatballs seasoning with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper and introducing them to a wicked hot cast iron skillet Lube with vegetable oil and heat over medium high until wisps of smoke arise off the surface of the cooktop insert meatballs into the situation and squash flat with a stiff cold metal spatula with leverage assistance from a rolling pin squash them flat wait till they are deeply Brown on one side flip and cook for like 30 more seconds tops before topping with cheese stacking high and removing from the heat I know these burgers are a little small I meant for this to be a practice round but it came out so good I decided to roll with it and these are Deluxe Burgers which means lettuce tomato pickle onion and of course A Generous smear of our special sauce and based off its height alone I'm guessing that it was a quad Burger so we're stacking two more Patties on there at top a secondary bun loading up with all the requisite toppings and slathering our top bun with sauce and there you have it a serviceable fast food Burger that's relative ly healthy compared to the one that we're about to make for our deep frying batter we are combining half a cup of cornstarch half a cup of allpurpose flour a teaspoon of baking powder a teaspoon of kosher salt 3/4 of a cup of logger and 1/4 cup of vodka in a large bowl whisking gently to combine so as to not build up too much gluten in the batter and I forgot this is a krabby Supreme so why don't we Throw Some Bacon on there before we skewer the whole thing through with a bunch of skewers snip off the long ends and then we are heating 2 quarts of peanut oil to 375° f while that heats up it's time to batter our Burger words that I never thought that I would say the batter should have about the consistency of paint so feel free to add a little bit of beer if it's too thick but that's assuming that you'd actually recreate this which I really hope that you're not anyway we're deep frying the sky for 4 to 6 minutes until it's evenly golden brown and crisp removing to a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet and allowing to drip dry and cool off a little bit before removing the skewers painfully and then it's time to double batter our Burgers something I really never thought I'd say be careful as the only thing holding this thing together is a thin layer of tempura and then very carefully lower down into the preheated oil frying again for 4 to 6 minutes until evenly golden brown and crisp you know the drill use this time to contemplate what life decisions might have brought you to this point and then we're taking it out and placing it once again on a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet allowing to drip dry and cool off a bit before we prepare for consumption this gu's normally served on a stick and this is all I've got so I don't know there you go but I don't know about you guys I'm way more interested in the crosssection than I am eating this on a stick we haven't had a good cross-section in a while and this is a choice one It's oddly beautiful in a way but as usual it all comes down to taste and I'm really super embarrassed to say this was really good I mean it's a deep fried double battered quadruple cheese burger how bad could it be but oh my God I almost forgot the Mayo this is what makes the dish oh oh sorry you had to see that nobody's allowed to make a meme of that that's illegal don't you get it you crustaceous cheap skate I can't make a double Krabby Patty the work I can't put a Patty on a bun with lettuce cheese onions tomatoes ketchup mustard pickles and top bun together in that order it's time it is time as a thank you to everyone who helped make binging with babish my full-time job it's time to finally make the all-time most requested dish on this show the Krabby Patty the ingredients of which are laid here before you except of course the secret ingredient what is the secret ingredient well I just happen to have some right here that's right I finally cracked the code after a year of research I've come to the conclusion that the secret ingredient is a heaping tablespoon of nothing that might seem anticlimactic but it actually makes a lot of sense Mr Krabs is a shrewd businessman and it makes sense that rather than buying expensive secret ingredients he would create a burger that is its own gorilla marketing campaign that being said several sources cite the secret ingredient as being a pinch of King Neptune's Poseidon powder which I think is mono sodium glutamate or MSG so we're going to start by seasoning a store-bought Frozen beef patty with salt pepper and MSG now some people are saying that it's a crab Burger but Mr Krabs is a crab that's pretty horrible and barbaric even for Nickelodeon so once thought we're going to prepare our Burger much as we would any other Burger vegetable oil high heat cast iron then we're going to follow SpongeBob's exact order of assembly which starts with lettuce on top of the burger which is a terrible idea never do this I'm doing this for science then we're going single slice of yellow American single slice of videlia onion tomato ketchup mustard and the absolute most important part do not forget the pickles you don't want Bubble bass doing that God awul laugh of his top bun and there you have it a crabby patty with the works even kind of looks like that one in the training video right normal fast food Burger protocol would be to just dig in but I haven't been able to do a cross-section on this show in a while that's a big relief for me now as expected this was a totally delicious Burger MSG makes things taste better and while it's perfectly safe I understand if people have reservations about eating it now if you want to up the natural Umami content of your burger here's a few ways to do it the first stop is to make a seasoning out of some natural Umami bombs we're going to start with a bit of Bonito flake which is a shaved dried fish some dried shitake mushrooms some dried KOMU which is a sort of sea kelp so this seems even more accurate if I had to really realistically guess what Mr Krab's secret ingredient was it be that and a single anchovy now this is all sounding pretty fishy sorry but rest assured that these will not make your burger taste like seafood we're going to grind these into a fine d and all we're going to get from them flavor-wise is their glutamate content use a spice Grinder like this one to completely powderize these ingredients so they make an easy sprinkling dust for later on now on to the burger patty Umami refers to the unctuousness and savoriness of a dish so it only makes sense that we'd use some fatty flavorful cuts of beef so we're going to cut equal parts beef short rib and chuck steak into 1in cubes that we're going to place in the freezer for about 15 minutes along with the blade of a food processor to get everything nice and firm and cold pulse in your food processor until you achieve a nice pebbly ground beef make sure not to overprocess your beef or you're going to end up with soft balls instead of burgers back on Umami Duty it's time to address Tomatoes we're going to oven dry our tomatoes in a low oven on a non-stick surface like a s Pat drizzle with a little bit of olive oil sprinkle with a little bit of kosher salt and place in a 200° F oven for about an hour and a half or until they come out wrinkly a little prunes like these guys next to up the glutamate content of our ketchup we're going to make a puree of sundried tomato Tomatoes add a little bit of olive oil if they're not smooth enough and combine this with a bit of good oldfashioned ketchup this is going to add a few additional megat tons to our taste explosion each one of these steps is optional but this one is especially optional if you'd like to additionally amp up your mustard and if you like the taste of yellow miso combine the two last but certainly not least is the issue of cheese we're going to make parmesan cheese crisps by baking grated Parmesan at 350 for about 15 minutes season and sear the patties as usual and make sure you remove the burger from the heat before adding your spice powder unless you want to set off every smoke alarm in your ZIP code we're going to assemble our Burger properly this time starting with the Patty followed by some caramelized onions one of our oven dried tomatoes a bit of our Misa mustard a bit of Our sundried tomato ketchup this stuff is awesome a Parmesan cheese crisp and last where it belongs a handful of iceberg lettuce top your burger and slice in half for that cross-section and try to contain your embarrassment over the fact that you've overcooked a Patty but celebrate the fact that this burger is a Symphony of flavor you guys know me I don't clean my plate unless it's really really good especially because these things are going straight to my thighs before I blow up I'll take a double triple bossy Deluxe on a raft 4x4 animal style extra shingles with a shimmy and a squeeze light axle grease make it cry burn it and let it swim we serve food here sir hey what's up guys welcome back to binging with babish with this week I'd like to cordially welcome you to the new kitchen there's lots to do and see here but we'll get to that in due time time because we need to make bubble bass's order from SpongeBob and we will not forget the pickles an ingenious redditor with the username booin meticulously broke down the secret menu lingo and translated this into a 24 patty patty melt for which we are going to prepare our Mison plus we're going to start by slicing a whole bunch of tomatoes and shredding a whole bunch of iceberg lettuce we're going to remove the core from the bottom center of each half of our head of iceberg lettuce and then we're going to cut it into thin shreds and then cut it across the shreds to make smaller Burger appropriate pieces of iceberg lettuce and we're also going to finally chop a few white onions for the make it cry part of the order which refers to extra onions now onto the subject of bread he orders it on a raft which means Texas toast so we're going to cut thick slices of plain white sandwich bread and we're going to toast them up on the all new binging with babish six burner kitchen station but we need a griddle so hang on a second I just happen to have a 38 in griddle right here and this is going to come in handy because we have a lot of things to to fry up and this makes me feel like a real fry cook so I'm going to melt some butter and place our slices of Texas toast into the butter and Fry until golden brown we're not going to reapply butter because he orders it specifically with light axle grease referring to not too much butter we're going to set those aside because now it's time to deal with one of the most important parts of an animal style burger and that is caramelized onions we need a whole lot of onions eight in total sliced thinly and placed on our gigantic griddle or if you don't have one of these is a large fry pan with a little bit of oil over medium low heat and we're going to cook these for a solid hour I know that seems like a long time but that's the amount of time that you need to truly break down the sugars and create a soft Jammy mixture of onions add a little Spritz of water if they start to dry out too much and just be patient please your patience will be rewarded with the jamest of Jammy onions deep and rich in both color and complexity of flavor give them a little chop before you take them off The Griddle and set them aside because we need to make In-N-Out style spread which is an equal mixture of ketchup and Mayo with a Sprinkle of garlic powder onion powder a conservative pinch of kosher salt and an even more conservative sprinkle of paprika along with a few tablespoons of pickle juice once that's all nice and homogeneous it's time to start preparing to make Smash Burgers I'm going to measure out a 2 oz ball of meat nailed it first try cuz I'm a pro like that and then we're just going to sort of imitate the size and shape of that initial meatball until we have 24 identical slightly larger than golf ball siiz meatballs which we are going to throw down on a super hot griddle if you can't tell by all the smoke and using a large flat spatula smash them down they're going to cook for no more than 30 to 45 seconds before developing a beautiful brown crust which we're immediately going to hide under a layer of American pasteurized cheese product then as soon as that gets nice and melty it's time to head over to station three the assembly station where into a custommade aluminum foil trough we are going to stack high four patties at top two slices of toast followed by tomato onion shredded iceberger lettuce and then top the opposing piece of Texas toast with a healthy spread of spread and some of our delicious Jammy caramelized onions then according to Bin's recipe we stack two slices of Texas toast to top that mess and then start all over again six times all told so I'm doing eight patties at a time grilling them up and gently placing them into my Giant Burger trough rinsing and repeating until I have created six layers of 4x4 Burgers stacked on top of one another this is very hard to keep upright I don't know how booin did it but hats off to him eventually I managed to get the whole thing into a sort of Burger on which I am happy to say that I did not forget to stack a healthy sprinkling of pickles upon what is that a sentence I'm not entirely sure I'm tired because I've been making this monstrosity for the past 6 hours or so after some fruitless attempts to try and get this thing to sort of line up a little bit better we decided to say it divide it into six equal burgers and dig in now while this was not the most structurally sound sandwich I've ever swallowed it was a really acceptable Patty m but its structure leaves it inherently flawed I think we can do better so why don't we refer to Bubble bass's lesser known second order as a guideline for a much more reasonable quadruple patty melt I will have a quad Patty with a sprinkling of Himalayan salt smoked paprika I would like my patties be cheese but not just any cheese will do have you any aged Huda fussy cheese name pronunciation aside this has the makings of possibly a very good patty melt so let's fry them up stack them high top it with the requisite thinly sliced tomato shredded iceberg lettuce thinly sliced onions and of course do not forget the pickles this time even though he didn't specify them I'm going to keep the spread in caramelized onions cuz I think they're going to be really really good and why not and mercifully this results in a sandwich that can Christen in the new kitchen with its first cross-section not half bad a whole bunch of melty cheese and crispy juicy beef some flavorful toppings and some unorthodox but I would say on point cheese and spice choices on the part of bubble bass as you can see the sandwich is not structurally sound but it is tasty all in all this patty melt was a great way to ring in the new kitchen with or without [Music] pickles I may be down but I'm not out way to go buddy it took us 3 days to make that potato salad three days hey what's up guys welcome back to binging with babish where this week we're taking a look at potato salad moreover how it could possibly take 3 days to make potato salad personally I just think the guy was trying to make an unrepentant SpongeBob feel guilty but it gave me an idea and that was to pickle the potatoes I had heard of a few restaurants pickling their potatoes before making french fries and I figured that lacto fermented Funk could go really well in potato salad so we're packing our potatoes into mason jars and Topping them with a little cabbage bonus topper this is just going to bring a little extra flavor to the party and then we're going to weigh them down with some fermentation weights because any potatoes that float above the brine are subject to oxidation speaking of which we are making a brine that is 2 and 1/2 tbsp of kosher salt to 4 cups of water we're going to stir that up real nice until everybody's dissolved and then pour the brine over top of the potatoes this is about as simple as pickling gets once we've got those filled up to the bottom lip of the jars we're going to fix our Lids I've got these dope little airlock lids for fermentation but bear in mind that you can do this entire process in a bowl with some plastic wrap if you want just make sure that everybody's submerged to use a glass bowl but however you do it we are letting these guys sit for 3 days straight I obviously don't feel like waiting that long so with a snap of my editor fingers we got ourselves some lacto fermented potatoes now that stark white mush that we see in the bowl strikes me as the absolute standard potato salad that is half a minced onion one rib of minced celery half a cup of mayo 2 tbsp of white wine vinegar a pinch of sugar a generous sprinkling maybe 1 teaspoon of garlic powder an inexplicable and roughly chopped hard-boiled egg a little kosher salt and freshly ground pepper to taste and you've got the basic dressing for basic potato salad but we can't have the color or variety that com from skin on potatoes so we need to go with some simply cubed russets that I similarly pickled for 3 days I'm going to Simply drain these and boil them for about 15 minutes or until completely tender and then once cooled add them to our potato salad dressing you can obviously substitute regular boiled potatoes in this recipe if you want we're going to give them a tender stir a gentle dump into our serving bowl and there you have it the absolute standard American potato salad AKA a bowl of mayo with some potatoes in it so naturally it tastes quite good do the Pickled potato make much of a difference not really because especially after only 3 days the Tang is pretty subtle so it's getting drowned out by the mayonnaise why don't we try a bit more sophisticated potato salad courtesy of Undisputed food God J Kenji Lopez alt so after boiling our potatoes to tooth some completion we are finally chopping half of one red onion about 2 or 3 tbsp of sour cream a deluge of freshly chopped dill or about 3 tbsps worth a tablespoon or two of white wine vinegar a few pinches of kosher salt to taste some freshly ground pepper will go in light on the seasoning cuz we're going to have to add more down the line some slimly sliced scallions and I like a few finely chopped chives probably doesn't do anything but I don't know I had extra chives I mean look at all the chives I have we're mixing all this together before forgetting that we almost forgot to add a tablespoon and a half of olive oil along with one large Fork handle full of whole grain mustard we're then mixing that to combine and then adding our boiled and cooled potatoes I feel like I'm saying the word potato a lot let's come up with another name for these things how about uh scoot do no we'll just call them potatoes anyway we're mixing our potatoes into the dressing and putting them in our serving bowl and there you have it the best potato salad in the observable universe let's give it a try and see if using pickled potatoes made a difference and the answer is kind of they've definitely got that fermentation Funk but it's getting lost underneath that flavorful dressing I've only got one more potato salad trick up my sleeve and that is to go full guy Fury and make a deep fried potato salad that really resembles something more like potatus bravas so we're just deep frying our potatoes for about 8 minutes just enough time to make some old school mortar and pestle aoli we're starting by crushing two large garlic cloves into a paste using the mortar and pestle then once you got yourself a nice smooth paste we're going to add two egg yolks this is going to add a distinct egg yolk like quality to our aoli then using the pestle I think that's what this part is called we're just going to mix up the egg yolks with the garlic until they are well combined and then while mixing rapidly we're going to slowly drizzle in some neutral flavored oil like canola or vegetable until an Emulsion forms then once your aoli has outgrown its mortar I think that's what that is called we're taking the party back to my place my place being a larger Bowl now we're going to bring some more flavorful oil to the party that is some olive oil any second now here it comes 1 2 3 and there we go you can switch off oils as necessary to your taste I like a mixture of both but either way we are whisking constantly while very very slowly adding oil until a thick Emulsion forms maybe about a half a cup of combined oils for every egg yolk then once we have a nice thick aoli we need to taste it to make sure it's not too harsh and then seon to taste with kosher salt by this time your potatoes should be done frying deeply golden brown on the outside and tender on the inside we draining those on paper towels before placing in a bowl tossing with a little bit of kosher salt and smoked paprika which is going to get us a little bit closer to patus bravas start the music make sure that everybody's dancing and then pour out onto a serving plate and then we're just going to top these simply with aoli and some scallions if we can get the aoli to come out of the freaking bottle come on here we go perfect drizzle in 3 2 1 oh okay it's fine my kitchen ceiling's been looking really boring lately we're topping these guys with a smattering of scallions and there you have it something that can almost very charitably be called potato salad and it was at this moment that I remembered that Yukon potatoes do not respond well to deep frying the flavors were good but the texture was all off it was gummy so maybe it's time to take this recipe back to its inspiration which is pickled french fries there's a restaurant called Owl in San Francisco where they pickle their potatoes before making them into French fries so I thought I would try just that with the fry free then refry method if you want to see how to do that click the link in the upper right hand corner right now and then toss with a little bit of kosher salt while still warm and let's see how they taste and I've got to say fermented french fries are an interesting snack they're sour and funky and barely even need to be dipped in ketchup and I really recommend that you make all the previous recipes with normal potatoes unless you're trying to make a sponge feel bad and here's your triple gooberberry Sunrise sir yum oh triple gooberberry Sunrise huh well I guess I could use one of those H you're talking hey waiter we need another one over here there you go woo hey what's up guys welcome back to binging with babish where this week we're taking a look at the hotly requested triple gooberberry Sunrise from SpongeBob SquarePants now let's get down to the business of making Sundays first up we have to make a custard I'm starting with one cup of whole milk and SpongeBob and Patrick looked like they were in kind of an old timey soda shop so I'm going to add 15 gam of non-diastatic malt powder which I'm going to aggressively whisk using a full- siize whisk because this stuff likes to Clump once fully Incorporated I'm going to add two cups of heavy cream then just like any ice cream base this stuff needs a sweetener but I wanted to try to add at least one unders sea ingredient so I'm going to add 15 G of caragan a red seaweed extract that's commonly used as a thickener and that's going to make for a smoother more scoopable ice cream this stuff also loves to Clump but if we tiny whisk it into our sugar it's going to get dispersed more evenly and fully dissolve without putting up a fuss now the next step is to make sure that both everybody is dissolved and homogeneous and also bring our mixture up to the barest of simmers we just want little bubbles forming around the outside of the pot stir frequently to make sure that the milk doesn't Scorch kill the heat once he starts seeing the little Bubbles and then it's time to start tempering our eggs more accurately five large egg yolks that we're going to place in a heat proof bowl and swaddle with a moistened towel that will allow us to whisk one-handedly as we slowly Ladle in the hot milk and cream mixture at first you want to add this in a very very very slow stream but by the third or fourth Ladle full your eggs will be tempered and you can add it faster all in all we want to whisk about a third of the hot stuff into the cold stuff before adding the cold stuff back into the hot stuff Mak sense good because now we're headed back to the stove top where over medium low heat we're going to bring this mixture up to 185° F whisking pretty constantly to make sure that nobody's scrambling on the bottom of the pot and you'll know it's done both when it reaches 185° F and when it reaches a state that the French referred to as nut which roughly translates to thick enough to coat the back of a spoon and to leave a trail when a finger is draged dragged across its surface actually I think it literally translates to tablecloth but whatever next up during their Sunday consumption SpongeBob and Patrick appeared to be getting anbri so this being from a cartoon we're going to incorporate a little bit of this brown liquid from this bottle marked XXX one can only imagine what this brown liquid could possibly be but let's just say that it's uh whiskey so once killing the heat under our custard we're going to add about 2 oz of XXX mystery brown liquid plus the sliced and scraped carcass of one vanilla bean we're doing this while the custard is still husk so that the flavors can better steep that being said the faster we cool off our custard the better so we're placing a smaller Bowl into a larger Bowl filled with salted ice and water and pouring the custard into the smaller Bowl basically the ice is going to cool things off the salt is going to make the ice disperse its coldness faster and the water is going to make sure that the coolness is evenly distributed we're whisking occasionally for about 10 minutes until it reaches 72° fhe covering with plastic wrap and fridging for at least 4 hours or until fully chilled and ready to churn then we're churning via your churning method of ch voice making sure to remember to remove that vanilla pod trying desperately and failing to get our lid into place come on there we go and turning for about 35 minutes or until we get a consistency similar to very firm soft surf if you don't have an ice cream machine go ahead and click the link in the upper right hand corner right now to see how to make ice cream by hand however you turn it it's now ready to head into the freezer so we're going to scrape out as much of this delicious Gunk as we possibly can into the freezer safe vessel of your choice optionally press some wax paper or plastic wrap directly down onto the surface to prevent freezer burn cover it up and freezer it for at least 4 hours ideally overnight plenty of time to contend with the thing that I might be allergic to so I'm wearing gloves the festive bananas that we're going to have visibly jutting out of all different points of the Sunday so we're peeling them slicing them in half and repeatedly skewering them with toothpicks this would obviously make them hazardous to eat at the speed at which SpongeBob and Patrick were eating them but I'm positive that there's no other way that they're going to stay in place I'm also going to pop these in the freezer for about an hour to increase their rigidity then finally it's time to assemble our triple gooberberry Sunrise we got ourselves an old school looking Blue Glass ice cream bowl into which we are going to deposit three very large scoops of ice cream and I got to say guys this caragan stuff makes for very scoopable ice cream this stuff spent over 12 hours in the freezer and it's still super soft now I'm just going to place it back into the freezer for 15 to 20 minutes to make sure that there is no extraneous meltage during assembly first up our little ice cream buddy appears to have a hot fudge hairdo so I'm just going to place a generous dollop of cooled fudge on top of the top scoop top that with the banana hat and flank with our two banana arms then the face appeared to be made from green blue and red candies so I've got green and blue M&M's and one red peanut &m which we really got to shove in there to make them stay in place and then an inviting red licorice smile then I assume that the triple gooberberry refers to these three Marino cherries delicately skewered on the end of each banana and there you have it the triple gooberberry oh hang on a second fix the eye here a fast disintegrating but mildly intoxicating ice cream sunde now to give it a try thank the most upsetting thing to do would be take a scoop out of this guy's face sorry little friend and I'll tell you right now this is far in away the best homemade ice cream I've ever made the texture is pretty much commercial quality it has a nice boozy flavor but it's not overwhelming thanks to The Malt but in this whole Sunday there's just about a half a shot of bourbon total and SpongeBob and Pat ate like 10 of these each so it kind of makes sense but if you're trying to cut back on calories you might just want to pour some XXX liquid directly on top ooh that's somehow even more upsetting kind of like the ending of Raiders the Lost Arc and as an ice cream topping it's just kind of so so anyway if you'll excuse me I'm going to run and grab my epip pen because I think I'm allergic to bananas our peanuts jar is totally empty wait I know one other place we can find [Music] peanuts good thing I still have these peanut plants growing in the window sill a little texture never hurt there we go this sunde is going to taste great I don't know somehow I doubt that hey what's up guys welcome back to to binging with babish where this week we're taking a look at SpongeBob's onion ketchup and peanut plant Sunday and yes this is an actual peanut plant that I bought on Etsy it's too young to have yet yielded any nuts but I think ultimately that's not going to matter so for the TV show accurate version we are Weeping as we thinly slice a large videlia onion filling a bowl with our ice cream surrogate AKA a whole bottle of ketchup scattering our videlia onions across the top and leaving plenty of room for our Tennessee red organic airlo peanut plant roots dirt and all as SpongeBob said a little texture never hurt except that eating dirt is a very effective way to give yourself a parasite I had to Google that and I came across a lot of articles on the subject because apparently there's a lot of people out there that like to eat dirt I however am not one of them so I'm going to carefully scoop around the dirt grab some peanut greens which are apparently perfectly edible and here we go let's try a bite of SpongeBob's improvised to Sunday which I hopefully shouldn't have to tell you is not very good it's ketchup onions and leaves it's like eating a burger without the bun or the burger and yes it did give me rancid breath so making an edible version of this is going to take some doing I'm thinking the only way to do it is to make ice creams flavored after the different parts of the Sunday first up the onions I have two large videlia onions that I've haved and thinly sliced which I'm now going to caramelize I'm going to start by gently sautéing them over medium low heat adding a little kosher salt freshly ground pepper and then I'm going to cook them covered stirring occasionally

,[Music] uh sorry what what's this it's for you but don't tell uh but what for take it unless you want to have chowder for dinner [Music] again I think that was the most delicious dinner I've had in all 16 years of my life [Music] hello there welcome back to another episode of anime with Alvin where today we're going to be making the Japanese Big Mac from weathering with you now in the movie this pig Mac looks ethereal shinkai Makoto has a knack for animation lighting and just making things look really beautiful and this Big Mac is no exception it bounces a little bit once the lid is open and is probably one of the most perfect Burgers I've ever seen in my life and I feel like giving someone that burger when they're at a little bit of a low point in life could really just pick them up which I think is really good excuse to try and make the Big Mac but the way they do it in Japan now while we were in Japan Tony and I made an Excursion to just a local McDonald's where we had to go and Sample what the Big Mac was like especially having eaten the ones from the states we were really curious to see if it was any different and upon opening the box it definitely was this one looked way more presentable and had more attention and detail when it comes to assembling the sandwich itself it basically looked near perfect the bun was nice and smooth and upon taking a bite it was the best big MEC I've ever had it didn't even taste like fast food at that point just tasted like a really good burger the beef was flavorful not overcooked the sauce was a little bit lighter and Tangier than the one we are used to maybe because they used Cy Mayo the lettuce wasn't hazly thrown everywhere and everything just came together so well and so nice that we really wanted to see how we can make a version of this at home so once we got back to the States we had to go and make sure that there was quite a different so we ordered a regular Big Mac this is just the one that we got from a local McDonald's here in New York and upon opening the box I think we are confirming that the ones in Japan have a clear advantage over the ones here this one seems to not have the same attention to detail when it comes to being assembled and upon looking at it the beef is really overcooked the bun is kind of dry and tough and the lettuce is thrown a little bit everywhere the cheese really isn't even melted um and after taking a bite it was a clear step down from the one we had in Japan so what can we do to make a Japanese style Big Mac the way that reminds us of the perfect one that we had in Japan so let's let's first start with the bun The Bun in Japan was a little softer and a little sweeter I'm guessing maybe took inspiration from some sort of shokupan or milk bread recipe so that is exactly what we are going to do and to make a bun that's a little bit softer with a little bit of that sweetness we're going to start by making a Tang Jong which is essentially just a r you make with milk and flour you just mix it together and you cook it until it becomes a sticky ball that isn't sticky anymore as a starter we're going to combine 3 tbsp of water 3 tbsp of milk and 2 tbspoon of bread flour in a pan and just essentially stir fry it I guess until it turns into a ball this will be a St latinized starch that will help give the rest of our dough a little bit more softness once we throw that in the dough is pretty standard in a stand mixture we're going to combine 300 G of bread flour 14 G of non-fat dry milk 50 g of sugar 6 G of table salt a tablespoon of instant yeast half a cup of whole milk one large egg and 4 tbspoon of melted butter and Once the dough starts to come together I'm going to take the little ball of tongue Zone that we made earlier and just rip that into a little pieces and wait for that to incorporate after mixing the dough until it is nice and glutenous and sticky this is now going to just proof and rest in a oiled container that is sealed for about 2 hours or so until it is proofed and nice and puffy all right on to the beef so I noticed in Japan upon Examining The Patty of the Big Mac itself it's less of a beef patty that you would find in a traditional burger and it has the texture of almost a bouncy sausage patty which had a lot more fat and MiFi in between and less of those I guess like manuals meat that you might eat when you're eating a regular burger so we're going to make our own ground beef we're going to take it farther though so first we're going to start with 1 and2 lb of chuck roast that we've just cubed into 1 in and then we're going to put that on a tray and let that freeze until it is about 80% Frozen so it's ready to grind we're aiming for like an 80/20 ratio but my hunch is that McDonald's has a higher fat content in their beef so we'll adjust according to what we think feels best okay so we actually did some research online for what the sauce entails there's a lot of recipes out there but we're using a recipe by someone who used to work work at McDonald's that claims that this one comes really close so here we go instead of regular mayo though we're going to use half2 cup of cupy mayonnaise then we're going to add 2 tspoon of sweet relish tablespoon of sugar half a teaspoon of rice vinegar half a teaspoon of paprika half a teaspoon of garlic powder half a teaspoon of onion powder just a pinch of white pepper because that seems pretty popular in Japanese Cuisine overall giving that a mix and a taste it does in fact taste exactly like the Big Mac sauce that I had in Japan which was quite some time ago but the fact that it reminded me of it very closely I think we're spot on with the sauce here and the Q mayonnaise gives it a lighter taste okay so one interesting thing that we saw in Japan was that not only do they have a Big Mac they have something called a samurai Mac which is essentially a Teriyaki style glazed Patty the patties are dunked in some Teriyaki glaze and then putting on a Big Mac which sounds really really delicious so we're just going to make some of that for fun plus it's a good way to use of all the random bottles of soy sauce and stuff we have lying around so in just a giant sauce pot we're going to combine a ratio of approximately 1 to one of soy sauce and meting and then half of that of sugar and another half of that of sake so the ratio is 2211 of soy sauce mean sugar and sake and this is not a real real recipe I'm just kind of using up all these leftover bottles and making a nice sweet soy sauce if it's too salty add more sugar if it's too sweet add more soy sauce obviously this is way more than we'll need but it's a nice sauce that obviously goes with anything and I plan to take home a lot of it after this is done okay now that our beef is pretty much solidified we're going to go and blend that in a food processor my preferred method of making ground beef and then we're going to actually add a little bit more fat we asked Rachel to go get some fat and we have beef sew which is fat taken somewhere between the membranes on the cow so you have to make sure to take out those membranes you kind of get this crumbly beef fat that I'm going to add in and pulse until the beef almost turns into a pink-l like paste usually you don't go this far for just normal Burgers but I think the Big Mac Patty is a little bit more emulsified then I'm going to shape about six of these and since we have so much left over beef we can either make more Patties or because I have an idea on how to make something fun I'm going to save the rest of this ground beef in a large pile and show you what you can do with that later so McDonald's uses not fresh onion for their Big Macs but they're sort of these onions that have been rehydrated from dry that will retain that onion flavor but they don't have that acidity or that wateriness of fresh onions which I think is actually a huge plus so we're going to give it two attempts we're going to use these onion pieces just that we have and we're going to hydrate that with water and we're also going to slice some fresh onions and microwave it to get a little bit of that acidity out and just see if that compares okay our Dove has been proved acely doubled in size so I'm going to shape that into little balls and put them inside some baking molds that a little taller than usual we have a DIY mold made with foil we have a tall pastry ring and we have a small spring form pan all which will yield slightly different layers of buns and uh we'll see which one works the best and to brush a little bit of water on top and sprinkle some sesame seeds and put that into the oven to bake at approximately 350° for roughly 20 to 25 minutes while that's going on I'm going to go ahead and carefully cut the lettuce into nice little shapes that look very similar to the ones that we had in Japan discarding any ugly outside leaves when trying to use the more prettier sides to cut into thin little strips okay now it's time to char Our Patties and get on moving with the rest of our Burger this is pretty simple you smash them in a pan the thinner the better because they're going to shrink up a little bit has of salt and pepper and take them out before they're overcooked all right let's take a look at our buns so we accidentally did the thing where we put in the Buns while the oven was still preheating and because this oven is a express preheater that means it blasts in a ton of heat from the top Heating element which means it almost broiled our buns uh we're still looking at these definitely a little bit darker than we have like but I've honestly think it's a little bit salvageable if we use the one that is less dark obviously would not recommend doing that but lesson learn it's probably safest to put in your food in the oven when it is finished preheating not during let's slice this bun that looks the less dark out of all three into three parts the top bun the bottom bun and the middle part which is referred to as the crown and we're going to toast these a dry toast in a pan cuz I don't believe the ones at McDonald's have any butter in them they look pretty dry toasted which I think makes sense for a rich burger like this then we are going to begin with assembly now according to the way Big Macs are assembled it's the bot and Bun Then followed by a layer of Big Mac sauce a sprinkling of lettuce then goes on cheese and the Patty which I'm guessing uses the residual heat of the Patty to slightly melt the cheese then we put on some dehydrated onions I honestly prefer the taste of the rehydrated dry ones than the microwave fresh ones so those are going to go back in the samurai sauce after the onions we're going to go ahead with the crown bun then more sauce then lettuce then pickles no cheese this time then a Patty then more onions and a bun so there's actually only one slice of cheese in a Big Mac and one layer of pickles on the top and this might sound odd why don't you put two slices of cheese but speaking from personal experience with the person that actually runs the McDonald's Test Kitchen he definitely knows what he's doing and there's a reason for that I'm sure it's a balance of flavor okay so this is our homemade Japanese style inspired Big Mac clearly a little too big I think it's a little little thick on both the bun and the meat could have done that a little bit thinner so let's give that a look and taste and as far as tastes wise tastes pretty good I like the sweetness of the bun but I do think we cut it a little too thick and the Patty should definitely be half thickness so we're going to try to do this again with half the thickness of the bun and half the thickness of the Patty and do the samurai version let's see if that helps the ratios so we're going to assemble it the same exact way but this time before putting the Patty On the Bun I'm going to dunk them in our Samurai glaze which has reduced by half and has a nice sweet soy tanginess and onion flavor to it which is really cool and all the klines in the patties does catch a lot of the sauce so we're going to assemble these just like usual but I'm going to personally add a second slice of cheese on top I think that'll go well with the blaze let's cross-section this obviously it's really tall but it's pretty cool everything is super thick but I'm sure the one in Japan is u a little bit smaller and well poor proportion I guess that American and me just kind of came out a little bit if we really wanted to make a one to1 Recreation I think we'd have to work on making the Buns even softer even thinner and somehow get those patties to be super super super small which I've heard is actually cooked in a double griddle at McDonald itself which would maintain its thin shape okay after getting a cross-section and taking a bite of this I personally do prefer the flavor of the Samurai one a lot more I think from a balance point of view the soy sweetness goes really well with the cheese the beef and that Tangy Big Mac sauce so honestly if they serve this in the States this is the one I would eat every day of the week maybe not every day that would be not good for your health okay so now for leftovers and how we're going to turn the leftovers into some fun stuff so the trick I like to use when it comes to you know getting rid of a lot of meat or cheese is this you take a whole entire sheet of these Hawaiian bread rolls either the medium one or the large one and instead of tearing them into their squares I actually like to cut them straight down the side so essentially bisecting this into two sheets a top sheet and a bottom sheet now this is where the fun begins with a large portion I was talking about earlier I'm actually going to take a rectangular tray and press this massive meat Mount of ground beef into a roughly rectangular shape approximately the size of a she of paper 8 and 1/2 by 11 accounting for shrinkage and making sure to Salt it because well there's not much time to Salt it afterwards you could do that in a g grle but I think baking it Cooks it a lot more evenly and gets the beef into that nice square shape so they can lay that directly on top after you Dent the bottom a little bit to make some room this beef patty rectangle is going to go on top and then we're going to satisfyingly add some slices of American cheese because rectangles are just squares this will definitely make sense from a geometrical point of view then on top we're going to add any leftover onions that we had lying around and we throw this back into the oven until the cheese has melted and the onions have started to dehydrate a little bit more and then with a top sheet of that Hawaiian roll bun I'm going to brush these a little bit of butter and add the sesame seeds and throw those into the oven till it's nice and toasty then we're going to turn that upside down bring it out put the Big Mac sauce and some lettuce on the top sheet and put the pickles on the bottom sheet so that way we don't heat up everything that doesn't need to be heated then we're going to carefully throw the top on the bottom making sure not to Splatter things too much and then after a nice little press I'm going to cut these into their own individual squares because the Buns on the Hawaiian rolls have conveniently indented themselves where they need to be cut not that we have that everybody can have a Big Mac slider or Mini Mac or Mac Mini although I think that's a technological device anyways these are satisfyingly proportioned as the beef patty is nicely well ratioed with the bun which is really soft and honestly after eating one of these this in fact was the closest flavor that we had to the one in Japan the bun was so squishy So Soft so delicious the flavors and the ratios were completely correct and I guess the lesson learned was that you know you can spend your own time making things like your own bread but honestly if there's things out there that are just doing it right and it's hard to compete I'd prefer to just buy those and use those because those are just delicious anyways and after everybody had one to eat and to sample we made sure to pack the rest home for whoever wanted it most for Christmas and that would be Tony happy holidays everybody he

,what's easier than a pie tastier than a cookie and more versatile than a tart a glette of course this apple Bri gallette is delicious as a side or on its own and it's all thanks to the shatteringly crisp crust that's pretty hard to mess up first we're going to shred 10 tbspoon of Frozen Danish cramy butter and mix that up in a bowl with flour 6 tablespoons of ice water adding more as needed until a Shaggy dough forms press it into a puck and let it chill for 30 minutes then roll it out into a 14in circle and fridge it once more the colder you keep the dough the flakier the final result in the meantime we're going to make a super simple apple filling of thinly sliced apples the juice of half a lemon it's accompanying zest some freshly grated nutmeg and cardamom combine and let the apples mate for 10 minutes draining and reserving the juices to assemble the scallet start by laying a foundation of bre bricks optionally garnishing with some freshly chopped Rosemary then assemble your apple slices in a decorative pattern I went for two concentric circles brush the crust down with a beaten egg and bake at 400° fhe for about 45 minutes take it out the oven brush the filling with some of that mation juice and the crust with some melted butter finish it with salt and a decorative sprig of rosemary then let it cool for about 10 minutes and dig in my heart told me to eat it like a pizza but my mind told me to fork and knife it in the end I did both which is truly the only way to enjoy this crust which really stole the show [Music] [Music],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
