4l97aNza_Zc,"Take off your blindfolds! These two people used to date. They had a four-year romantic relationship
and now they're exes. And if they spend 30 days
chained together… I will give them $250,000. How long ago did
you two date? Three years ago. She broke up with me. He's salty. I can't force you guys to do it, but once you clip on the handcuffs,
the 30 day challenge has begun. I’m locked in. - Oh, gosh.
- They're both handcuffed. From this point forward, if either of you decide to quit
by crossing this red line, I will instantly unhandcuff
both of you. The video is over,
but neither of you wins anything. Have fun, you two. My ex-boyfriend?
Really, Jimmy? Bro, what? - What’s up, dude?
- Hi. Can I give you a-- Oh. Oh. Where are we? This is your happy home
for the next 30 days. This is the kitchen. You can hang out.
You can workout. You have separate beds. There's a question mark door,
we'll worry about that later. And most importantly,
you're probably wondering, since you two are handcuffed together,
how do you use the bathroom? Oh, no. Someone go in the bathroom. Stop it! I have to shower
with this on? Yeah, if you take it off at any point,
the video is over. Slide the handcuffs in there. Wait. You guys are cruel! Boom! Hey, she needs
more slack. But what if she has to use the toilet. Hey! Wait, I can't believe I'm in the same room
as you right now. - Yeah, and you're kinda stuck with me.
- Yeah. - Wait, am I stuck with you?
- Oh, gosh. Actually, Suzie has been through
this kind of challenge before when she lasted 100 days in a room
with a complete stranger. But this time, she's trapped
with someone she knows a little too well. One thing to decide, do we even wanna be
eating together? I don't know. Ok, Josh is showering right now so I feel like it's time to get
my honest thoughts out there. I'm nervous for this challenge. We dated four years.
We're broken up for three, and now we're locked
together in a box. At some point, someone's gonna
have to start saying something. Ay, ay, ay. - Jeez.
- Sorry. Well, you might as well
leave it on now. It's the morning of day two, and our exes are still trying
to find their own rhythm. You fed me. That equals happy woman. With this 60-foot chain,
they can live their own separate lives. And that's exactly what
they're choosing to do. I was picturing like if we were actually
chained close together and I was feeling
a little scared. Are you scared
to be close to me? She really should be.
Because this chain will shrink, and these two exes will be forced
to confront each other. Get me out of here! You make me wanna die. But for now, just living together
is proving to be pretty difficult. - You get wet?
- Uh, huh. Oh, sorry! With the disgusting pan grease
all over me. Sorry. On that note, I'm gonna go lock myself
away in the shower. Here's the deal. I've been pretty rough
on her today. She deserves it.
You broke up with me. I feel like we should talk
about our problems eventually. I want to acclimate a little bit more
before just yapping. It's been a few days
since we've seen Jimmy in here. I'm ready for some action
'cause right now, this is the vibe. Silence at all times. Things are so bad between them I wonder if a shorter chain
would bring them closer together, or tear them apart. It's day five,
and time for the first offer. Happy day five! Wait why are you guys
on opposite sides of the room? 'Cause we can be. Well, come on over. You're coming up on a week.
How's it been? It's just like, I'm getting kind of
used to her being here. It's hard to even like,
really talk about things. - Oh.
- Yeah. To celebrate five days
of being chained together, you're being served
a very special offer. Your chain is about to shrink
no matter what. Bro. Offer #1 is a 50 foot chain, 10 feet shorter than
what you currently have. - Mhm.
- Ok. Offer #2 is a 30 foot chain,
your current chain cut in half. And if you choose this one,
we will add $25,000 to your prize pool. If you guys wanna make $25,000
while sitting around in here then you would choose
this 30 foot chain. No, that's so short. If you choose this chain, you'll have to live a lot closer
to each other. I mean I was around you
for four years for free. I mean, I can be a little closer for-- That's crazy. An extra 10K. Do you want your chain
cut in half? I'm saying yes. I'm with it.
Let's do it. Ok. Nolan, let's cut
the chain in half! Oh, gosh. Their chain has officially
been cut in half. Good luck
to the two of you. Cheers. I'm not regretful
of taking more money. Well we still have
25 days, but we also haven't really figured out
that this is shorter yet. Like, we haven't bumped into the issue
of it being too short yet. It'll probably happen
in a very short amount of time. Ohh! Like right now! Oh! Not even 24 hours into the chain
being half the length. We are already having problems. Even right now, Josh is showering
while I'm sitting at the table. I would love to be
on my bed right now, but the chain doesn't reach
the bed anymore. At 4 a.m. got woken up by Josh
to go to the bathroom. I need to go to the bathroom. [groans] The chain being shorter,
it's very uncomfortable in here. My God, 6 feet distance
at all times please. Ew! You just got your sweat
all over my forehead. Hey, I’m kind of walking! I’m Josh,
I'm immature. [mocking voice] My name is Suzie. You're looking pretty gross. Thanks! D-Bag. I think this challenge might be easier
if it was with a stranger. I know you're working on it.
I know you're trying your absolute best, but you're absolutely insane. [gasps] You're being disrespectful to me. - It's not disrespect.
- You're being mean. This morning I started with a comment,
and then we kept having an issue about it. To be real, the problem with the comment
was that you're like, making fun of me in hopes that
people would join in. To also point fun at me. Bro, you're actually delusional. Suzie in the psych ward. I really don't know how I'm gonna feel
about you at the end of this. It's been an absolute fiasco. It feels like she escalates it
when it's like, ""No, no. Just a comment.
I'm not hating on you."" - You know what’s crazy?
- You. Funny. Let's see if we go one day
without Josh pissing me off. Pardon? You keep saying things to embarrass me,
and I don't appreciate it. It's literally a joke. No, that's so embarrassing to do
to another person when who knows how many people
are watching us! Oh, like ""that's disrespectful"" thing
has turned it into a bit. I'm not thinking
in bits right now, I'm thinking in how I feel
I'm being treated. - Everything's about you.
- It's not. You're the star
and I'm the accessory. It's not all about me at all. It's--
we're equal partners. Josh is the one who did it.
Josh pissed me off. It's Josh's fault. Because I feel like you're saying things
that make me wanna die. I apologize,
it's totally understandable. But the only way that we're gonna
kill that now is to let that be yesterday. I wanna make it 30 days
and be done. I'm certain that you do as well. Yeah. This is more rough
than I thought it was gonna be. We're not gonna survive this
if it keeps going like today did. But I think we should try. Absolutely, I think we should try. We're just in here to survive, win money,
and then never speak again. Fresh start? Sure. And though they agreed to get along
for the sake of the challenge, I wanted to see just how committed
they were on the next check-in day. It's day 10! Yeah! To celebrate, we’re going to-- Oh, no. Shrink your chain by 10 feet! - Woohoo!
- Yay! For free. Oh. But before we do that, obviously, shortening the chain last time
led to some personal space issues. [groans] And because in the future days, the two of you will have an opportunity
to make a lot of money, in exchange for shrinking your chain, for one time only,
I'm gonna unbolt the furniture, let you guys move it around,
and then bolt it back down permanently. Oh. But first, let's update your chain. Can't wait. And to help move things around… Alright, alright, alright! Here is your expert crew. Alright. You have until midnight tonight to move
whatever you want around. Should we get to it? Yeah, rotate, rotate, rotate. After putting the boys to work, Suzie and Josh moved all the furniture
within each area closer to each other, with an emphasis
on one area in particular. This is our bathroom and our bed. What we have tonight is what we will have
for 20 more days. It's survivable. And to sweeten the deal,
I gave them one more surprise. - Suzie, Josh.
- Chandler. We got a fridge full
of our brand new Feastables! - No way!
- Let’s go! Sorry, guys. This is our first time
revealing our chocolate milk. Oh! Cheers! Cheers. That's good. It's also made
with real whole milk and loaded with vitamins A, D,
and potassium. You took the words
right out of my mouth. It tastes amazing. Go find Feastables chocolate milk at Walmart, 7-Eleven,
and Speedway locations nationwide. This is the best part
of the whole challenge. Even though the chain got shorter, moving the furniture put Josh and Suzie
in a better mood. The chain shrunk 10 feet, and so far today
we haven't had any problems with it. Is there anything you're concerned about? Being too close. Ok. Even though their fighting continued, the chain was actually
starting to bring them closer. And over time,
they were becoming friends again. We're super bored today
and we've eaten a lot of Lunchly, so we're gonna put it up on the wall
in a heart shape. And now I present to you
the first Lunchly heart in the world. Josh wanted to lay down and journal
at the same time as I wanted to walk
on the treadmill. This is our compromise. Thank you, Josh. We should be working together
to get out of here. Yeah, we have to get through
everything. - Friends?
- Friends. But now that they were finally
getting along, Josh couldn't help but wonder, why didn't they work out
in the first place? Hey Suzie, can we talk? We didn't have a bad breakup. You wanted to go do other things
that didn't line up with what I was doing. Like, a reoccurring thing
in the past was, I felt as if I had to be sharing with you
what I wanted all the time. Honestly, I think if I were to
entertain something again… I would need to feel that it's like,
very different than before. What did you do after we broke up? Bawling my eyes out
because I was so alone. What’d you do when we broke up? I started crying. Like not following you but never
forgetting your Instagram handle. Searching it up every other week. But it was weird like watching your life
in third person after being a part of it
for so long. Felt like my heart split in two. Don't cry. I was still madly in love with you
when I broke up with you. I didn't want to break up.
I never wanted to do that. [chuckling] I don't think I ever like
fully stopped loving you. What? So what do we do? I feel like this challenge is allowing me
to see Josh in a whole new light. It has been… eye opening. The only problem is,
what happens in this room is not a good representation
of what life is in the real world. Even though Josh and Suzie were making
breakthroughs in their relationship, this was still a 30-day challenge, and the isolation from the outside world
was starting to get to Josh. Literally gave up my entire life
outside of here to be here. And it's just now really setting in. Bro, I haven’t been outside in two weeks.
My whole life is outside. If I had to pay to get outside access,
I would not do that. I just want to be outside, bro! What's up? I don't feel well. Mentally. And that's why on day 15, we had the perfect solution
to their biggest problem. For day 15, we wanted to offer you guys
an outdoor space. I'm giving you the chance to unlock
the outdoors and double your space. That means full access
to the entire yard whenever you want. But here's the catch: you guys wanna keep
this outdoor area, you're gonna have to switch
to a 10-foot chain. I've been missing the outside. We might have a better view
of like the sunset or even sunrise. Yeah but I don't think that's worth
losing half our chain. If we take this off
for just getting to go outside, we're always this close. We shouldn't do it, and we can easily
sacrifice not having sunlight. I just don't want it
to be a missed opportunity further down the line. I’m very tempted to take this. Ten feet halfway through
though means who knows how much
wiggle room we'll have, though? You guys have had time
to talk about it. Are you taking the day 15 offer? Yeah, no. Alright well, go back inside. We’re just gonna enjoy it
for one more minute. Yeah, there's a 10 second timer. - I'm up. I’m in, I’m in.
- 10, 9, 8, 7… 6-5-4-3-2-1! See ya in a few days. Alright. Do you feel regretful now that
we jumped inside? I don't know.
I do miss the outside. Turning down the day 15 offer
really took a toll on Josh. And the next day, the thought of
going outside was still eating at him. It’s a little bit, um, depressing today. You just woke up. Thinking it was Mystery Door and not. Having nothing change
about our daily life. This is the longest month of my life. The day that we were expecting something
big to happen, nothing happened. Why has today felt so long? Well hopefully the Mystery Door
whatever it is, it’s something good. Do you have any new thoughts
on what's in that room? Oh my gosh,
there's Teslas back there. That'd be crazy. Here's the thing,
this isn't the first time Suzie has faced
a mystery challenge. In a previous video,
she turned down a mystery box that had $50,000
and her favorite car, a Tesla. And it crushed her. Oh, I wanna cry.
That's literally my dream. They got us Teslas! If it's a Tesla behind those doors, we have to take it,
just for my redemption arc. Come on. But for Josh, the excitement
of the Mystery Door still wasn't enough
to bring him out of his funk. [groan] Feelin’ like I'm going crazy. Violence, bro. [grumbling] It's like, get me home! Josh was having
a hard time today, and sometimes you have to
be the one to continue pulling your partner along
when they're having a bad day. So Josh is still sleeping, but I decided to make him
breakfast this morning because Josh was just
feeling really down. For you! Whoa! You made a heart
out of bacon and eggs? Yeah. - Wow. A heart?
- Mhm. Friendship? Friendship. Part of me is wondering what that meant.
tryna figure that out. Like, you don’t just make someone
breakfast in bed. Josh was so confused and desperate
to understand Suzie's gesture that he did something so drastic,
so unthinkable. I mean, the one thing that he hated most
in the entire world… I guess I'm gonna have to read
“The Man's Guide to Women.” “When it comes to
the intricate dance that men and women do
when they're attracted to each other, the women are in control.
Their actions were often subtle. All were definitive signals that a woman
was interested and approachable.” While Josh was wondering
what was behind Suzie's act of kindness, Suzie was wondering
what was behind the Mystery Door. I can't see anything.
What if it's a little Tessy? Maybe we should make Jimmy
some banana bread. Good job.
I'm proud of you. Thanks. Thanks? - Bye.
- What? Can't wait for the chapter
of my “Men's Guide to Women” to explain what that was. The book says if she wants you,
these are the signals: Direct eye contact,
a smile, repeatedly glancing at you. Here's my guess… She likes me. Is that the ring from me? Yeah. You still wear it? Every once in a while. I never was able to throw away
a single thing from our relationship. One thing in particular,
I had to sell. What do you mean? The night before we leave here
is when I’ll tell you. I don't think I ever told her.
I was too scared. He kept most of the stuff
from when we dated, except something that he's been holding
from me this whole time. Let's just say there's a big reason
it's a secret. I gotta say,
I'm dying to know that secret. If there's anything keeping me here
‘til the end of this challenge, it's that information. It's day 20, and it's time
to spice things up a little bit. Happy day 20! How's it goin’? In front of you are five ways
you can open this Mystery Door. - Ooh!
- Oh my gosh. Now, here's the thing:
I'll be going from right to left, revealing an offer
under each platter. If you say yes to an offer, whatever's behind
the Mystery Door is yours. If you say no, only then
does the next offer get revealed. But just remember, you might be saying no
to the best deal on the table. Oh, that's messed up! Option #1, you pay $50,000. They hope that I take this one
'cause I'm all nervous. - What do you think?
- I think we say no to this. Ok. Offer #2, $100,000 out
of your prize pool. Ugh! It's probably the last platter
that's better. I think we get rid
of this again. The third offer… Ooh! Minus 25,000,
and your chain goes to 5 feet. This is how close you'll be. You still have 10 days left
in this challenge. Oh, God. Oh… If they say no,
they only have two offers left. Oh, this is hard! If they say yes, they will win
whatever's behind that question mark. Before you make a decision, do you remember
the last video you were in, where you said no to the mystery box
and a Tesla? Yep. What do you think
is behind that door? I have no idea. I can't see anything. Put your head on the ground. What if it's a little Tessy? I just wanna see the door! Let's take this…
for you. - Yes.
- Yeah, we'll take this one. Alright, they have officially
accepted the offer! My next offer was minus 25,000,
but your chain stays the same length. The final offer… Free. It's ok. They shrunk their chain to 5 feet,
they paid 25,000… What if they put two Teslas? Tesla, Tesla, Tesla… Teslas! You both won brand new Teslas! [screaming] Jimmy!! Come on in! I’m actually gonna cry! I know it's just a car,
but I’m actually so grateful! This is a $40,000 car. - Can I give you a hug?
- Of course. Oh, watch out for Josh. It's like a redemption arc! Exactly. I'm so excited!! She's excited. I'm excited because we just launched
our brand new creation for Feastables: Sour Strike Gummies! I literally can't believe this. Absolutely insane. They have no artificial dyes
or sweeteners. Just clean, high quality ingredients. I literally feel like I'm in a dream! Sour Strike Gummies
are now available at Target, 7-Eleven,
and Speedway locations nationwide. This is the best day
of my life! But don't forget these Teslas
do come at a cost. Let's see how the bathroom works
now that their chain is only 5 feet. Alright. Go to the shower. Alright. Oh! This chain can't get shorter. Oh… it can. We made you a Feastables banana bread. That actually looks good. I think the best way to wash this down
is with some Feastables chocolate milk now available in all these retailers
you see on screen. It tastes phenomenal.
Has 13 grams of protein. It’s in stores now.
Go try the new Feastables chocolate milk. I'll see you in 5 days
to shrink your chain again. - Great.
- Wow. Can’t wait. I look forward to it. Oh. See you guys. Good morning. Ok, gentle movements. I can't even wash my hands. Suzie and I have discovered
the fun reality that a 5 foot chain sucks. This chain is really annoying.
I can't even bring my hand up. Yeah it's pissing me off. [groaning] [groaning] Yeah, right.
You're gonna sit down. This 5-foot chain does not allow us to do
two different tasks at the same time. - Ow!
- Ah! [groaning] This is gonna get old real fast. - Hey!
- I need the chain! Bro! It doesn’t reach
in the shower. And that's my new reality. As he patiently waited
outside the bathroom, his mind wandered back
to the book. ""Be a gentleman.
Pull out her chair…"" Which inspired a change in his behavior
throughout the day. ""Open doors. Put the woman
at the center of any conversation…"" What's the name
of your car right now? It's Suzie. ""Briefly touch her forearm
when you ask her to dance… ""Ask open ended questions…"" What the heck are we gonna do
when we get out of here? I don’t know. We're gonna wanna just be
handcuffed again. [laughing] But it was the final chapter that focused
on their key issue. If you don't plan a date
that makes her feel special and important. That's where I completely screwed
my entire relationship. I had to be sharing with you
the smallest of expectations. Like we haven't gone
on a date in 3 months. I didn't continue planning dates
that made her feel special and important, and I didn't pay attention
to what she wanted. I think she wants a date. So when Josh asked to speak to a producer
in private about a date, I knew I had to make it happen. Aw! You do look handsome. Yeah. You look really beautiful. Thanks. We got candles.
They got real candles. You did good. I gotta admit. Aw, this is so nice. Please have a seat. Thank you, sir. I kinda like this,
like being on a date. We are emotionally getting closer again. It’s true. I think it's scary 'cause
how it ended the first time. I think this is a step
in the right direction though. Can I take you on a real date
when we leave? Like, outside of here? Yeah. Yeah. I'd love to go on an actual date. Ok. Wanna cheers with
our Feastables chocolate milk? Cheers. To our MrBeast date. Yes. This has been a good time
to reconcile. Like is there makeup anywhere? Kind of figure out
the other person again. No. Hi. Hi. The idea of him intrigues me. I'm glad to just have a date
for the first time in 3 years. It was probably one of the most fun days
that we've had in here. Perfect end to our date. I'm feeling real nervous 'cause
I don't know what is gonna come next. It's day 25. Oh gosh. We're about to fundamentally change
this entire video and the change is
under this platter. Yeah, I hate this.
My heart is beating. Reveal what's under the platter. That's all you. I brought each of you the keys
to your handcuffs. Up until this point, unhandcuffing yourself meant
you'd both lose. And if at any point between now
and the end of the video you take your handcuff off, you actually get all $250,000
and both Teslas. [laughing] Grab your key. Grab your key. If you take your handcuff off,
you get everything and the other person gets $0. Are you gonna do it? I'm actually scared now.
I'm gonna always be on edge. I thought I was going to be like
a foot away from you. Oh and on top of this,
every single day going forward we are shrinking your chain
by a foot. Oh. Oh. On day 30, you two will be
this far apart. Oh, gosh. But you don't have to do that. Because now you can take the handcuffs off
at any point. That's crazy. This is wild, actually. You probably wanna know
what's truly going on in his mind. And you probably wanna know
what's truly going on in her mind. Bring in the lie detector. Are you kidding me? Nope. We brought in
a lie detecting professional. One of you might be
taking the handcuffs off. This is where the video gets fun. Josh, you are up first
in the hot seat. We combed through your vlog footage
and crafted questions that will really help her decide if she should stick it out in this video
or leave today. - Whenever you're ready.
- Ok. Have you ever doubted
my loyalty to you? No. Even though she broke up with you? No. True. Wow. He really trusts you. Whoa! Right. Brace yourself. Yeah, right. Since being here, have you thought
you might be better off single? No. - No?
- No. Really? - Oh, great.
- Uh oh. We're not giving you that one, buddy. That's literally a Mount Everest
on the graph. So it's a lie? It is a lie. Oh, ok. Let's keep going!
The questions get better as we go! Would you steal the entire $250,000? I don't think so. Yeah, you reacted a little bit
to that one. You wanna think about that one? Mmm. We just need a yes or no. No. Is he telling the truth? I wouldn't give it
to him completely. No. If there were no hard feelings… Of course there’d be hard feelings! Does that make you wanna
take your chain off? It makes me question it more. How do you feel now that
you got some hard hitting answers? Maybe a little bit scared. But then it was Josh's turn
to ask Suzie some questions. Josh, are you ready? I'm ready. Have you hidden something
from me you knew would hurt? Yeah. True. If you knew, like, how close I got
with someone else while we were not together. Ok. Something to talk about. I get a vibe you don't wanna talk
about it now? Nope. Ok. Next question. Do you believe that
I hold you back in any way? Yes. - True.
- The future outside of here… it's just hard to tell. Ok? It's hard to see that fully
in this moment. In your perfect future.
am I in it? Yes. True. It's funny how the answers
don't coincide. You wanna elaborate on that? In a perfect future, I'm in it. Yet I still hold you back. So your perfect future,
I'm holding you back? I feel like you’d have to show me
how it is to, you know, date again. And what that would look like. We're getting some
interesting answers over here. You have her hooked up.
Anything you wanna know about her? Are you gonna unchain yourself? No. True. Did you stop loving me? No. True. Josh is taking full advantage
of this moment! Boom! Alright, maybe we un-hook her.
Josh is-- Yeah he’s grilling me! Alright, now you guys have a lot of things
you need to discuss. Oh, gosh. I'll see you tomorrow
to shrink the chain. The lie detector was pretty crazy. I think the one that I was like, “What?” was the one that you said yes to
with taking the money. I mean, it's just an honest thing. Like, Suzie already won
like 200 grand. So what? I'm still in here
putting in the same amount. No, I know.
It's just a thought, like take it. Let's get outta here quicker. Today, we were given a gift. I could literally leave this room
with all the money. She broke up with me
in the first place. That’d be the perfect revenge story! Hi! It’s day 26! - Bro.
- Hi! - A 4-foot chain?
- 4-foot chain! We actually have
another surprise for you. Oh. Oh wow. What is this? This is a soundproof box. You guys are gonna be able to talk
and say how you really feel. And the other person
will not be able to hear you. Josh, let's have you go first. Oh, alright.
Should I pull the chain? Bro! Josh? Ok! After last night Suzie,
how are you feeling? It was tough in a way. When he said that he would
take the money if he had hard feelings
about the relationship and the whole breakup still, maybe he wants revenge
in some way. Something else that
I've been thinking about has been the option
to take my cuff off right now. He was quick to say,
yeah, he would take it as if he deserves it more
or something. Alright, Suzie, your turn. - Bye!
- Bye, bye [unintelligible] We are only a few days out
from the end of this challenge, and Josh still hasn't told me
this big secret that he's been talking about. You don't plan on walking outta here
with 250 grand? It's a good question. Josh might literally steal
the entire $250,000 prize pool. Well if he does, Current would be the perfect place
to deposit all that money! I could live without working
for 2 years, 3 years. Nolan, would you like the ability
to get up to $750 of your next paycheck
in advance? - Yes.
- Then you should download Current! Do you want help
building your credit score? - Yes.
- Then you should download Current! I'm downloading it, Jimmy. If you use this QR code or
the link in description: Current.com/beast and download Current right now, I will personally deposit $1
into your banking account. I wish I could just keep doing that. I've already given away hundreds
of thousands of dollars through Current over the last 4 years. Current can help you
with all your money needs. It's the #1 banking app
for your paycheck. It's probably what I will do. Get this, if Josh steals the prize pool and you guys download Current
and use code Beast, you will technically make more money
off this video than Suzie will, and you didn't have to spend
30 days in a room. So download Current right now,
there's never been a better time. I'll send you $1 right now. Download Current
and I will pay you to do it! It's the best place
for your paycheck. Alright guys, we're gonna leave
this box in here for a little bit of privacy
while we're gone. Bye guys, we’ll see you tomorrow. - Oh no.
- Alright. The short chain was clearly
getting to them, as both of them had a lot
on their mind. I'm really trying to be patient. Suzanne, you’re slow,
and it pisses me off sometimes. I am a little bit annoyed right now. Josh keeps making me
do the activity he wants to do by literally picking me up
and dragging me there. This isn't very nice. Good morning! Day 27. - From 4 feet--
- To 3 feet! The fact that I can’t do anything in here without Josh literally hovering over me
at all times is driving me crazy. Oh my God! Josh! Stop that!
Josh, let me out! Why are we in the kitchen? - Are you done?
- I am now! - This man--
- I need water! Are you serious? I’m sorry. I just needed something to drink! So annoying, bro. Day 28! Ooh what?
That's so short! Let me tell you right now,
this 2 feet is tough to deal with. A little bump in the kitchen used to be,
""Oh sorry, my bad."" And now it's like every single little bump
makes me wanna leave. I just wanna get out of here. That has nothing to do with
what we were saying anyway. I could just leave! Josh today randomly brought up
this thing where he said, ""Oh, I can just leave at any time."" He kind of made me a little concerned that
he's just gonna walk out at any point. 24 hours remain!
How you doing?! - Let’s go!
- Woo! Yay! What's life been like
with the short chain? Pretty rough. Yeah, sleep was awful last night. Before we shrink down to a foot… Josh, I don't know if
this is the time to tell Suzie, if there's something
you wanna bring up? One thing in particular
I had to sell… Tell me! Ok, so the last 8 months of us dating… Ok. I was saving for an engagement ring,
that I ended up buying. But my plan was on your family vacation,
I was gonna propose under the waterfall. Are you serious? And we broke up
before that happened. That makes me wanna cry. When we broke up, I sold the ring
and I bought a motorcycle. Oh! [laughs] I actually don't know what to say.
You had an engagement ring for me? Yeah. I'm sorry. It's ok. I mean, he got a motorcycle out of it. I got a motorcycle out of it. Exactly. Oh my God. This is a 1-foot chain. - And lastly…
- Oh let's go! This is exactly how much time
you have left. Yay! Well, have fun. Bye. It has been a day today. I finally found out
the secret from Josh. It was that he had an engagement ring
sitting there waiting for me at home! Now I know that his heart was
in the right place the whole time. I do see that future with Josh again. Alright, let's sleep
by the money tonight, shall we? Waah! Nice! 12 hours and 43 minutes.
How does it make you feel? I think overall, the experience
has been amazing. I’m probably more so dying
to get out of here. I am scared for the next 24 hours. On the lie detector he asked me if
I would take my cuff off early, and I said no. True. But I never got that
true answer from him. So I have been scared the last few days
that he might actually take his cuff off. Am I gonna take my cuff off? Well, it is a lot of money. $250,000 would be more so life changing
than say half of that. When we broke up for a very long time,
I felt very lost and alone. I think it'd be fair for me
to take the money from her. We have the best view
in the world tonight! Our countdown clock. So if we get a full
12 hours of sleep, we'll wake up with 17 minutes
until Jimmy arrives. - You know what I've been thinking about?
- What? Remember like 3 years ago
when you broke up with me? Yes. And we like didn't talk
for 3 years… Mhm. Because I could literally just
take all the money and then we wouldn't talk
ever again. Bro! I'm just saying! Three seconds on the clock. If Josh unchains himself
before the time runs out, he wins the entire $250,000
and both of the Teslas. Ten minutes left on the timer!
Let's see if someone steals everything. How's it going?! Oh God, I’m nervous! It's actually time.
It feels fake. Suzie this could be your 125 grand,
Josh that could be your 125 grand. Unless, one of you
takes the handcuffs off. And just a reminder, this is what you said
during the lie detector. Do you believe that
I hold you back in any way? - Yes.
- True. Would you steal the entire $250,000? I don't think so. You reacted a little bit
to that one. A minute and 12 seconds. This is your last chance
to steal the money! - Are you going to?
- It’s the ultimate revenge. Oh my gosh.
Is Josh playing the long game? Stop! Are you going to?! 16 seconds, you sure? Nah, he deserves half of it. I might deserve all of it. Woah! Josh! Is there anything you'd wanna say to Suzie
for when this video airs? I never fully stopped loving you
after we broke up. And I carried that with me
everywhere I went. There was so much love left over
for her in my heart that I couldn't move on
and allow myself to love someone else. Can I take you on a real date
when we leave? Yeah! Ok. It's a date. Ok. Nah, he’s messing!
That looks like a guy who’s messing. I'm not gonna do it. 3, 2, 1… Time is up! Alright! I don't need that thing anymore!
You are now free. Oh my gosh! Here's your $125,000! Suzie, Josh, what's next
for the two of you? Oh! Oh woah!
I was not expecting that! Ok! Looks like they're happy now! I hope you guys enjoyed. Subscribe.",unknown

_AbFXuGDRTs,"Hidden in this mountain is
a $1 billion nuclear bunker. We are 2,000 feet underground
inside of a mountain, and it can survive the biggest
atomic bombs ever made. And I'm gonna show you the difference
between this $50 million nuclear bunker, this $30 million bunker,
and everything in between. Starting with this $1 bunker. Feels safe. Let's see what's inside. Oh, it's wet. I'm gonna give you guys
a tour of this bunker. The tour's over. It's basically a shipping container
buried underground And already bending. Which would explain
why they sold it to me for $1. I mean, it looks like it's already
after the explosion. Do you think this bunker
would survive a bomb? - No.
- Let's find out. Drop the bomb! Wait. What? The bunkers get crazier as we go,
let’s head to the next one. Next is the $1 million bunker. It was originally built to shoot missiles, survive a nuclear apocalypse
far underground. But how do you even
get inside it? Well, after descending countless stairs
and opening a 7,000 pound door… Why is 7,000 pounds
so heavy? you reach the heart
of the bunker. Oh my God. This kind of looks
like Star Wars. This room is where they would
launch the missile from. This whole facility is designed to
withstand a nuclear attack and then respond. The floor we're standing on
is actually suspended like a giant platform hanging
from the ceiling above. These 8 springs are the only thing
holding all of us up right now. It's crazy to believe that
50 years ago, this used to be like
a missile command center. But now this man has turned it into
a hidden, fortified house that's ready for
the end of the world. How did the government
let you buy this? Dude there’s a bath tub! How's the IQ of my friends
compared to your normal guests? Um… I think it's lower. We're gonna go 2 floors down.
This is the lowest point. We are now 5 stories underground. So kitchen, entertainment area,
but the best part about this? This is a club. This guy actually throws parties
5 stories underground that Nolan is probably
not invited to. So I don't normally
show people this. Like, no one
sees this. But he actually took us to
a secret part of the bunker, to the nuclear silo where decades ago,
a real nuclear missile was stored inside. No. Jimmy, come in here. Whoa, wait.
What is this? - Is that safe over there?
- Uh, no. Wait, no Karl.
He said it's not s-- How bad would it be
if we turned the lights off? I mean, I actually
don't know how we-- - Oh, dude.
- This is really scary. I can't even see anything. What's crazy is we're just
getting started. The bunkers later in this video
are insane. They just keep getting bigger and
more and more expensive. But if you were going to try
to build one yourself, it might look like the one
in this backyard. Secretly hidden beneath our feet
is a bunker worth $3 million. Follow me to
this creepy shed. Going into a bunker someone
built in their backyard. This is crazy. This is awesome. In terms of security, you've got like
a meter of concrete above you. Other than a safe house, it is kind of
a museum for my YouTube creations. If you're wondering why
this bunker is worth $3 million, it's because of this YouTuber's collection
of insane and dangerous weapons. That's a backpack flamethrower. This guy's like
a real life Tony Stark. I mean, look at this wrist-mounted
rocket launcher. It fires knives and
has a taser in it. And a machine gun
with a chainsaw. Oh my gosh,
this is crazy. Don't break into
this bunker. He did mention fire earlier, so… - Oh, gosh. Wait.
- No way. Bro, we're in a bunker! You come here. Ok. Now you can-- Oh my gosh. I don't know if
I feel safe with this.  This is terrifying. You're gonna burn
your bunker down. Do you want a go? Yes. Oh my God. This is insane. This guy is crazy. This would be the worst bunker
in the world to rob. Well, it's not just this bunker.
There is another room. Oh, what do you mean? I think this guy really likes
digging holes. He has like a literal underground
tunneling system. Whoa, wait this one's bigger
than the other bunker. And there's one invention in here that's
so dangerous we saved it for last. Just in case. I'm gonna go over here. But first, Colin showed me a cannon
that turns anything into ammunition. I mean, we’ve got bread rolls
at the moment. Here it comes. Ok, just do it. I'm about to do it. Get it over with! - About to happen.
- I'm terrified! Any second,
he’s gonna shoot it. Just go. This is awesome. The whole toilet roll? The whole point of a bunker
is to protect you. But I can't say I felt safe
once Colin pulled this out. This is my spinning belt of knives.
Don't get too close. Oh my gosh. Especially after
he started doing this. Have you ever had
a knife fall off? No. Alright.
Turn it off. You could do that without
having a spinning belt of knives. Yeah, but this is so much better. Now Jimmy,
check this out. This is a freezer-wave,
the opposite to a microwave. So we get some Feastables,
we shove that in there, we've got this little thing. He couldn't wait to show us how it worked
on some Feastables Cups. Done. Nothing is what it seems. Oh my gosh.
Frozen Feastables. - That's cool. Right?
- Yeah. Well, literally. But as safe as Colin feels there's no chance it compares
to this island paradise, $5 million presidential bunker. Why does it smell
like cat pee? It may not look like much, but in 1961, it was
more than enough for one of the United States'
most well known presidents, JFK. Oh my gosh. What? You're telling me that JFK
only had this? But yeah, now it's kind of a dump. These are the presidential bathrooms. You're telling me five mil. But more impressive, we've got
a billion dollar bunker so secure that it's the only place you could survive
a nuclear extinction. This is not very big. I hope JFK never sees this video 'cause he's going to be like pretty upset
at all the other cool bunkers. I have a feeling he won't. Now let's go from the bunker of the past
to the bunker of the future. Welcome to the $30 million bunker. This is a 15 story bunker. It's basically an underground skyscraper, and it's built for 75 people
to survive anything. First of all, these are
armor plated steel doors. The doors are 2 feet thick. How many RPGs would it take
to blow through this door? Probably 3. And if that doesn't make you feel safe,
there's a sniper's nest on the roof, 24 hour security,
and Larry's favorite… Guns. Oh my gosh. So you're ready for
an invasion! We aren’t gonna let people
steal our food. Can I hold one? This bunker also has its own
indoor shooting range. This is insane. Maybe this is all overkill, but if the world was really about to end,
who wouldn't wanna live here? This bunker has a hospital,
an exam room, a dentist office,
a pharmacy. This is jail! And 15 luxury apartments,
which we've actually seen before. Dude, I remember. Five years ago, we filmed a video
where we did 24 hours in this bunker. We looked so different. I was younger. This apartment
15 floors underground is nicer than most people's
not bunker apartments. Washer dryer.
This is awesome. And all the other amenities
on the other 14 floors. Don't tell Chandler and them
'cause he might get jealous, but I think we'll buy
one of these. - Yo, Jimmy.
- Oh, what's up? Hey. - I saw there's like another--
- Yo, can you go check out over there? There’s enough rooms
for all of us to-- Can you guys check that? I'll take this room, yeah?
Jimmy I'll take this room. And if you're wondering
what they eat down here. This is our grocery store. You really want this to feel like
real life, this is crazy. Y'all got bacon in a can? What kind of bunker would be
if we didn’t have bacon? In a can? And if you don't want to try
bacon in a can. This is the entrance to
the hydroponics. Wow. This is probably one of the most
important rooms in this bunker. Instead of dirt, hydroponics use water
to grow a variety of plants that would essentially produce
infinite food for the residents. And finally, we made it to
what could be the most protected pool
in the entire world. Oh my gosh. I'm gonna be honest, this bunker is
at least 20 times better than every bunker
we visited so far. It had a pool, infinite food, a gym,
and even an entire rock wall. I don't know how it's gonna
get better than this, but somehow there are
more expensive bunkers. Let's go check 'em out. And now the $50 million bunker which is underneath this ordinary house
in this ordinary neighborhood. But if you look
30 feet underground, you'll find one of the most expensive
and most bizarre bunkers on the planet. Let's go explore it. Inside here,
it's just a normal house. But there's a secret code
to open up the elevator. Blur this because I'll get in
trouble if it shows it. Ok. One, two, three… And the elevator opens up. Alright, you guys ready? Now we're going
3 stories underground. If you turn around,
you can literally see the-- You can see! This is like all the stone and cement
we're going down. That’s so cool. This elevator takes forever. Ok. And--
Oh my gosh. How’d they fit all that
in here? This is crazy. This $50 million bunker is designed
to look like you're not in a bunker. Dude, hey,
feel this carpet. Is this carpet or grass? I don't know,
but it feels great. If you're forced to be trapped
in a bunker for 100 years this is probably the bunker
you would choose because it doesn't
feel like one. It looks like you're outside. They got palm trees
3 stories underground. They have a Christmas tree. Even though Christmas was
9 months ago. I guess they just
leave it up all year. Let's kick this bunker tour off
by exploring the house that is in a bunker
underneath. Watch out! Oh my God. The guy who built this bunker
is like 5 feet tall. Wait, Tareq,
walk under it. I'm good. No, that's not a flex. You're short! Oh my God.
What is this place? Whoa! This is huge. This is way bigger than
I thought it would be. This is so fancy. It does not feel like
you're in a bunker. No, I feel like
I'm in a normal house. Obviously, this bunker was
designed in a way where if you had to live down here
for decades, you wouldn't miss the outside world
because it feels like the outside world. Bro it literally looks like you're outside
with the trees in the window. Surely if you're own a $50 million bunker,
you wouldn't care if I took a Diet Coke. Wait how old is this? Oh, God. Um… Yo. Yo, wait. This expired 2 years ago. It tasted so bad. Hey, Google if I'm gonna die. Yeah, I'm not getting anything. Yeah, it's 'cause we’re
3 stories underground. - Whoa!
- Yeah. Where is this? Bro. Yeah, this is it.
This is the room. Wait, is this the video where we trapped
Hugo and Rayne in a bunker for 100 days to win $500,000? What do you guys think
of Hugo and Rayne? - They always fight.
- I like ‘em. What if I told you… that was a signal for them
to come down the elevator, and they're probably gonna be mad
this bunker's way nicer than the one
I put 'em, in. What the heck? Welcome to the $50 million bunker! - Hey, guys.
- What the-- What do you think? This is a bunker? This is nicer than the bunker
I built you guys. - I'm sorry.
- Yeah. And don't drink the diet Coke,
it expired 2 years ago. Have fun! Yes! Don't fight. Don't disrespect me like that! You’re so stupid. We won't fight. We're watching your bunker video
in a bunker, in a house in the bunker
below another house. How does that make you feel? What did you just say? Don't worry about it.
Let's keep going. It didn't take long for Hugo and Rayne
to fall back into old habits. It's all pink! Hugo, I promise, if this was
our kitchen in the bunker, I would have cooked
for you every night! It is nice, but I still don't think
you woulda cooked. No-- Oh my God. Outside this house is a pool! We're still in a bunker,
keep in mind. Hugo! Oh! He just jumped in
with socks on. So far, my only critique
of this bunker: The pool can use some heat.
It’s pretty cold. How different would your challenge
have been if you guys had a pool? - Very different.
- I don’t think I would've left. And to make this bunker even better…. You guys loved our
peanut butter cups so much that we decided to make
an alternative version with hazelnut. They're only available for a limited time
at these select retailers, so go try some
before they're gone. And if you haven't already,
try our peanut butter cups and tell us which
you like more. They taste amazing. And obviously, it wouldn't be
a hidden bunker without its own secret escape route. That's the secret exit.
Not sure if I'm supposed to show it. And that brings us to last,
but not least, the $1 billion dollar bunker,
the most secure bunker on the planet! The Cheyenne Mountain Space Force Station. This bunker is shielded by over
2,000 feet of solid granite rock, and can literally withstand
the most destructive weapons ever devised by mankind. What happens if we run down this tunnel? Don't ask him. They'll shoot you. Oh. I won't run down
the tunnel then. Alright, let's do this. Now, usually this is where
we'd have a fancy 3D map showing just exactly how
this bunker is laid out. However, this place is so secretive
and secure… I need you to put a lens cap
on this camera. I legally cannot show anything
like that from here on out. And if somehow,
you make it past the guards… Can I hold your gun?
Or no? - No, you cannot.
- Ok, alright. Karl-- don't ask that. Wait, can I hold it? You'll reach this massive
nuclear bomb-proof door. Durable enough to protect you from the biggest and
deadliest bombs ever created. Whoa! Wait, there's 2? And if all of that somehow wasn't enough, there's a second one
right on the other side. If someone blew up a nuke out there,
and we were here… We would be good. So this is what we call
the welcome wall. This is going in
to the compound now. Does that say Space Force? It does. You have Space Force here. These are the 4 commands that operate
outside of this bunker. And to ensure complete safety for
these elite world leaders, this bunker’s also designed to survive
something far less predictable than any enemy threat:
mother nature. And it does so
by literally floating. They carved out a gap between
the mountain and the bunker, and then put the bunker
on springs so the shockwave of a nuclear attack or
even an earthquake is completely absorbed. Welcome to the most secure bunker
on the planet. Alright. We've gone through massive blast doors,
walked for an eternity… I can't even tell you how far
because it's classified to get here, the most secure place
on the planet. Let's see what's inside. And now, we are at the what? The battle deck. Am I allowed to show all this? Everything except for
what's on the right. That's definitely not a UFO. But to protect North America from
an airborne or maritime attack, this is where the leaders of NORAD
would be calling the shots. This is where
our General sits. Oh, this felt like
the General seat. - Can I sit in the General seat?
- Absolutely. Go ahead. Just don't touch anything! Uh, I touched the chair.
Is that fine? - That's it.
- Ok. I'm the General now! Tareq, ready the systems. Yeah… sure. No! Did you actually
touch something? You're not supposed to touch it! - Don't touch anything.
- I didn't-- Tareq, they've only told us like 30 times
not to touch anything. We gotta make sure
for real. Dude! He’s gonna
get arrested! Oh my God, I'm so sorry.
I am actually so sorry. Tareq might have literally just
got us kicked out. Don't touch it again. - Ok. I'm so sorry.
- Please don't do that. I'm so, so sorry. Tareq, these buttons could launch
missiles for all you know. What's on the other side
of those windows? You wanna clap? No way. Really?
I just clap? Yup. - Yo!
- Stop it! Eric showed us the secret command post
at the heart of the bunker. Alright, where am I? You're in the AJOC. Alternate Joint Operation Center. And it's responsible for protecting
the air and sea of the entire North American continent. With an unknown aircraft, how many minutes
until fighter jets are tailing them? Less than 5 minutes. Then we're getting into
some dangerous territory. I can read between the lines. And because they're monitoring
every potential threat, you know I had to ask… Any UFOs? Uh, possibly?
You can't answer? He’s lookin' at the ground.
Oh, nevermind. - Different subject.
- Cut it there! So, I finally got permission
to film a hallway. Take it all in! Now I need you to put
the lens cap back on, Jimmy. Really? Alright, I'll see you guys
in the next room. While the number of people that
work here is classified, I can tell you it has everything needed
to keep hundreds of people alive for years at a time, including a gym,
a grocery store… Wait, so many people work in this bunker
that you opened a Subway? Correct. I'm about to have the most secure
meatball marinara I've ever had. It also has its own fire station. Yes, with fire trucks that drive on
actual roads inside this mountain. Alright, hold up.
Oh, let's not run with that. - No running with that.
- Alright. I got you. They usually practice on dummies, but we brought one of our own. They better save me. - He's unconscious!
- Slap him in the face! - Get him up!
- Wake up! Sorry. - Lift me up!
- Hurry! Sir, how would you say we did? Uh, probably a 4/10. That's 'cause we didn't
do enough CPR! More! Wait! I'm good! Some bunkers hide in backyards. And with enough money,
hide under entire neighborhoods. Others go beyond survival
and are so luxurious that they have their own water park. But none compare to this: an underground city
with its own power grid, endless hallways, highways,
and multiple lakes. This bunker one day could be what
defends North America and humanity. One last thing I need you to do.

TDv56whosPQ,"I built this maximum
security prison, and if this cop and this criminal
survive 100 days together, I will give them
half a million dollars. - What's going on?
- Nice to officially meet you. - Nice to meet you. Lenny.
- Ian. You guys want to be
uncuffed? That'd be great. Now that that's
out the way… At any point over the next 100 days, if either of you decide to leave,
you’ll both get nothing. Have you guys ever seen
$500,000 in real life? Never. Well, I owed a half a million
when I got out of prison. Does that count? How long were
you a cop? 17 years. How long were you a… …criminal? 3 years in
federal prison. How do these compare
to the prison you were in? These are a little thicker.
And we have a pillow. You didn't get a pillow
when you're in prison? They don't give you
a pillow. Well aside from the pillow,
this prison is a 1:1 replica of what an actual prison
would be like. Dude, he's got
the real prison toilet. Wow. We’re gonna feed you guys
3 times a day, we’re gonna cut the lights off
at the same time every night, and we’re gonna give you
a wake-up call every morning. Good luck. They really made this like prison. These seats are cold. - Uncomfortable!
- Cold. Hard. As always, we have a ton of cameras
monitoring their every move. They're listening to everything
that we're saying, so anything that
we say… They're gonna get ideas. Today was the first time that this
cop and this criminal have ever met. And we didn't know it yet,
but over the course of this video, Ian and Lenny quickly
became enemies. There's gonna be stealing… I'm now the smuggling convict. Fights… So because I'm not religious,
it's an issue. Whoa, I didn’t say that. We're gonna need
an EMT! And even betrayal. You’re Lenny, the snitch. This is brutal. Will they make it the entire 100 days
or will one of them screw the other? All I want to do is go home
with all the money, and if I have to strangle a cop,
so be it. - Dibs on bottom bunk.
- Nah, I'm taking the bottom bunk. Whatever, old man. In prison, it goes by
the elder respect. So whoever's older
gets to decide first. What if he snores
at night? I do. Good night. Hey, what about a warning? All right, criminal.
Get some rest. Good morning. It is way too early. The stupid cop
was snoring all night. Your snoring kept me up. - It did?
- Yeah. So I think it's like,
judging by the sky, like maybe 6 or 7 a.m.
right now? The first night. Jimmy, I gotta say,
that really did feel like prison. The most important question:
What were you locked up for? Fraud and
money laundering. So I start lying, borrowing money
from this person to pay this person, lost everyone's money. But the problem became
I lied about the losses. So I ended up with
$500,000 of debt… Which coincidentally is
the same amount of money they could win
in this video. Meal time. Guys, we got our first meal
in prison right here. This actually looks
better than prison. Ian the criminal seems to be
right at home here. It's actually pretty cozy
down here. While Lenny the cop is fighting
to adapt to prison life. I've locked people up
my whole life, so it's weird to be
on the other end of it. Them telling me what time
I gotta go to sleep, what time I’m gonna be waking up,
and what time I'm going to be eating. Like, that’s a wild, crazy
adjustment for me. Good morning. Ian and Lenny’s relationship was off
to a bit of a rocky start. I think I might sleep
on the floor for the snoring. Bro, it’s so annoying. I have officially
moved my bed, and hopefully it will deflect
Mr. Lenny's snoring. Even with the tension between them
and Ian's lack of sleep, the cop and criminal had to do
something to cure their boredom. They worked together to create a
basketball hoop with their bed frame… This is a dope idea. And even utilized it
as a pull up bar. I was not athletic
my first prison go around, so I'm making it up
my second one. There we go. It was clear that they wanted
some workout equipment. I'm tryna turn a jail body
into a beach body. And as usual, I had something
for them on day 10 that might help
them out. Officer Beast reporting. Officer Beast reporting for duty! Let's see how our prisoners
are doing. How's it going, boys? Warden Jimmy! I see you dismantled
the bed here. Well, I'm living
with Snorlax over here. Snorlax?
What, you snore? Apparently,
but I don't believe it. What do you think
the day 10 offer is? - Personal chef, a library…
- A book. What if it was none
of the above? Follow me, boys. This locked door is the first
of many restricted areas that I will reveal throughout
the course of this video. Guards! Unlock the door. East wing unlocked. Right this way. Welcome to
the prison yard! Out here, you'll have
everything you need to stay fit for
the next 90 days. Let's go. For 1 hour a day you'll have access
to a pull-up bar, a basketball goal. Just soak it in. This would make time go by
so much faster. Oh, it feels great
seeing the sun. Are you ready
to hear the offer? - Yes, we are.
- Yes. Alright, come on in. Unlock the interrogation room. Area unlocked. Alright, come on in.
Have a seat. Alright. Now that you're in
separate rooms with no ability to communicate
with each other, the day 10 offer is… If you guys want
the recreational area, it's gonna cost you $50,000
of your prize pool. If you both accept it,
it's yours for 50 grand. But where this gets
interesting is if one of you accept it
and the other doesn’t, you still pay the 50 grand
for the prize pool, but only one of you gets access to it
for the rest of the video. This is not what
I was expecting. You've had 10 days in this prison
to get to know each other, but can you predict what
the other person will choose? Oh, my goodness… It's a big decision because
this affects the next 90 days. I'm tired of lookin’ like
the bad guy in life. You know what
the good guy would do, but being the good guy
for 90 days kinda sucks. I wanna cry. Alright, you've both
made your decisions. They have no idea what
each other chose. Want to kick us off? I said yes. I haven't told him what you chose yet. I said yes. My view on the money aspect
has changed drastically. I'm willing to spend money
to live more comfortably, to get through
this time here. Who knows? You might not
make it to the end if we pass up the things that could
make our situation more comfortable. Some money is better
than no money. That's the way that
I see it. Good morning. Good morning. It was crazy to see that
an hour a day of recreation time made them feel like they could
stay here for 100 days. Wow. Freedom, baby. Definitely worth the 50K. 50 grand well spent. Over the next
couple of days, they took full advantage
of everything the yard had to offer. Gonna come out of here
looking like savages. For now, it seemed like
the rec yard allowed them to tolerate each other
enough to survive. But there were some things
about this challenge that they didn't handle
so well… because I built this set to be
just like a real prison. And we all know
prison food is not that good. This is Warden Jimmy’s version
of meatloaf. Like a frozen burger, probably
defrosted with some gravy on it. This food is absolute
butt cheeks. I had no idea the people
I arrested were eating this. I really don't know how much
longer I can eat this. I would not wish this upon my worst
enemy, what's goin’ on right now. And that's why, on day 20,
I had the perfect thing for them. Are you ready
for the day 20 offer? - Yes. Let's go.
- Yes. One of you is gonna have to make
the decision for both of you. Which one of you wants
to make the decision that both of you
will have to live with? Alright, I'll just let you
rock with it. Ok. Oh, really?
You trust him that much? - Course he does.
- Yeah. We talk a lot. Ok. Let's go. Kitchen unlocked. Come on in. Wow. There's a kitchen
in here? In this kitchen is all
the ingredients and cooking equipment you'll need to cook
delicious and healthy meals for the rest of your time
in this prison. You can continue eating
the prison meals which you don't like or take this kitchen
and eat whatever you want for breakfast, lunch,
and dinner every single day. You just have to give up
your yard time every day. Do you know what the offer is? It's trade the rec yard
for a kitchen. Me personally, I would rather
have the food. Could have fun cooking
throughout the day. We can make creations. Do we have any meat? Do we have any meat?
What do ya think? We got some beef patties,
some hot dogs. Everything you could want. Ok, ok. But here's the thing:
You're not just deciding for you. What do you think
your partner would think? Aw man, I don’t know what
he’d want me to do. Well, I'll give you
a minute to choose. Ian, I gave your roommate
the choice to trade the recreation yard for
a fully-stocked kitchen. I already know what he picked.
He picked keep the yard time. Yeah, he didn't even
consider my offer. Guys, every single day
you complain about the food, I thought you were
gonna take it! You know what? That was a little easier
than I thought. Day 30, I’m gonna make it
not so easy on you guys. Alright. Bye, Warden Jimmy. Not giving up this rec yard
for nothing. Another day in paradise. It's been a full 24 hours since
my bunkie and I made the decision to turn down
the kitchen. We're not feeling
the least bit of regret. - You feeling any regret over there?
- None. We're so happy we're not
cooped up all day. I can't wait to see
my wife's reaction. She's gonna be like, ain't no way that you didn't take
that basketball court. No way you didn't take
being outside. Despite being happy with
the results of their challenge, they were also beginning to think
about what they were missing outside of
the prison. What I have to remember is
why I'm here and what my purpose is. Winning that money for my family
is the ultimate goal. I got my wife.
I have a beautiful family. I can't back out of this because
everybody else is depending on me. It must be nice having
a wife and kids. Yeah, I did a year
without my family. I mean… I saw my dad once in that year
for two days. Once? But I didn't see my brother
or my mom for a year. Really? That's that. Limited to an hour of
yard time a day… Can't wait for yard time. … they grew restless and found
creative ways to pass the time before the next
challenge. Ketchup Dodgeball! Get outta here, copper! We’re gonna need an EMT. Wrap me up!
Officer, am I gonna lose it? I‘m losing breath! Our inmates have now been living
in this prison for 30 days. Let's see how they're doing.
What up, boys? - Hey!
- Hey, Warden Jimmy! Guys, you're a month into it.
How's it been? It's been good. Come on inside, fellas. There's a new area of the prison
that we're going to unlock right now. Unlock the library door. You gotta be kidding. Library unlocked. Are you serious? Seriously! And there are literally
hundreds of books in here. We got magazines. Wait, hold up. Here's the catch. Access to this library is 100% free,
but only one of you gets it. - For the next 70 days…
- You gotta be kiddin’ me. …one of you will get to go in here
for an hour and read. The other will not. Oh, for an hour every day? And you can't bring
the books out? Cannot bring the books out.
That is strictly forbidden. What else is included
in there? Alright, we'll do a tour. You have lots of
books in here. They got a Bible.
Look at this. This right here will get me through.
This the only book that I need. What's the computer about? You gotta put that back. Leave it to him to try
to steal a book. This bad boy will play
Tetris and Minesweeper. Got some more books
over here. Oh man,
this is tough. It's disrespectful. I'm gonna need you guys
to step out. I'll give you guys a couple hours
to negotiate amongst each other. Good luck deciding. - Thanks, Jimmy.
- I'm not happy with this. You guys like reading
this much? Yeah, have you ever been
locked up? No, actually. We're dying in here. Ok. I'll be back in 2 hours
for your decision. One of us always has to suffer
in MrBeast’s prison. We got to talk it out just like
we do everything else. Hopefully it doesn't come down to
me putting him in a headlock. After I left, Ian and Lenny
kind of avoided each other… This sucks. …agonizing over
my offer. It is literally so close. I'm not asking for any other books.
I just want one. We have to come up with something.
We can't just do nothing. This library, I mean,
it's meant, obviously, to pit us against
each other. So what's on your mind?
You're the philosophical one. I think that we have no choice
but to take it. Because it's a freebie.
It's too good to pass up. The question is, though,
is who takes it? Right now, I'm shooting
hoops, and… I'm still pretty happy with
the decision that we made in regards to that, so… I’m gonna put the ball
in your court because you put the ball
in my court for the last one. Oh, sorry. Trying to kill me
out here, bruh… It seemed like a fair trade
to put the library decision on Ian. But there was one thought
that Lenny just couldn't shake. I should have my Bible. With all honesty… Why do you think that you
deserve the library more than me? Just like, what I need to help get me
to 100 days, you know? You possibly wanting to cop out
as a result is… I don't know. What makes you think
you deserve the library, then? The Bible is the only thing that'll
get me through the next 70 days. It's not just for
entertainment. So because I'm not religious,
it's an issue. Whoa, I didn't say that. I just feel like you're changing up
on me out of the blue for no reason
right now. Then we just go with
no books. If that's the way
it's gotta be, bro. Alright. It’s whatever, bro. It's just really making me
second guess. Honestly, this whole thing's
getting ridiculous. Too bad you don't have
a book to distract you. I think we're ready for
the warden at this point, guys. It looked like this cop and criminal
might have landed back at square one, but nonetheless,
their time was up. Alright, I'm ready for
your decision. Is it you or is it you
that is getting library time every day for
the next 70 days? Jimmy, the thing is… Looks like I'm gonna be getting
that library time. - You are?
- Yep. You're givin’ it to him?
I was a little concerned. It's been a hard last
couple hours. Why did you
give it to him? When it came down
to the yard… I said yes… Without hesitation.
He was cool losing 25,000. That's the only thing
that he's wanted. So I had to do him
the justice. You're lucky. He's a good man.
He's a good cop. I didn't expect that
from a cop. I was wrong. I feel like that was unnecessary.
He just gave you a library. Library unlocked. It was Ian's first day with access
to the new library. And right away,
he got to work to ensure that Lenny
wouldn't be left out. I believe this is what
he was looking for. I know how important
the Bible is to Lenny. So I'm writing down quotes from it
that I can share with him. Thank you, I appreciate it.
I gotta live through you. Vicariously through me,
you know. The fact that he’s sharing, it
shows that he's a good bunkie. But no later than
the very next morning did Ian begin to test
the limits. Found a little artwork
we can hang up somewhere. Said we can't bring books out,
but I'm just smugglin’ pages out. Wow, that's pretty cool. And over the next couple days,
it wasn't just Ian having all the fun. We got some artwork. And the prison
began to change. Makin’ this place look nice. And even with cameras
aimed at them all the time, Ian's inner criminal
finally surfaced. There was no way I was gonna
leave him out there struggling with no Bible,
no books, nothin’ to do. And I was in here
enjoying myself. This thing is a beauty.
That’s all I need while I’m in here. They carried on as if
they'd never be caught… Enjoying the materials. My new name's Smuggler Vic,
the Smuggling Convict. I literally have books hidden
everywhere. Here in the bathroom.
Look at that. In here. We're just gonna keep getting
as many books as possible. Hidden all over
this place. It's day 40. How's it going, guys? We have a surprise,
but we can only take one at a time. You guys have to decide
who goes first. Rock, paper,
scissors, shoot! He got me.
He goes. Store unlocked. We've opened
our very own shop. You're gonna have some
decisions to make. We combed through all of
the prisoners’ conversations and stocked this store full of items
that they wanted. And it ranges from this mystery box,
which could literally be anything, all the way down to this handball
that on the outside would cost $1. But in this prison, every single
thing here is the same price: 10,000. A handball for $10,000? But of course, they were only allowed
to spend the money that they were
competing for. - And I have to decide now?
- Yeah. I'm gonna take the… …mystery box. $10,000. Pleasure doing business with you. And while Lenny was happy with
just the mystery box, Ian's criminal spending habits
resurfaced. Oh, wow. This is actually
pretty cool. If I spend too much money,
Lenny’s gonna get really mad. I’m a little nervous here. This is 100% gonna be
my first purchase of the day. See, the thing is, at least
he knows what he's getting. I have no clue
what’s in there. This is a great package
for 10,000. Don't buy too much, Ian. I'd like the melatonin
and the clippers. We're gonna have some
fun in here, buddy! But how much
did you spend? 30,000, but we got
Feastables. And honestly,
I am so happy right now. I got clippers for us.
I got you the sleep mask. If I really needed those things,
I would’ve spent the 10K on them. Listen, I went to prison for
spending a lot of money, so… I couldn't resist! There was just
dollar signs everywhere. Do you wanna see what's
in the mystery box? 20 grand! Come on.
He's makin' money! I think now we have enough
to keep us busy to the point where we don't need
to spend anything else. And now that the boys had
some of the items they wanted, they were able to pass time
more easily. They made art with
the $10,000 colored pencils. These are my first of
the colored ones for the walls. Feastables, the best chocolate
in the world. So excited for this. - Oh, these things are legit good.
- That's my new favorite. You guys already know, Feastables is the best tasting
chocolate in the world. And we just launched our brand new
creamy hazelnut cups. Usually cups have peanut butter
inside of them, like our Feastables
Peanut Butter Cups, but when I was
testing prototypes, and I tried creamy hazelnut chocolate
filling inside of a cup, it was phenomenal. And so we launched
this product, and the reviews have been
out of this world. It's available at these retailers.
Go give it a try. Then they made paper airplanes
with $10,000 paper. Somebody come get
this guy. A new level of
boredom. Did they ever diagnose you
with ADHD? And Lenny gave Ian the most
expensive haircut of his life. Now the guards will finally
be afraid of me. And eventually, Lenny came to
appreciate what Ian bought for him. I gotta keep it real
with you. These earplugs and
the melatonin, they definitely come through
in the clutch. Really helps me get some
extra rest. - Thanks.
- You’re welcome, buddy. But they still wanted one thing
that they couldn't buy in a store. Tomorrow's day 50,
challenge day. Hoping it's family or
a phone call. Toughest part is being away
from my family. Would you spend money
on a phone call? Yeah, I’d spend money
on a phone call. So I have the perfect offer
for day 50. Boys!
It's day 50! Before I reveal the day 50 offer,
I need to show you two some clips. Let's do it. Here's you one day,
smuggling the books into your pants. Eventually, you started
caring so little that you literally
threw the books out. And then you just flat out walked
out of there with the books. Day 50 is a huge milestone. Your families are sitting outside
in a prison bus, and we were
going to celebrate it by bringing in both of
your families for free. But because you
broke the rules, only one of you gets to see your
families instead of both of you. And this will be the only time
you can see your family until the end of
the 100 days. Warden’s playing dirty. The only thing I think I've been very
consistent about seeing my family. So who is it
gonna be? My man’s gonna see
his family today. - Really?
- Appreciate that. How does that
make you feel? Well, I just see him honoring me,
just like I honored him. Looks like I'm gonna be
getting that library time. And he's kinda also the reason
why we're being punished. This man is working with
the cops right now. Are you kidding me? - Confiscate all the paraphernalia.
- Are you serious? Oh, and there's
one more twist. You can keep your family
as long as you want, but he doesn't leave solitary
until they leave. Ok. Wow, this is brutal. Chandler, take him to solitary. I'm happy, but I feel horrible
at the same time. Yeah. Just don't sneak
books out, man. I’m gonna keep sneaking
the books out, warden. Spoken like a true criminal.
Close the door. Have fun. Oh, man.
This is brutal. Come on inside.
Lenny’s waiting to see you guys. Hi, Dad! Hi, Dad! Lenny! Go see him! Daddy! Look, it's daddy! That's so freaking adorable. Oh, I miss you so much! Oh my gosh… What's it like seeing your dad
in orange instead of blue? - Very weird.
- Yes, he never wears that. Your family can stay in here
as long as you want. Just know your partner doesn't leave
solitary until they leave. Have fun, everybody! Thanks. You miss dadda, mama?
Ah, you miss dadda. I'm happy to have
my family here with me. Apparently, I can keep them here
as long as possible. It's definitely gonna be
a recharge for me as well, and makes me want to push through
to get on day 100. I want everybody in the family
to be proud of me, not just the people
that are here. We're all counting on you. I got you. Hearing Lenny and his family
out there just chilling and I'm stuck in here
locked up like a dog. Every minute
I'm standing in here, I just got more and more mad
that I'm sitting in the solitary. It gives you PTSD.
It sucks. Ian got some time
to think about things. But as the hours
went on, Lenny spending more time with
his family only made Ian more mad. Ian, your time is up. I'll tell you what. I figured out your nickname
while I was in there, though. Oh, yeah?
What you got? You’re Lenny the Snitch. He's kinda also the reason why
we're being punished. You rat me out on
my book supply, bro. Look at this.
I got wiped clean. You come out here laying down
the law, why’s that? I’m a little upset, bro!
I was stuck in there. You were having a good meal.
You know what I got? I got nothing, bro. You volunteered to do it,
so why complain? You threw me
right under the bus saying it was my idea
for the smuggling. Everything was on video! But I'm just saying you coulda just,
we could have stand united. You snitched me out— I didn't snitch you out. They did not know about
under the bed. Bro, they have
camera footage! And I went into
solitary confinement— They have camera footage! But it still didn’t go
under the bed. So do you want to
hear me talk or you just want to express
your feelings or— I’m just saying, I took
the major one for the team— All I'm saying is this:
Watch what you say. - That's all I'm saying.
- Ok. Well, you made your decisions.
I make my decisions. It is what it is,
you know? It is what it is. You snitched me out. Ian’s definitely feeling in
a bit more of a somber mood today. I got to see my family.
Ian didn’t. It's definitely changed
the atmosphere as a result of that. He didn't want to play any chess,
he didn't want to play basketball. Lenny and I have definitely been
talking a lot less. He has his routine,
I have my routine, and that's all there is
kinda really to it. Even with the divide, Lenny couldn't
help but worry about his friend. You alright, buddy? I'm depressed. What's the matter? I'm ready to go home.
I’ve had enough. Even though it was only halfway
through the challenge, Ian was ready
to call it quits. Oh, man. I can't wait
to go home. All I want to do
is go home. I'm just fed up. Lenny will have to find a way
to rekindle their friendship. Because they can leave at any point
and if Ian goes home, they both lose. Gentlemen! - Morning, Jimmy.
- Morning! I have good news for
the both of you. Our day 60 offer, something that will help
bring you back together. Hey, Chandler!
Bring it on in! Here we come. A TV. Look at this thing. I know this TV is old, but it's what you're getting
since you're in prison. And you can watch these movies on it
over the next 40 days. What, were you guys born in the 50s
with some of these movies? What, you don't want to
watch movies? And the board games
are included? Of course. You can have all this for 1 hour a
day for the measly price of $30,000. I think this man's
losing it. I don’t know,
it's kinda tempting. Ok. An hour a day? An hour a day for 40 hours
of entertainment. Jimmy, you can't even watch
a movie in an hour. You just watch an hour of a movie,
we take it away and then the next day you watch the other hour
of the movie. The movie selection…
not really my cup of tea. This is a terrible deal.
Hard no. No? No. Hey, I thought you guys were bored.
No worries. Chandler, wheel it on out. Ah… man. Hold up, Chandler.
Pat him down. I didn't do anything. Pat him down. Oh my gosh.
In the underwear!? And he's looking for sympathy after
the last time he broke the rules. Get it out of here before
he steals anymore. Bye TV, bye VCR,
bye Titanic! Ian was not happy
with the offers, which was making Lenny worried
that Ian would leave. I just feel like I'm getting
brutalized every 10 days now. No family, not even a phone call.
It's pretty miserable, honestly. I could definitely feel myself having
a bit more of a short fuse. It kinda gets annoying. There's always something
to complain about with this guy. I feel like I got hit by a bus
the second time. I do not wanna be here
anymore. I'm definitely starting to get
worried he's gonna quit. I wanna go home. I wanna go home,
he says… I'm just going to be thinking
about that dogging. He dogged me on
that last challenge. I got dogged, dogged, dogged,
dogged, dogged! Man, I wish this guy would
shut up already. But because I had my biggest offer
planned for day 80 I decided not to give them
anything on day 70 so they'd have to heal the divide
themselves. When you're actually
in this thing, when you're in the belly
of the beast, it's hard. It's been very depressing and
sad the last few weeks. All you can do is read,
work out, play chess. It's definitely mentally challenging. I just wanna go home. It’s one of those days, huh? Ian was saying how he feels like
he wants to go home. It's gonna be an uphill battle.
Just gotta keep this guy on board. Because either one of these contestants
can leave at any time, Lenny was continually worried that
Ian would leave early and lose them both all the money
they had worked for. - What time is it?
- Time for you to get a watch! I was gonna ask if you wanna play chess,
but I'll go back and have a seat. His name's Leonard,
aka the Snitching Convict. You've snitched on yourself. That guy cracks himself up. Yo, we got the Snitching Convict! You’re the real convict, not I. It became clear that Ian
wasn't gonna let certain things go. Here, there was only an option
for a visit once, and only Lenny got
the visit. Desperate to stay
in the challenge, Lenny knew he had to lift Ian's spirits
if they were gonna make it to the end. Life is good! No, just makes me miserable. But things only got worse. I don't think I would have any problem
walking outta here early. Being here with Ian and
feeling negative the whole time, I feel frustrated. If they give me an offer
to take less money, I'm gonna take that. - What to leave?
- Yeah, I'm out of here. At this point, with only
20 days left, it looked like they were about to fail,
so I had an idea. My next offer was an opportunity
to rekindle their friendship. Or, the final factor that could bring
this entire video to an end. Oh boy. Oh, what do we got here? What the— In front of you is
a 2,000 pound boulder. Inside of which is a key that will
unlock a box containing $100,000. If you want that money, you will have
1 hour a day for the next 10 days to break this rock open
and get the key. By accepting this risk, you give me
that $50,000 right now. But if you complete it,
I will give you $100,000. If you guys wanna have a shot
at pulling this off, you're going to have to
work together. I'll give you guys
some time to decide. We just gotta grind it out. You know Ian, I know
you don't like to sweep, but you're gonna have to
put in your work on this one. Are we both gonna be able to
whack at this thing? Bro, we gonna be good! You gotta— We just—
We’ll be fine. There's no way Lenny! Feel like this is
a highway robbery. Now, do you guys think you have what
it takes to take on this challenge? We got this. - Do we?
- Absolutely. Alright! You brought this
on yourselves. Boys, take the $50,000. Just be easy with it,
'cause we're gonna get that back soon. It's gone! Be easy with it. Inmates, your first hour
begins now. For the entire first hour,
they hammered the boulder nonstop. This is hard! I think we just lost 50,000. I hate it here! We have 9 hours left
to get through this rock. But despite their lack of progress, the next day they came outside
and got started right away. We gotta hustle ain’t got
no time to play. Every minute counts. There it is! And even though it was only
their second hour with the rock, Ian was already settling into
more of a hypeman role. Come on, Lenny! There we go,
there we go Lenny! Everything we got
on this Lenny! And Ian watched from the sidelines,
all the way through day 4. Oh, man. Very disappointing day. All I know is I'm spent. Yeah, I'm pretty fried. We have to work
as a team. I think Ian could tell
Lenny was disappointed. Because the next morning,
he had a pretty big shift in his mindset. Let's go!
Yeah boy! And when Lenny tapped out,
Ian stepped up. Let me try hammering it
so we can get that key. Now, it was both of them together,
versus the boulder. Son is putting in
that work! We gotta real chisel. We're getting major progress right here,
as you can see, there's giant cracks. There you go!
There it is! Oh, she blows! We got hope now, boys! While they're hammering
that rock, I wanna tell you about the brand new
MrBeast Lab's Hybrids. These test tubes just started
hitting shelves. Inside these are random parts of Hybrids
that you can mix and match to create your own unique
MrBeast Lab experiment. They call me the rock slayer! And to make these things even cooler,
we developed an animated show, so a lot of the characters you'll be
creating with these Hybrids, you'll actually see
in the show in October. We got 18 minutes! We're gonna be close
to this thing! Hybrids are available
wherever you buy toys. Go collect unique parts, and build your very own customizable beast
that only you have. Panthar, should they buy ‘em? Let's see if they smash
this rock open. And even though they were
working as a team, an hour a day for 10 days
is a pretty tight deadline. Inmates, your sixth hour is up. 1 for the rock,
0 for the inmates for today. We made no progress. No progress, son. We need something that's gonna help us
get that key to get that $100,000. Each new day, they swung
hundreds of times, but the rock
wasn't budging. We did a lot of work.
No major progress. We might not make it,
I'm not sure. If we lose that 50 grand,
I'm gonna quit. Ian realized force wasn't enough.
What they needed was knowledge. There’s gottta be an answer in here. Oh, a book about rocks. I ripped out the pages that had to do
with our exact task. It says we need to use leverage. You think it can fit
under this? Oh, yeah. Push it that way. I can stack weights
on there too, to hold— It’s not gonna budge… But they still couldn't even put
a dent into the rock. This is a grind. Tired of you, rock!
Sick of this. The rock was just too heavy to lift. So with 2 days left, Ian went back to
his book to search for more answers. There's another picture right here
I was able to find. It looks like we're supposed to use
a chisel on a weak point in the rock. This is the kinda
the weak spot. Oh, it's coming apart!
Look at this! It’s splitting, Lenny! Dude, the whole rock's
split in half. Yo, we might literally make
$100,000 today! Not getting any movement. Inmates, your ninth hour is up. Man, we had a good momentum,
but we ran outta time. We are almost through
this thing. It's gonna be the final day. This rock is no joke! No, it's not. Way harder than
I expected it to be. I think at this point, it’s 50/50
if we get through this thing. I’m ready to go. Inmates, it's rec time. Suit up! It's rock slaying time. This rock is goin’ down,
ladies and gentlemen! Your final hour starts now. Keep pushing. - I'm right here with you.
- Yeah, we gotta go a little deeper. That's a thick freaking slab. Let's get this thing outta here! Look at this!
We got a key yet? - Here's home!
- Yeah! The key's gotta be in here! You have 30 minutes remaining. You better hurry up on this! This concrete's the only thing in our way
from us and 100 grand! 15 minutes remaining. 10 minutes remaining. Oh my God,
the key’s out! Oh, baby! $100,000 right there! Get it! The $100,000 is
officially yours! - Let's go!
- Let's get it! - Let's go!
- A hundred grand baby! Cop and con! Cop and con, baby.
For life. Are you guys ready to hear
what the day 90 challenge is? - Yes!
- Yeah! What I'm about to offer is actually… …nothing. Because on day 99, we have something especially brutal
planned for the two of you. I'll see you then. Wow. What's happening day 99? All throughout this video,
Ian has stayed true to his convict ways. Time flies when
you're stealing books. Well on day 99, he will have the chance
to steal the entire prize pool. Today is day 91. But most importantly,
it's my man Ian's birthday. I woke up to a nice surprise by
my bunkmate over there. He's such a good guy. I can't believe I'm spending
my third birthday now in prison, but at least I got
a good bunkmate. But even with over
90 days behind them, Ian and Lenny never imagined
that the final 10 days would be the toughest of
their 100 day sentence. Going slow. Trying to find new ways
to pass time in here. There's nothing else
for us to do. You got access to
the library, right? That would give us something to do
if I just emptied the library. If you pulled the computer out
that would be hilarious. That would be great, son! And honestly,
I don't blame them, 'cause this is the only prison where
acting up won't extend your sentence. I'll wake up early tomorrow
and get it. Operation computer is a go! You crazy! We've set up shop!
There we go. Good job, buddy. We're in business baby!
We got somethin’ new to do! Normally I would punish
them for stealing, but with day 99 quickly approaching,
I'm just gonna wait until then. We should bring this thing in here
today as a little chair. That we can put in front
of the computer! - Yeah, this would be nice!
- Here you go. Warden Jimmy, we're doing whatever we can
to get back at you this week. Oh, we could be like two brothers
sitting down next to each other. Hello, buddy. It's kind of poetic, that throughout
this entire video, the thing that brought a cop and
a criminal closer together was stealing. I like seeing Lenny go over
the dark side a little bit. He's encouraging me to break the rules,
too, this time. We're taking extra rec time today. Time is up.
Please come inside. Another win for the inmates. You're a troublemaker. Yeah, I've adapted to it,
like I feel comfortable with it. I'm glad that I got to experience this
as a police officer. To understand what it feels like to be
on the other side of the fence. I have no regrets. But what both of
these prisoners don't know, I will be putting the relationship they've
been building over the last 99 days to the ultimate test. Boys, boys, boys. Well, well, well. 99 days ago,
you two were strangers. Do you guys think you're gonna be
friends outside of jail? - Oh, yeah.
- We’re definitely close. Well, let's see if this final challenge
changes that. - Ah, man.
- Here we go again. For this entire video,
we've been seeing how two people from completely different backgrounds
get along together. You've been through so many
ups and downs and it all comes down
to this final day here. Wow. And that's exactly why
for the next 24 hours, I’m gonna put each of you in two different
solitary confinement cells. Warden Jim.
Twice solitary? But this time
there's a twist, because in each of your cells,
there is a button. And if either one of you presses it
before the 24 hours is up, you leave your cell
immediately and walk away with the entire
$480,000 prize pool, thus stealing all of your
fellow inmate's money. That's foul, bro. I don't think you're
gonna take it, but you have to ask yourself,
is he gonna take it? Just like he stole the books,
the movies… And if so, should you take it
before he does? He cried a lot about solitary confinement
when it came down to the family visit, and he's been saying, ""He’s not paying me to ever
go back into there again."" Well now I'm paying you $480,000
to leave this room. I know, that's why
it's a very tempting offer. I could imagine. I think he’ll do it. - You think he will?
- I think he will. I'd hit that button
before he does. Alright. Do you need anything? Uh, Freedom? Yeah, just press
that button. Alright, the 24 hours has
now begun. Oh, and one final thing. You won't know if the other person is left
until that timer hits zero. This sucks, man. I don't know if trusting
the criminal with a red button that can give him $480,000
was the smartest idea. I mean a guy that went to prison for fraud
could be a little tempting, you know? Worried about Ian not being able
to make it through. How do I know that I can trust him
with this prize money? They've been through so much
throughout this video that it feels like they would never
screw each other. But as someone who's spent a lot of time
in solitary confinement, a lot of time alone to yourself
can make you see things differently. I think someone's pressing it. This is my first time in
solitary confinement. This is Ian’s second.
He’s scared of tight spaces. I don't like being in
tight, confined spaces like this. This is not meant for me. Just remember, you're free to leave
whenever you want to. All with the press of
that button. Honestly, for me, I don't want
to see this counter because it just gives me
anxiety looking at it. So I'm gonna use one of these garbage bags
and I’m gonna put it over the clock. I don't need it in my face. But the longer they sat
in those cubes, the harder they thought about
what they could do with their partner's
half of the money. If I just go and hit that
red button right there, I could pay off all my restitution
in just one shot. Well, I owed a half a million
when I got out of prison. I could fix everything in the past
in just one push. There's a lot of things that
I could do with $480,000. That's an education for my kids,
a new car for me and my wife, possibly another house,
all with the push of that button. Do I hit the button,
get the $480,000 and pay off all my old debt
and screw over Lenny? Might have to. And the longer Ian thought about the money
the more he realized he deserved it more. Honestly, I feel like I had a way worse
time than Lenny these 100 days. Especially because I didn't get that visit
and didn't get to see my family. How come I gotta spend twice as much time
in solitary than Lenny does? Doesn't make sense. If he left, that’d be heartbreaking. I've put in just as much
work as him. If he can't toughen up
for 24 hours, then it just goes to show that
his convict ways are still the same. There's been too many
doggings to go around. I've had enough. Good night. I hope that Ian is out there
when this all wraps up. 100 days. All dependent on
the last 24 hours. If you're in solitary,
please come out to the middle. I repeat, if you are in solitary,
please come out to the middle. There are currently black curtains
blocking off both sections of the prison. If you're both standing there,
you'll each evenly split that prize pool. But if only one of
you is there, then you just spent 100 days
in prison for nothing. 3, 2, 1… Drop the curtains! Boom! They didn't screw each other over. My man! That is your $240,000—
Well now he dropped some of the ground. And to celebrate,
we brought your families! You two are free men! Hopefully they never go
to prison again! If you haven't already,
turn on notifications. We upload every other Saturday. Look how happy they are.

And that's why Mark Robber and I started Team Water. We've already planted 20 million trees with Team Trees. And then, of course, Team Sea, where we raised $30 million to pull 30 million pounds of trash out of the ocean. And now we're back with Team Water. Give 2 million people clean water all around the world. On average, for every $1 you donate, one person will receive clean water for a year. And we're hoping to raise $40 million in August to give 2 million people clean water for decades. So go to teamwater.org or to change someone's life or only a",unknown
Z4hVGCWH1Kc,"We're on a mission to give
2 million people all around the world
clean water. This village in Malawi
now has clean water impacting over
1 thousand people. This is the first of many projects
we’re gonna be doing, and the largest creator collab
in history. Over 3,000 of your favorite creators
are all coming together with over 3 billion followers
combined. This could be one of the largest
philanthropy projects in history. Team Water. All of us, teaming up from
around the globe, to get clean water
that will last decades to over 2 million people
in need. All starting here in Malawi.
Let’s give away some water! We just installed this pump. This is gonna be
the first time we use it. So the first cup of water is going to
the village chief. Oh, he’s downing it! This entire community
used to survive on water collected from
puddles like this. And every drop had to literally be
carried by hand. And that's what they do
every single day. What does this water looks like?
I mean, look at all that dirt. If I drank this,
would I get sick? Yes, you probably shouldn't. I think we can all agree this is
very unacceptable. I mean, look at those
chunks of the dirt in this water. That will no longer happen now that
we have that well. With local leaders, we made sure
that clean water is no longer
a concern here. Wow, look how
excited they are. Over a thousand people that
live around here are gonna be supported by
just this pump. Orkun or Ben, who wants to sub in?
I’m gettin’ tired. These two have 55 million
subscribers combined, and are just 2 of the thousands of
creators that make up Team Water. Here you go. That's a lotta water. Jimmy, is it gonna last
forever? As long as this well
is maintained, which is obviously what
Team Water's gonna do, this well can practically
last forever. The well we started at and this
water pump are just the beginning. Team Water is on a mission
to raise $40 million so that we can provide over
2 million people clean water. Let's keep going! Next, we went to
South America, where we received an amazing welcome
from the people of Colombia. You guys are too kind,
you don't have to do this. Amazingly, the pump for
the local water source was designed from spare parts
by one man with no formal training. You built this with recycled
bicycle parts. Yes And this well, it's what's
currently supplying over 1,000 people
with water. Yes. Oh my goodness. Out this pipe comes water that
the communities are drinking. And at first glance, this water
doesn't look too bad. But really, there are
little particles of dirt and more importantly,
bacteria that is constantly getting
everyone here very sick. Which is why literally right
beside the well that Christo made with
bicycle parts, we built this giant
water filtration system. The system filters water
in 3 stages. This removes dirt, sand,
and large particles. The water is then
pumped into here, which removes the bacteria and
even smaller particles, and then is pumped into here,
which removes the saline so that fresh water can be
pumped through this pipe. If anyone deserves
the first glass of water to come out of
this filtration system… it's Christo. Be my guest. Oh, he's going right for it.
Oh, he's downing it! The water is tasty! Do you approve?
Is it good? Yes! Yes! Yes! Thank you. Even Yolo, with over 33 million
subscribers, couldn't help himself. This water is better
than in my home! Team Water is going around the globe
with all of your favorite creators, like Mark Rober, the Stokes Twins,
and so many more. With the mission of bringing
clean water, the most basic human right,
to millions of people. We also built this massive
water storage container that can hold the equivalent of
20,000 bottles of water, and because we brought
a ton of reusable bottles, we couldn't wait to share the fresh,
clean water with the community. Hey, we got water
for everybody here! But unfortunately,
nearly 1 in 10 people don't have access
to clean water. Which is why we need
your help to raise $40 million. On average,
every $1 donated will provide 1 person with
clean water for an entire year. To power the water filtration system,
we installed a solar farm here, but we couldn't
stop there. We also have a special surprise
for all the little kids. That's your brand new playground! They're way more excited about
the playground than they were about
the water I gave them. We then traveled to the site of
an existing clean water project, where more than 100 kids come
to school just to get clean water. Here you go! Here you go, little man.
Majd, this one's empty! Ah, Jimmy! And even though this community
has access to clean water, there was still
a problem. Since people from over
4 communities have to walk far to reach this central
water source, we added 3 tanks nearby
for easier access. Now I'm gonna show you
how much walking it's gonna save people
in the community. - These jugs are so heavy.
- Come on Jimmy, push! It's hard to believe
nearly 1 in 10 people don't have access
to clean water. So for every $1 they donate,
someone on average will get 1 year of
clean water. - Oh my gosh.
- Well done, Jimmy. As you can tell,
it's very hard to carry water. Team Water goes above and beyond
to take care of people. And of course, we also gave
this community a playground. And then we went just north of India
to Nepal, to this small village where locals hike up a winding trail
to reach this water tap, where they rely on just
a piece of cloth to filter their water. Behind me is
1 of the 3 tanks that’s gonna be providing
clean drinking water to over 300 people
in the community. This tank, when completed,
will hold 15,000 liters of water paired with a mechanism
to clean the water, disinfect it, and make it safe
to drink. Once this is done
being built, how long is the tank supposed to
service the community for? Easily, for at least
15 to 20 years. We've teamed with WaterAid,
our lead global partner, to help provide
clean drinking water. They also support local governments
that handle repair and make sure everything
keeps working. Not only we're providing
the project, but we're maintaining it
for decades to come. We should probably
get back to work. Yeah, we should. You know it’s gonna take over
2,700 kilos of concrete to complete
this water tank. I think I've worked
18 hours today, but if that means these people get
clean drinking water just 1 day early I’ll work 24. Don't look me in the eyes
doing this, bro. Those three water tanks will provide
clean drinking water to 71 households and
around 300 people. On average every $1 donated’s
gonna provide clean water for an entire year
to someone in need. Make sure to donate! And if you're in
the United States, you might think this only affects
other countries. But science creator Mark Rober and I
are hard at work because in 2022, flooding caused
Jackson, Mississippi's entire water system
to fail, which had this assisted living
facility struggling. Having water to brush
your teeth, prepare meals for
your food, to take a bath. And to solve
this issue, we have a machine that pulls
water out of the air? That's right.
An atmospheric water generator. And I've no idea what
that means, which is why I brought
Mark Rober. What does this do? So you know how on
a really hot day your glass gets beads
of water on the outside? Yeah 'cuz, like, the water
goes through the glass. It's not going through
the glass, Jimmy. That water is coming
from the air. This machine
cools down the air, and then it can't hold
that water anymore, at which point you collect it
in this big tank. Plus it purifies it all
in the process. It's basically just squeezing and
wringing out air. How is that
humanly possible? This water is so
clean and fresh, you could use it
in an operating room. Cheers. Wow.
Science is amazing. This machine generates
enough water for the entire
assisted living facility, and they're going to be giving it to
other people in the community who also struggle
to get clean water. Team Water, we are eternally grateful
for everything. And Team Water is also partnering
with Dig Deep to give the people of
Rhodell, West Virginia an updated water system. In previous years,
they just had a lot of problems with the infrastructure
crumbling, so this should do a lot of good
for this community. All the way over
in Ecuador, we're with Ricky Limon and
4 of his friends with over 120 million
subscribers combined, and they're gonna help
clean up the water from this dangerously
contaminated river. Even though it's very beautiful,
the water here is dirty. The river is full of germs,
like E. Coli and Giardia. And unfortunately for the village
right next to the river, it's the only source of water for
them and their children. 34% of kids under 5, they got
malnutrition and stomach issues. So to change
these kids' lives, we're building filtration for each of
the 3 water storage tanks, using reverse osmosis filters
to make the water safe to drink. It comes out
completely clear. It's like magic. Great! I know that means
""very good"" Yes, this is
very good. And with some help,
we're giving water filtration bags to everyone in
the community so they can have clean water
with them anywhere they go. It will work so you can
drink the water. Did you tell her what
the bag is for? Yeah, I just told that, bro. I was just checking. Thanks to the Amazon Rainforest
Investor Coalition for supporting the amazing work
that's being done in this video. Meanwhile, across the world
in Zambia, fitness creator Browney is at
the largest community in this video. There are a staggering
9,000 people that do not have access
to clean water here, and their only option
is to dig shallow wells that often
get polluted. It's not covered,
so when we receive rainfall, there’s flooding into this well,
it gets contaminated. You'll find yourself
in the hospital. So we installed 3
10,000 liter water tanks to make sure that every last one
of the 9,000 people here have access
to clean water. Is it good?
Yes, good! Now that these tanks are supplying
brand new water stations all around
the community, they can finally fill
those old, unsafe wells. Let's go. Putting a stop
to this! The projects you guys saw in
this video are just a sample size of what we're gonna be doing
with Team Water to give 2 million people clean water
all around the world. Five years ago,
we did Team Trees, where we raised $20 million
to plant 20 million trees, and 3 years ago we did Team Seas,
where we raised $30 million to pull 30 million pounds of trash
out of the ocean. And now we're back
with Team Water. Only this time is
the audacious goal of $40 million. To give 2 million people
all around the world clean water for
decades each. And none of this
would be possible without our
lead global partner, WaterAid. If you want to donate, just click
the donate button down below. Or you can go to
teamwater.org, where you can see
every single donation, you can leave messages
when you donate. You can also see
the top donaters. And me and Mark Rober know
we can't raise $40 million on our own which is why you're gonna see
thousands of creators uploading videos, TikToks, shorts,
reels, Instagram photos about Team Water. And on top
of donating, I need you guys to go engage
with all that content. I need you to share it.
I need you to spread the word. And I need you to harass
your favorite creators to support
Team Water. Do your part to
make this a success. If you're watching this video

the counter doesn't start at $0. It's starting at
$500,000. That's because Shopify,
who powers the Team Water merch store has stepped up with
a $500,000 donation. Thank you, Shopify. Also a special thanks
to YouTube, who will match the next $2 million
donated to Team Water. So if you donate to
Team Water right now, instead of giving someone 1 year
of clean drinking water, you'll actually be
giving them 2.",unknown

pzBi1nwDn8U,"I just bought this luxurious private jet. And if this pilot can spend a hundred days trapped inside, he keeps it. No joke. I spent two and a half a million dollars on this private jet. And once you step inside, the 100 days will begin. Oh my god. And now that hour one of this 100 day challenge has started. I say we kick things off by taking it for a spin. Let's go. Let's take it for a spin. We're about to find out if he's a real pilot. He woohoo. If Armando stays on this plane for the next 100 days, it will forever be his to fly anywhere he wants all around the world. 100 days living in this thing. No problem. That was a smooth ride. This thing is nice. We'll see if the landing smooth. What a great flight. That was awesome. You're now 2 hours into your 100 day challenge. But if any part of your body touches the ground outside this plane, the video ends and you lose this private jet. Don't touch the ground. Good luck. See you when I see you. Let's see if Arando can win this private jet. What do I do now? This is my usual office. And here is the dining room. And allow me to show you the bedroom. This is where I will sleep apparently for the next 3 months. I don't have a real kitchen. Got a microwave and a airline cart full of canned meats. I don't have a shower. That's going to be a challenging part. And he is not wrong because even though this jet is a worldass vehicle, it's not built for a person to live in. So, over the next 100 days, it is going to get a lot more difficult. The walls are starting to cave in. This is what prison is like. Maybe I'm hallucinating. Sunshine makes me happy. I'm missing my family. Well, that's not good. Weird falling out of the sky. I am ready to be done with this. It's night one. I don't have a bed. The best option might be the chair. Good night. This is going to be my own private jet. It is day two. You would think this is a comfortable jet. It is not that comfortable to sleep in. It's day two. What better way to kickstart this video than to use this private jet for our personal game. Yeah, me and the boys are thinking. You want to fly us to a hockey game in New York? Let's do it. You can come, bro. We got you a ticket. This is not a trick. If you get off the plane, you lose. But you can still go to the game. Well, we'll see. And take us to the hockey game he did. But once we did land, thanks for the play. I wish I was going to a hockey game. I just had to stay inside. Wonder what Armando is doing right now. Playing yoga. Yeah. Using the jet just to go to a hockey game was so fun that the next day the boys and I had another trip in mind. Do you mind taking us to Miami, Florida? 100%. And that's the beauty of owning this private jet because we can literally fly wherever we want. All right. Welcome to Miami. Let's go have fun, boys. See you later. I love the fact that they are using a jet. I wish I could talk to my wife, my daughter. I miss them so much. But I still got 96 days of this challenge to go. Hope I can make it. This is my first day just hanging out in the hanger. I got to get in a routine. And so over the next few days, Armando would exercise, crab walk. Oh, that's more work than I thought it was going to be. Make his meals in the microwave, mix vegetables for the morning, clean himself without a shower. The only way I have to clean myself is with dude wipes. Make sure we're clean. Use the goodies. and try to find any place to sleep. My bed is a bust. Cut really messed up my neck. This is the only place in this airplane that I can fully stretch out. But even that wasn't enough to make Armando comfortable. I cannot stare at these four walls. We got to fly this airplane. And the following morning, that's exactly what he did. Never have I gotten the keys to a jet, go wherever I want. We're going to Niagara Falls. Going to go see them from the air. That is so awesome. Tell me that's not the coolest thing you've ever seen. We are at 4,000 ft over Niagara Falls. No jets ever get to do this. Hawker is a two pilot airplane. My great co- captain is here with me. The best office in the world. It is the best office. But unlike Armando, his co-pilot can actually leave the private jet. The end of my universe is right there. And even though he couldn't leave those steps come day 10, I devised a little loophole to change that. Ah, damn it. I screamed and you didn't even stop the door. No. What's life been like the last 10 days? Jimmy, there's no shower, no bed, there's no real kitchen. Overall, pretty good. That's not where I thought he was heading with that sentence. But I may just have a solution for you. Every 10 days, I'm going to present you an offer on this private jet. And your day 10 offer is a choice. You can choose between receiving these coordinates, which will lead you to a runway with $50,000 in cash on it, or Alpha, bring in the goods. I hook up a shower to your private jet. And before you make your decision, I feel like I should at least let you see the shower. And because it would obviously be an extension of your jet, you will not be eliminated if you enter that room. Ooh, looks like a real shower. And even though you don't need it, it comes with shampoo. Yeah. It's not only that it's a shower, this is space. I can stand up. This is amazing. It's time to make a decision. A shower for 90 days or $50,000 in cash. Which do you want? Showers for 90 days would be great. I'm going for the cash. Whoa. What? Oh my gosh. I'm meant to fly. The airplane's meant to fly. Let's take it. I can't believe he said no to the shower. Have fun retrieving the 50 grand. I can't wait. And now that I think about it, with this specific pilot, I guess shampoo wasn't really an enticing offer after all. Someone is going to meet us at these coordinates with $50,000 in cash, which on top of his $2.5 million jet could potentially make Armando the highest paid winner in the history of the Mr. Beast channel. $50,000 for not showering. No brainer. My biggest problem tonight is where am I going to put $50,000? So now I can actually take my family places. I can go to sleep with the sweet smell of money tonight. My weirdest task of this challenge so far is how to reorganize all this cash into as few cases as possible so they don't take up room in my airplane. Feel like the wolf of Wall Street. I might just sleep on money. 50 grand might have helped his bed situation, but it created a whole new problem in Arando's head. What on earth would I do with this thing if I actually got the keys to it? Do I sell it? Would I keep it? Owning this jet would be a dream come true for a pilot like Armando. But there's one huge problem. I just did a little bit of math. After the challenge, if I own this airplane for 3 months, that's going to be $8,000 for a hanger, $10,000 in insurance, $30,000 in maintenance. Obviously, the cost of owning a private jet can really add up. Which is why throughout this video, he has a chance to win up to an extra million on top of this $2.5 million jet in prizes and money. So, if he does end up winning, he can actually afford to keep it and make his family's dreams come true. I can't help but picture my family and friends in this airplane having just the best time going to some destination. I can picture it. Looks like I'm going to have to win a lot more money from Jimmy. I can't help but think that military service helped me prepare for this. Always started with being excited and being happy to be there. Then you get into your groove and then you hate your life and all your life choices and then you start seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. It's a Fortnite 2 weeks into this challenge and Armando is trying to remain optimistic. That's a great meal. Upgrading myself to a feastable. This is how I'm keeping track of all my chores. Here's the things that I haven't done today, and I just move them over as the day goes along. But even with a good attitude, he still might not make it 100 days because of his horrible sleep situation. I can't figure out how to sleep without something hurting. It goes down and up and down and up. It's the first day that my body is not happy with me. My workout was weak. My stomach feels icky. I don't know that I got a great night's sleep. Tried the couch again last night. It was a miserable failure. 10 minute one. That's how I'm feeling today. I'm really curious what he's going to offer tomorrow, but I need a bed. I had the perfect offer for Arando. But since I was filming a video where I was giving away a million meals, he had to come to me. Here we go. And to thank him for the flight, I brought Arando a special meal of his own. Since we're in Philadelphia, we got you some Philly cheese. How long is the flight to North Carolina? 48 minutes. Oh, that's it. Our private jet is awesome. Tomorrow is day 20. Time flies. All right, let's get All right, let's go. Normally, my offer would come on day 20, but in order to fully appreciate it, I'm giving Armono the opportunity to sleep on it. Your day 20 offer is this custommade inflatable bench specifically for this plane, or I give you coordinates to a mystery crate hidden somewhere across the world. And hidden inside that crate could be anything. Could be a quarter of a million dollars, could be a Tesla. It could be worth more than the jet itself. Oh man. I'll see you tomorrow for your decision. And so I left Armando for the night thinking he would try out the bed, but I didn't expect him to share his bed with a cheese steak sandwich. He must really need some sleep. That was the first night that I've slept comfortably on this airplane. Let's see if he chooses this inflatable bed or the mystery gift, which is actually worth $250,000. [Music] Knock knock. Is anyone in here? Come in. Welcome aboard. It's day 20. Yay. Please come into my living room, dining room, and bedroom. Be honest. How was the night's sleep? It was like sleeping on little baby clocks. Do you think having this bed increases the probability you make it 100 days? I know with this, my body can make it 100 days. On the other side, though, at a random set of coordinates hidden anywhere on this planet is the mystery box. This is something I can feel right now. I can't fly this airplane without getting a good night's sleep. Would you prefer this inflatable bed or the magnificent ginormous mystery gift? I'm in it for the long run. I am going to choose the bed to make 100 days. Yeah. Really? The mystery gift was a Lamborghini. Really? Yeah. Oh, don't dream of Lamborghinis tonight. Yeah. I'll count them in my sleep. Can't believe he just turned that down. Carl, he declined the Lamborghini. Okay, his lost. Turned down a Lamborghini. Whatever. It's cool. I got a bed. This is going to be a game changer. With this, my body can make it another 80 days. Thanks to the bed, Arando is thriving. Well, I feel like my eye is on the final prize, which is owning this jet. I want to learn about my airplane. It's only about 2,000 pages, but this is still an endurance challenge, and it's about to get way more difficult. Beautiful day to fly. Armando, how you doing? I would love to take the airplane somewhere. Interesting. But what if I told you for the rest of this challenge, you can't fly unless I say so. But you'll need to keep practicing because later in this video, you'll face the greatest challenge in your piloting career. So, I'd start practicing if I were you. Good luck. I can't wait. Let's do this. I practice in here putting in the routes are takeoff speeds, time speeds, emergency speeds, performance numbers, just part of professional flying. This morning I woke up and I started dreaming about all my dream places that I want to go. And while these practice flights may have been a great way to spend his time, Armando couldn't resist making it all about food. New Orleans is one of those places that I want to go to. Creole food and some beignet. There's a lot of good cuisine. Charleston seafood. I am very much partial to New York pizza. flying to Key West Cuban sandwich and some empanadas about barbecue today. And it's no wonder he's fantasizing about food when this is what he's been eating for almost a month now. I will not lie, it smells like cat food for 100 days. No one said this challenge was going to be easy. It's been 30 days since he started living on this plane. We have a very special offer. Hi guys. Come on down. Do you recognize this? I do. It's a galley cart full of food. the exact same food you've been eating the last 30 days. Since you only have 24 hours of food left, I brought you enough food to resupply you till the end of the video. Okay, but before we restock your jet with enough food for the next 70 days, I have an offer for you. Okay, you can turn down the canned chicken and tuna that you've been eating in exchange for a phone that has Door Dash installed that you can use whenever to order whatever you want. Obviously, the phone only has the Door Dash app, no call or text. But the catch is if you choose Door Dash, you have to let whatever is in this mystery box live with you in the jet for 24 hours. That's an entire day sharing this tiny space with something horrible. Don't don't open it. Don't open it. Things are breathing in there. Yeah. Well, I did do 22 years in the military. I feel like I could probably handle myself. I don't know if this is going to surprise anybody, but I'm going to pick the Door Dash. Really? Yeah. When you open this, whatever is inside of here is stuck with you for the next 24 hours. 24 hours. Here, give it a bang test. No. Harder. Snakes get violent when you do that. Three. Oh my god. Two. One. Open. You're stuck with Nolan. Have fun, Nolan. Try not to annoy him too much. Why would I ever be annoyed? I'm super excited about this. I have not had like human interaction really. Armando hasn't had much personal connections over the last 30 days, and Nolan hasn't had any in 26 years. What if I just started smashing things? I'm going to press buttons. Arando, stop letting him press buttons. Self-destruct. You do. I can't. I can't. I need to leave. No. Nolan in the cockpit. Oh my god, I'm so excited about this. Ooh, tacos. I guess if you're starving for attention and gourmet food, that smells amazing. This isn't the worst punishment. I don't know why you've been complaining about the food. This guy way better than Ken chicken. I feel like it's going to be a fun night. Let's see who the real pilot is. Oh man, I am the pilot now. Jimmy didn't say what you could order or how much money you could spend on Door Dash. I just wanted tacos. Tacos and we're going to buy a lot of things from a lot of stores. So the next day when I returned, I was in for a pretty big surprise. Nolan, what the heck? Come check it out. I had no idea, but Nolan and Armando had used Door Dash to order so much insane stuff just to decorate the jet. All this was available on Door Dash. Yeah, this was cool and all. I kind of needed the jet to fly me today. Are you saying we got to get rid of the tree and stuff? I'm saying we got to get rid of everything. Armando, we got to take some stuff off. We had to clean up the plane so it would be safe to fly, but it was worth it since where I was going, we were about to make a much bigger mess while shooting another video. While we were blowing up stuff, Nolan and Armono were still back in the jet. Now that Jimmy's gone, we have a couple hours. We do. I think we fly somewhere. Okay. It's a beautiful flight down to Florida today. I'm down for that. And they actually did fly down to the Florida Keys, which I just found out when I watched this video. Literally right now. That's the end of my 24-hour period on the jet. Shut it. Thank you for flying me to the Florida Keys. Get out of here. And he did get out of here. I'll bring souvenirs for the entire day. And when they flew back to Georgia to pick us up, I had no idea that they had ever left. 45 minutes home. Let's go. Now that Armando was alone in the hanger, the very first thing he did was bust out Door Dash to order more food. I could have almost anything. Going to do some bow buttons for dinner. This is going to be so much better than canned tuna. I'm ordering pasta. This is going to be a good one. I can eat fresh fruit and vegetables whenever I want. But soon, Armando started using the app for more than just food. Love it. I love it. I love it. cleaning supplies. This is a vacuum cleaner. Oh, yes. This is amazing. You can order almost anything. I get some resistance bands. Having Door Dash has been a game changer. I finally feel like I've nested. I've made this place my home. I feel at peace. But Armando soon realized that there's one thing you just can't Door Dash. I would love the chance to take this airplane all the way across the world with my family. I have a lot of great adventures. I've been to 70 countries, climbed Kilamanjaro, raced motorcycles, flown all kinds of airplanes, and met some of the best people in the world. I want to take my beautiful wife and daughter with me all around the world in this private jet. Probably the biggest thing now that I have a bed and Door Dash and I can order anything. I'm still alone. When Jimmy and the team come on board and we get to go somewhere, those are the only times that I really get to have fun in here. It made sense that he was getting lonely. You see, every video where a contestant stays for a long time, eventually the isolation starts to eat at them. And that's why when Armando had finally made it 40 days on a private jet, I wanted him to have some company. But I was deep in the jungle exploring ancient temples. So, I sent Carl and Chandler to help cheer him up. We have a really cool offer for you. A vacation with me and Chandler for $50,000? Yeah, I don't think so. Oh, $25,000? M. No. $10,000? I don't think so. All right. How about a dollar for $1? The deal. Deal. Here's your shirt. Welcome. All right. Where are we going, fellas? Let's open up the board. Check it out. This is a antilimactic. Woo. You're going to have the time of your life. Don't worry. Look at this strong guy. Yeah. A little fruit platter. [Music] I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, ""How can this vacation get better?"" Let's open the door. Projector system. I love it. Let's do a movie. This night would have been worth 50K. I had a great time. I feel like I'm recovering from a party. A lot of times, the day after a check-in is the hardest because on check-in days, you have a lot of activity. You get to see people. You get to talk to people. Today I'm kind of coming down from all that. Just here by myself with my thoughts. This stretch is a test. No flying, staring at the walls. I don't think this challenge is going to get easier. The biggest thing is going to be keeping my mind busy. So I came up with a routine. I sit up on the flight deck every day and I practice a flight all day long. Check was complete. But Armando found that indulging in flights of fancy only caused him to think about what he was really missing. I have this little doll of my daughter. Everywhere I go, even if there's turbulence, she's just happy and dancing. I wonder if she misses me. This morning, I woke up just thinking about like family. Like, I miss them. I want to go see them. I just want to cuddle with my wife. My weak point is my family. They deserve to know how I'm doing. Just want a hug. I'll take a hug. Coming up on halfway through the challenge. Almost day 50. I regret not being there for my family. I cannot believe that I have not stepped foot off this airplane. It's day 50. Let's see how are our boys doing. Armando, I thought you forgot about me. Yeah. How's it going? Oh my gosh. How's the first 50 days of the challenge been? I don't know what's going on in the outside world. I haven't seen anybody but you guys. I miss my family. This is the longest I've ever gone without seeing them, without talking to them. What if we made a phone call? Oo, I would love a phone call. Oh my gosh, I'm already tearing up. Babe. Babe. Babe. Oh my god. Oh my god. I miss you. Oh, I miss you so much, baby. Oh, your husband is now halfway done with the jet challenge. You know, if he potentially flew into your airport, would you meet him there and hang out with him tonight? 100% yes. I'm all like, ""Let's get this airplane ready."" As soon as I see them, I need to make sure I do not run off the airplane. I cannot wait for that first hug. There better be a marching band when we pull in. This is going to be a tearjerker. Maddie, look. I see you waving a damn. I just can't wait for my kid to run into my arms. Oh my god. Oh my god. Baby, hi. I knew I was going to cry. Welcome home. Welcome to my house. Okay. I haven't showered since the day I left the house. Oh, this is so cute. you know, just having a little jet picnic. It was clear that seeing his family gave Armando a much needed boost of energy, and he savored every moment he could. I can't believe I'm here. But unfortunately, these moments are always fleeting. It's a little surreal to be back in the hanger after having a day with my family. Now, they're just like forefront in my mind for the next 50 days. that could make it harder to make it the rest of the challenge. But being away from his family wasn't the only thing weighing on Armando. The walls are starting to cave in a little bit. It's starting to feel real tight in here. A little claustrophobic. Ow. Oh, godly. Not a whole lot of room in a private jet. This is what prison is like. There's only four more offers before day 100. I think Jimmy's going to make me an offer between extra space or maybe some extra money. Extra space. That would be really nice, but I'd have to think about it because I need like over $100,000 just to fly it and house it. How's it going? It's always good to see you. Can I have you at the door, sir? Absolutely. What do you think the offer is? I think it's going to be space related. Not space. Like we're going to take this to space. No. No. Like I think you're going to offer me more space. That is correct. for day 60. Carl, bring it on in. Coming. Hello. Wow. I am offering you an entire gym trampoline. Oh man. Everything you could possibly need is on this platform. Holy moly. Come on over. Yeah. Well, don't fall. How does it feel to be standing outside of the jet? It actually feels amazing. This is designed like the jet. It is currently touching the jet. So, it is a part of the jet. I could sleep out here. You can open the door and get fresh air out here. Oh my gosh. And you can have all of this for the measly price of $50,000. 50k. The same 50 grand you won on day 10. That same money you've been saying you need to maintain this jet. The only thing I needed was space. But for 50k, the only thing I need is a yes or a no. I like that. Let's go. 50 grand coming back to me or 50 grand staying in your pocket, but you're trapped in a jet. 10 9 8 Start counting. 7 We need an answer. 5 4 I'll take this space. Wa! Really? No tasty back seats. This space is now yours. But before you enjoy it, I kind of need a flight to New York. Let's go to New York. Before he can enjoy his new space, Armando had to fly me and my fiance Tia to the biggest indoor ski slope in America and then Florida for a private dinner by Chef Gordon Ramsay. Thanks for waiting. Absolutely. Let's head back home. Let's go home. But now it was finally time for Arando to try his new space. I'm actually getting to spend some time in what I'm calling the yard. This is amazing. Look at my kingdom. I just sit out here, have coffee. The extra room also made his workouts much easier. I was struggling to walk a mile per day. I just walked 3 and 1/2 miles in under an hour. I'm focusing on my mind, my body, and getting to 100. It's basically like having a playground attached to this airplane. It's a feastable kind of day. It is actually like an upscale European chocolate. Tastes really great. Feastable chocolate is made with simple, high quality ingredients and ethically sourced. Go get Feastables at Walmart right now and help us end child labor in the chocolate industry by eating Fastables. Armando was so happy about his new space that he was spending almost all of his time out there. I can't wait to see what Jimmy has for tomorrow. But what Armando didn't know was that I wasn't going to visit on day 70 because when I checked in and saw how much better Armando was doing, I worried we might have made things a little too easy. Haven't heard from Jimmy. Haven't had a check-in. Day 71. Hours and hours going by. It's day 72. No check-in from Jimmy. 73. Haven't heard from Jimmy. It's day 74. I'm starting to think he forgot about me. When I started this challenge, I thought the challenge was going to be flying all over the country. However, it's not. And even though the yard had improved Armono's quality of life, it couldn't give him what he needed the most, connection. Imagine being by yourself and not talking to anybody for 100 days. That's probably the biggest challenge is just the isolation. Goodbye, fellow hawker jet. I wish I was you flying away. I don't know what Jimmy's going to offer me. I just hope it involves flying. It's day 80. Sorry, missed day 70. I was taking my fiance on dates. Hi, guys. In 20 days, assuming you don't touch the floor, you'll be a free man with a $2.5 million jet. I can't wait. Dream flights with my family, with my friends. Those dream flights probably cost money. You know, view on a PJ is expensive. For day 80, would you like a chance to win some money? Are you offering? Give me one second. You guys just talk to him. Uh, we don't know what he's doing. For your day 80 offer, I have 10 cards. And remember on day 30 where you got the Door Dash phone? Uh, yes I do. We're about to put it to good use because on each of these 10 cards, there are coordinates to airports scattered across the entire country. You must fly this jet to each city. And when you get there, order an item on Door Dash. No matter what obstacles you run into, you must collect all 10 items and be back in North Carolina by day 90. And if you can, me and Door Dash will give you $50,000 in cash. Oh, airport number one's in Ohio. Good luck. I was worried about how am I going to fly this airplane once I win it. So, this money is the difference between making everyone's dreams come true or letting everyone down. If you gave me 10 days to get 10 items, we have planned 8 days to get 10 items because losing this challenge is not an option. I'm in Cleveland. I got to door dash a power bank. First item, Cleveland Power Bank. Order complete. Armando spent the night in Cleveland and decided to plan ahead for his stop in Charlotte. I know exactly what airport I'm going to. I know what address. I know what time I'm going to be there. With Door Dash and Dashpass, I can schedule a delivery and I am getting item number two in Charlotte. Pretty cool to be coming home to Charlotte. Here you go, sir. Thank you very much. Next stop, Providence, Rhode Island. I totally got this. Armando is gaining confidence and he knocked out the next three deliveries. That $50,000 good as mine. And then this happened. Oh, what's that? Uh, well, that's not good. She's falling apart. All right, we're taking her down. And due to maintenance, Armando was forced to spend the night in Denver. These little maintenance issues are starting to come up. One of our main gear struts was low. Luckily, we found a mechanic to come out and take care of it. We are headed to Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Yellowstone National Park to pick up a board game. Armono thought that the obstacles were behind him, but the issue wasn't maintenance anymore. It was weather. Supposed to go to Portland, Oregon. The weather's not looking great. I think we're going to divert to Idaho. I am losing one of my 10 days to weather. There's $50,000 on the line. I can't lose another day. It is what it is. All right, we just took off from Drake, Idaho. Now we're headed to Portland, Oregon to pick up champions. I have acquired seven of the 10 items on the scavenger hunt all over the country. I've got three left with only 3 days to go. I have absolutely zero margin for error right now. That is amazing. I need money to operate this thing once I win it. It looks like I'm going to get back to Jimmy on day 10. I just landed in Tampa, Florida. This is my last item, a Bluetooth speaker. I just ordered it and it's going to be here in 15 minutes. This is my last item. This is $50,000. Thank you very much. 10 items, 10 cities. Last one. Tampa, Florida. It is day 10 and we are headed back to the home hanger. Only 10 more days until this jet is mine. That's pretty awesome. Armando de, you just won $50,000. Catch, boys. All right, throw the items in here. Camping utensils. Had no idea what you meant by that. And not only did Door Dash give him $50,000, but they're also giving the chance for 10 of you to win $10,000 for scanning this QR code and signing up for Door Dash right now. If you don't have Door Dash on your phone, you're literally living life on hard mode. It's super easy. And while you're at it, you might as well sign up for Dash Pass for exclusive deals and discount. Scan the QR code, download it now. Thank you, Door Dash. Back to this challenge, though. On day 100, obviously, you'll win this $2.5 million jet, a bunch of money. It'll be great. But at the same time, I'm also going to offer you enough money so that you can fly this jet as much as you want. But in order to win it, you'll have to compete in another 100 day video on this jet. Another 100 days on this plane for half a million dollars. I don't know how I feel about that. Okay, luckily, you'll have 10 days to think about it. on day 100. Will I keep going for another 100 days for a half a million dollars? I don't know. Big decision. Armando survived the first 90 days on this jet. But the decision to possibly remain another 100 days became more difficult the more he thought about it. I've got pretty much everything that I need. I've got decorations. I've got a bed. Getting Door Dash was a game changer. I miss my family, but I don't have to worry about them because they've got a really good support network. If I had taken all of Jimmy's offers, I would have $100,000, a Lamborghini, and a private jet. But half a million, that pays for everything. I was almost at the end of this. If I were to sell it, I get $2.5 million for this jet, but getting another half million for another 100 days. I could actually keep the jet for longer than a couple months and fly it to all the places I want to go. Maybe around the world, Italy, Croatia. 100 days, take the jet, go home. Martha's Vineyard and it could stay an extra 100 days for half a million dollars. A lot of money. Do I need it? I don't know. Might be a game changer. Mexico City in Japan. Another 100 days for half a million dollars. Another 100 days from your family. Another 100 days on this plane for half a million dollars. It is the morning of day 100. Still haven't made my decision. It's day 100. How you feeling? I made it. There's still technically 10 minutes left. Don't step off. Can we spend the last few minutes in the cockpit? Let's do it. Yeah. I just realized I've never actually sat in the cockpit. All right. Welcome to the business end of the private jet. Do you remember what I asked you on day 90? I do. I've thought about it a lot. Good. But before you tell me your choice, bring them out. Tariq, come on, babe. We did this. Oh my goodness. Here's the thing. Your family has no idea about the second offer. The next 100 days for $500,000. I heard $500,000 just now. Enough money where you can fly this wherever you want. Whenever you want. You can fly them around. No. Yo, they're sorry. They're yelling at you. No. Say no. Oh, whatever it is, say no. Oh, she heard us. She said whatever it is. No. I've been through enough. Okay. Well, that might make it a little harder on you. Armando, I need you to come to the back. He better not stay on that jet. Yes or no? Do you want to do another 100 days? I If Armando steps off this jet right now, he'll end the video and walk away with the largest prize we've ever given away on this channel. But if he stays on, he's signing up to be in a new video where he'll compete for an additional $500,000. The past 100 days have all come down to this final decision. Daddy, this is the deed to the private jet. It's officially in your family's name. We own a private jet. Where are we going? Orlando. Orlando. Turn on notifications so you don't miss a video ever again. I hope you enjoyed.",unknown
BfKI_TQnQvo,"I'm gonna see if I can beat this cheetah in a foot race. You ready? Go. Get back here. Cheetah. Cheetahs are so fast. That was pathetic. But if you want to see that cheetah race fastest corner, click the video down below. Coffee who went.",unknown
FWAdfuPpLOc,"Who's faster? A cheetah or one of
the fastest cars in the world? Can a man beat a bear in
a fight? Can a tiger beat the world-record
high jumper? We're gonna answer all of these
and more— starting with the strongest man
in the world. And he's about to test his strength
against a 500-pound lion in a game of
tug-of-war. Any last words? It's go time. 3, 2, 1… Go! Alright and
we’re off. Oh my gosh!
Look at his mouth! Look at that
brute strength. Oh my gosh. The lion’s literally holding
the strongest man in the world back right now! Wait, what is he doing? Did that lion just
turn around? It looks like he's trying to
wear Brian out. Here's Brian pulling
a literal plane. But right now, he cannot get
this lion to budge. He’s starting
to struggle! Brian's actually
doing this! Oh, ok. Ok. You got like
3 feet left. You're almost
there! Brian, you’re almost
there! Brian won! Brian won, congrats! Yes! Brian just won! Did you have fun? Oh, ok.
I just— I won't talk to him.
That's fine. But that's just the first of
seven challenges that will test man
versus animal. Up next, we have the highest
vertical leaper on the planet. No joke.
That's his Guinness World Record. Of all 8 billion humans alive,
none can jump higher than him. And he's gonna be going against this
tiger to see who can jump higher… man or animal. Team Human.
Let’s go. Look at that majestic beast. Do you actually think you
can out-jump that? I’m not gonna lie. If she jumps 13,
I’m jumping 13. Oh, look how she's looking at him.
She's scoping you out. Is that a threat? She doesn't speak
English. I say we get into it. They’re gonna use this meat
to lure her and see if they can get her
to jump. - Let me see what you got, Luna.
- Oh, she wants it. Here it is. Here comes
the jump. How high will the tiger
jump? Oh my gosh! Now, if you can somehow jump
higher than the tiger… I want it to be because you beat
your own world record. So I'm not putting this
at 10 ft, 9 in. I'm going to put it
at 12 ft, 3 in. Exactly 1 inch higher than
your Guinness World Record. If he manages to touch this,
not only will he decimate the tiger, but he will set
a new world record. I mean, I think I got it.
12' 3""? - Yeah.
- I don't see why not. I’m gonna be honest,
I think Darius is lying. I'm not gonna lie,
I dang near think I'm lying. This does not seem
humanly possible. For the world record attempt.
Are you ready? Let’s get it. Let's see if you can set
that world record! Luna, this is for you. Can he do it? Oh my gosh!
Whoa, he crushed it! That was crazy! Luna, what are you gonna
say to that? Bro, you just jumped higher than
anyone in history. And you seem chill. Ah, I feel like
I can go higher. - I'm not gonna lie to you.
- Oh my gosh, this guy. I feel like I could go higher. You just set a world record.
He's like, ""Oh, I could go higher."" Brian beat a lion.
Darius beat a tiger. Animals need to
start winning. Team Human.
Let's go. I think Team Human is going to have
a much harder time with this next
competition. We are now in a bull arena
with Bubba. Hello. - Bubba is a bull rider.
- Yes, sir. We are gonna release 3 bulls
in this arena. 3 bulls? You need to carry as many bags of
money as you can all the way to the other side
of the arena, with 3 bulls chasing you
in the process. Every dollar you get in the bucket
in the next 3 minutes, you keep. - I'm ready, Jimmy.
- Good luck. Release the bulls! Here they come! Bubba, please
don't die. They're through the gate,
and they're coming right at him. Ok. Oh, they're
chasin’ him! Oh! Oh, they went right
past him. Take the money, Bubba!
Keep going! Go! He lost his hat. He's already secured
$10,000… Bubba!
Behind you! …but how long can he stay clear
of the bulls? Alright, here we go. He just got 2 more bags. - They're right behind you!
- Run, Bubba, run! Oh my gosh. I'd be terrified to be anywhere
near those bulls. Oh! They're coming right
towards us. Wait, no.
Go after him. Not me! Meanwhile, Bubba is somehow laughing while 3 bulls are barreling
towards him. This guy's way too chill to be running around with 3 bulls
that weigh 1,500 lbs each. ‘Bout to touch him
right on the head. He's adopting a strategy of
scaring the bulls away? This is hard! Note to self: don't do these things
with professionals. He literally breezed through
this challenge. - Woah, he did it!
- There you go. You won! - Congrats on winning $50,000!
- Thank you. What're you gonna spend
the money on? Probably
a new truck. Why am I not
surprised? But what will surprise you is who
wins the race later in this video. But this next challenge has
2 creatures built to shatter every bone
in your body. Alright, Nick. Come through
these doors. I'm terrified. This is Nick, who you might remember from his race
against the fastest man on the planet where, even with a mile headstart,
he still lost to Noah Lyles. And today, I'm gonna be giving him
a second chance at something
a little more deadly. In front of you. Just— I can't, bro.
I can't touch, bro. - Trust me.
- No, no. In front of you… - Bro…
- Bro, bro— When you see this footage, you're
gonna realize how dumb you're being. - What is it, bro? Ok?
- It's literally $100,000. Ok. He lost against Noah Lyles,
so he's not— he doesn't know what large sums of
money feels like. I did. To win this
$100,000, you must choose to survive 1 minute
in the ring with either— Take off your
blindfold. Ramy, a 500-lb professional
sumo wrestler… Why are you doing—
Why is he doing the… Or… Turn around. A minute in the ring
with this bear. Oh my God—
Bruh, yo! Ok. Why is he there? And if you think that
this bear is harmless… don't. Because he can literally tear
an average human to shreds. Thing’s big, bro. Tom, how you doing? He's— Ok, don't look at
him too long. It's time for a decision.
$100,000 on the line. You want to wrestle a sumo wrestler
or a grizzly bear? Oh, he's coming towards you.
He's excited. It's mobile now. Ok, I'm not going back to the bear.
He's up. Jesus. Alright.
Let's go with you, bro. You're picking him? I mean, I have to. What do you mean?
It's a big grizzly bear. You have your life insurance
with you? I don't. And so Nick doesn't
literally die, I brought an actual sumo coach
to suit him up for the match. See if you can bend your knees.
Slide your feet. Are you ready? Step in the ring! Come on. You're good.
Come here. Come to the middle. In order to win this
challenge Nick, you'll have to wrestle Ramy
for 1 minute without crossing over
the red circle. If you get pushed outside of
the circle before the minute is over, you will once again
lose everything. Touch your fist to the ground
to begin the match. Are you mentally stable? You're in too deep now, Nick.
Let's do this. Oh my God… Did you hear that? Bro, he's making sounds
worse than Tom! - Nick, touch the ground.
- Wait up! Wait up. Touch the ground, Nick! Go! Ok, alright.
Ok, ok. Alright, the timer's off. - Fight back, Nick.
- Wait, one second. Nick! Fight back, Nick! Fight back! Go for his belt, Nick! Nick! He’s suffocating me! He's toying with him.
It's nothing but a game. Nick, you made it
15 seconds. Are you just hugging him?
What're you doing? 20 seconds! Nick, you're almost
halfway done. Nick! No!
Fight back, Nick. Nick, fight back!
Fight back, Nick! 20 seconds! Nick! You’ve almost
won the money, Nick! Oh my God, he's toying with him.
It's a photo finish. 5 seconds! 3, 2, 1… He went over
the line. Are you good? You literally grabbed the side and
reached out before the minute ended. Bro, this guy's an animal
looking like a human. You lost to the fastest man
on earth. You've now lost to the best
sumo wrestler on Earth. I feel bad.
So… I'm gonna give him $10,000
for winning! Loser. Whoa! That's crazy. - Loser. Loser.
- I want to see you outside. I say we jump into what might
literally be the biggest challenge
of this entire video. And to lighten things up, I decided
to bring out comedian Trevor Wallace. Trevor, take off
your blindfold! Are we gonna address
the elephant in the room? This elephant is the best painting
elephant on the planet. Which is exactly why,
for our next challenge, we'll be doing
a paint-off. Both of you will have 10 minutes to
paint whatever creation you want. Whichever one of you draws
a better painting will have your masterpiece hung up in
an actual art museum. May the best— May the best elephant win. Hey, stop eating grass! If you don't want to mow your lawn,
just buy an elephant. Oh. She just smacked me
with her ear. She's trying to paint.
Here, give us a second. She needs a head start. Go ahead and go to your painting.
She can't wait to start. 3, 2, 1… Start the timer! This is the first time ever
on this channel that we've had
an elephant paint, so we're gonna hide the artwork
until the end. Paint?
Oh, not me. Jimmy, what do you want me
to paint? A giant school. I got you. Ok, so we're going to start with
a nice yellow, copper tone. That's the color you're
going with? Dude, what colors
are schools? Oh. There we go. Oh, she dropped it. We'll give her some
motivation. Orange. How come the elephant gets fed,
and you guys aren't feeding me? No Feastables,
no nothing? Can we get some
Feastables? Less talking, more painting.
Eat this. I hope it’s not chocolate.
I'm allergic. Huh? Alright. 5 minutes
left, Trevor. Yes, yes! Can I get my
Bob Ross wig? He's locking in. Bob Floss right here. Let's clutch up.
Let's go. We can't lose to
this guy. Oh, yes!
Good girl! - How much time do I have?
- Uh, 4 minutes. Hey, time's ticking,
Bob Ross. Yeah. Right now, that is
a yellow blob. No, no.
It's a G-Wagon. Look at that! Alright, go!
Paint! Oh! Not me.
Paint that thing. And the road,
the road. - You gotta get a sun going.
- Here, gimme yellow. Whabam!
Juilliard! We got 2 mins left so we'll clock in.
Let's lock in. You're doing great. She did not like
that paintbrush. Trevor, we’re running
out of time. - Dude, this is so bad.
- Believe in your art. These were supposed to be bricks,
not windows. I’m gonna help you out.
We're running out of time. I feel like a firefighter with
the hose. Let's go. One minute left!
We might actually win. You might actually lose
to an elephant. I feel like I'm painting at
a funeral. Now, this is her signature move
that she puts on all her artwork. - Three…
- Just keep going. - Two…
- Oh! That was a mistake. That was a fumble. One! Time is up! No! He didn’t finish! But before we judge these
works of art… Coming up, we have
a literal cheetah racing one of the fastest cars
in the world. But for now, I brought in
a professional with over 30 years of experience
to judge these paintings. And now, on
a scale 1 to 10… One being bad.
Ten being good— - Two.
- Two? - Two.
- Ok. It feels a little bit
adolescent, so maybe someone's getting in touch
with their inner child. Woah, ho-ho! Talk about the art,
not the artist! Hey! No influencing the judge. And now to reveal the masterpiece of
the world's best painting elephant… Are we really gonna grade this?
This looks like a clown threw up. She painted this
on her own. What are your
thoughts on it? I feel a lot of joy in
this particular painting, but I see that they're being
honest to who they are. You can't separate the art
from the artist. What do you rate this art piece
out of 10? I would give her
an 8 out of 10. Whoa! Trevor, you lost to
an elephant. Whatever, man. Your competitor is literally hitting
a Fortnite emote. How does that
make you feel? Alright, you're good.
Rest… Go back to
Rainforest Cafe. And as promised, here's Isla’s painting hanging
in a real art museum. Exquisite. I wonder if any of
these people realize this was painted by
an elephant. Anyway, for this
next challenge, we have the most advanced soldiers
on the planet. How long would it take you guys
to kill me? - 30 seconds.
- They're very scary men. And we're gonna see
how long they can hide in this massive junkyard
from Odin, one of the best search dogs
on the planet. How long do you think
they’ll last? Probably about 5 minutes. And if any of you can evade
these dogs until morning, you'll split $50,000 - Yeah!
- Let's go. Alright. 10 minutes to hide. 3, 2, 1… Go!
Have fun! While these men spent half of
their lives evading enemy capture, these dogs have been trained since
birth to seek out humans. So I will be shocked if these guys
can survive until morning. Get over to our
hiding spot here. I just gotta evade these
dogs the longest. These guys are running around
like a bunch of fools. I'm not gonna sweat. Rub up on some of these vehicles
just to get my scent. They’re all probably doing
zigzags and rubbing up against as many
vehicles as they can.  While Johnny created false flags
by rubbing up against cars. Carlos— I found some water! decided to mask
his scent. Here we go! He literally dunked himself in
the river hoping to throw them off. Now I’m going back to
my hiding spot. Most of these guys had
the same strategy. Create a diversion for the dog,
then hide in a car. Gotta find the right spot. While one of them had
a different idea. Hey, what's up? So I'm sitting up
in a tree about 50 ft up. And the only tree in-play. Here's the whole yard where
everybody's hiding. I just pray that God will hide
my scent. Hopefully they
don’t find me. The 10 minute timer is up!
We're coming to find you. Here they go.
You can hear the dog. 3, 2, 1… Release the hounds! - And they were off. Let's go.
- Alright, we're good? Yep. Watch the dog
and his behavior. You'll see it when he
catches that odor. You’ll see his nose
goes up. How can dogs smell
this good? It's called their olfactors. The longer the snout, the more
olfactors that these dogs have. It’s nice and windy up here so
they shouldn’t be able to smell me. I know it’s a win for me because
I’m not near the ground. Remember, this is
a very large area. So the dog has to systematically
decipher what odor is a person. And what's just somebody who
walked through here earlier. Alert! Alright. Standby. Sage might’ve found
something. Oh, the doors are
unlocked. Yo! - They got me.
- You're the first one found. Oh my God. The dog’s barking over there,
so they must’ve found somebody. Yo! That's crazy. Sage might’ve scanned
4— 500 cars. This is the only car that Sage
barked at, and he was in it! If it makes you
feel better, everyone who gets found is getting
a Lenovo Legion Pro 7i powered by Intel Core
ultra 9. These laptops are beasts, but we still got 4 more people
we need to find. Let's keep going. On our Lenovo Legion laptop
powered by Intel, we have a map of
the junkyard. We're gonna search
over there. Go over to the bus,
see if we find someone. - If not, rendezvous up.
- Yep. Ok, we got
a game plan. They’re coming my way,
so I gotta kill the light. Oh, he's on the hunt. I’m gonna call an alert
on this van! Oh, wait. Sage is barking
at this car. Sage, is it this one? Step back. Alright, is anyone
inside— - Oh!
- You got me. You could’ve just
opened the door. Two down.
Sage is crushing! I'm sorry, but you've lost
$50,000. But don't worry, you'll be able to overcome any
obstacle with this brand new laptop. That's the power of Lenovo
with Intel inside. Nice. Thank you. Alright. Let's keep
hunting, Byron. Alright, #2 has been found,
which was close to me, which could throw
the dog off. I mean he may not find me because
he just found somebody close to me. The dogs came super close
to finding the marine. Becky and Sage just
walked by. Oh my gosh, they walked
beside the car. Didn’t find him.
Holy cow! But then something completely
unexpected happened. I don't know how they did it, but somehow the dogs could not find
these guys. One of the guys threw
a Redbull can in here. What we have here is
a false find. Somebody came here
and has left. Their trap worked. Thank you, Lenovo and Intel,
for giving us these computers. And if you guys are interested in
buying one for yourselves, just go to this website right here
or click the link in the description. Even after searching for hours,
it was like the soldiers disappeared. The dogs have been looking all night,
and now the sun is coming up. We can't find these
people. It’s 5:30 in
the morning. It's obviously getting
lighter out. There's about 3 of us
still out here. But then, mere moments before
we ended the challenge… Alright, they’re really close
right now. Is he in there? Is there anybody
in this truck? - Someone’s in the back!
- We got somebody! Got me. You might be
a little hungry. I actually got you a Feastables
Peanut Butter Cup. Let me know what you think. Oh yeah. That's a 10
right there. Come on. And with the time
finally up, the 2 winners emerged from
their hiding spots. It's a good one. Oh, that was
a long night. Congrats to them on
splitting $50,000. And now, the moment you've
all been waiting for. After the most insane
man vs. animal competitions, it all comes down to
this final challenge. This cheetah is gonna race
the fastest car on earth. Let's see who wins—
Oh, cheetah! Alright, I'll get it
to come back. This cheetah reigns as the literal
fastest land animal on the planet. Clocking speeds
so intense, that humans need the speed of
a Formula E race car to stand a chance. Which is exactly why I brought not
just 1 but 3 cars to try and beat it. All starting with
this golf cart vs. cheetah. Oh, look at that thing. Ready boys? - Let's do this.
- Yup! 3, 2, 1… Send the cheetah! Oh my God,
it's so fast! Oh, it's not even
close. It's crushing us. We’re getting left
in the dust! I can't even see it anymore,
it's gone. The cheetah literally
already finished, and we're still halfway
through the race. This is embarrassing. Sir! Cheetah, you didn't even give us
a fighting chance. We need something faster.
Bring out the next car! We all knew a golf cart wasn't going
to beat this cheetah. But for this next race,
I spared no expense in acquiring one of the most
beautiful cars in automotive history. Minivan vs. cheetah. Go! Oh, here we go. - Go, Jimmy! Drive!
- Oh, what is this acceleration? - You gotta speed up faster!
- What're you doing? I have literally gas
all the way to the floor. It is gone! This thing does not
accelerate. Why’d we choose
a minivan? This is embarrassing. We already lost. What are we doing? Wait, cheetah! Cheetah! You're supposed to cross
the finish line. The cheetah stopped conveniently
right before. Oh, there it is. It's teasing us. I guess that's what can happen when
you work with animals. - It felt sorry for us.
- Yeah. But before this cheetah races
a Formula E car, we need to prevent it
from overheating. Which meant we somehow
got to do this. I wanted to say hi
to the cheetah. I'm good, thanks. - Millie— I touched the cheetah.
- Oh my God, bro. For whatever reason, they actually let us hang out
with this apex predator. I can't believe we're just
next to this right now. Come here, Millie. I can't believe I'm literally calling
a cheetah over to me. It is so big. Give it a pet, Nolan. Nolan, stop touching it.
It did not like when you touched it. You guys are actually crazy. Oh my gosh, this cheetah's literally
exactly like a giant cat. You’re so cute! We're giving the cheetah a little bit
of a break in between the race, that way it's not too
out of breath. And in case you guys
are curious, we partnered with
the American Humane Society, which is basically making sure
that all the animals are being ethically treated
while we're filming this video. That's because today there are less
than 8,000 cheetahs living on earth, which is why it's important to me
that all of these endangered animals are treated very carefully
on our set. It's so soft! The cheetah is purring
insanely loud. That means it
likes us. It looks like Millie is ready for
the next race. Let's get this on
the road. It's finally time for the moment
we've all been waiting for. What you're about to witness is the
ultimate showdown of man vs. animal. This race is so monumental,
in fact, that if anyone is going to ruin it,
it might as well be Nolan. Let's answer the most important
question in modern history… - Three!
- Can a cheetah…. - Two!
- …outrace a Formula E car? One! Let's find out. Go! That was so fast. The car just flew past
the cheetah! Oh my God! Although Millie
didn't win, it is crazy to me that
a cheetah can hold its own against the same car used in
the Formula E World Championship. But when the first car was made
more than a century ago, over 100,000 cheetahs were
alive in the wild. But today with less than
8,000 remaining, it's our job to protect these extraordinary
creatures from extinction, so that they can keep inspiring us
all to push beyond our limits. Millie is like the sweetest animal
I've ever met.",unknown

pe_ejTiIcSs,"This is my friend Majd. And if he loses 100 pounds
in the next year, I will give him $250,000. This is Majd’s new home, and he'll have his own
personal gym, unlimited healthy food, and everything else he needs
to lose 100 pounds. This is actually crazy. But Majd,
there is a catch. If you step on this red line before
you lose 100 pounds, the challenge ends,
and you get nothing. If he actually loses 100 pounds, this will be the craziest
transformation ever. This is my home for the next year.
This is actually insane. See that?
That’s my gym! 250K… that's the goal. Anything you need to lose 100 pounds,
you literally have it here. This is the longest challenge
we’ve ever done. This might be one of the longest
challenges ever done. And I didn't know it yet, but the journey Majd would experience
in this video was unlike anything
we've ever captured. It will go down as one of
the most powerful stories we've ever shared on
this channel. Honestly, I'm super excited.
364 more days. I’ll see you guys tomorrow. Good morning.
It’s day two. What do I want
for breakfast? Ooh, you know what?
Could make an omelet. Going from PB and J's,
energy drinks… to this! First breakfast of many. All right, well…
I guess I better start working out. One… He just started working out and
I think he's already going to bed. I think it's hitting him just how
hard this is gonna be. Which is why we got him a trainer.
I'm gonna go introduce ‘em. This is your personal trainer,
Coach Wall. - You're about to get me shredded?
- Yes, sir. - About to lose this belly?
- Yep. I can't wait to see this man
skinny and jacked. Come on! One of the most exciting things
about this video, is right now, Majd doesn’t even
know how to squat. By the end of this video,
he's gonna be a machine. Sit your butt down toward your heels.
Drive back up. I might poop myself
doing that, brah. How much do you think your life will
change once you lose this 100 pounds? I'll just be happier.
Longevity of life. You know, being able to be
with my fam. My niece and nephew,
that's really the most important, so. The beginning of Majd’s
fitness journey was off to
an incredible start. He stayed active
every single day. …Five. Good.
Come on! But since we were only weighing him
once a month, he didn't even know how much
progress he had made. 100 pounds is tough. I don't even know if I've lost
any weight yet. But Coach was teaching him
how to eat healthy for the first time
in his life. Coach cooking today.
He teaching me how to grill! - That's good, right?
- That's so good. The plan your trainer
laid out for you… You've been completing up to
18,000 steps per day, you've been lifting weights
5 days a week, and you're only eating
2,500 calories per day. This is life-changing, right?
I want to lose this healthily. This is what I've been eating.
This is what's been getting me full. This is the new and reformed Majd,
not the past Majd. Every day of his first month,
from the moment he woke up, Majd put everything into
losing this weight. From cooking and
eating healthy meals to doing every workout Coach
designed for him. And honestly, it was
amazing to watch. This is the face of a man
who wants it. - Fantastic job today.
- Thank you so much. Super proud of you. It has officially been 30 days since
Majd began his weight loss journey, and he has no idea how much
weight he has lost. Let's go find out. It's been a month! - Let's go!
- Yeah. How you doin', man? Oh my gosh, he's sweaty—
which is what you want to see! Means he's working hard.
It's been a month in here. And now it is time for your
first monthly weigh-in. We're gonna do this every month
until you've lost 100 pounds. Majd, when you are ready, step on the scale and
reveal how much weight you have lost! Come on! When you started this video,
you weighed 324 pounds and now… - Holy crap… Majd.
- No way. You lost 20 pounds! What!?
Yeah! That is insane! 20 pounds! - That’s insane, man. Congrats.
- Let’s go, baby! Majd, that's 20% of the total weight
you need to lose in this video. The weigh-in isn’t all I had
planned for today. What do you
got planned? Every 30 days, we're gonna be
introducing challenges where you can add money
to the prize pool. On day 1,
we tested you, and you weren't very good at
doing push-ups. So your first
challenge is: On day 60, after your
second monthly weigh-in, for every push-up you can do,
I will add $1,000 to the prize pool. So if you do 100 push-ups,
I'll give you $100,000. Wait, that's actually crazy.
That's a lot. Anyways, I'll see you for
the next weigh-in. Bye, Jimmy.
Thanks. What can we expect over the next
30 days from Majd? Over time, we're only going to
decrease his calories, increase his activity,
and up his cardio. So it's gonna get harder with him
as the video goes on. He is gonna suffer.
This is gonna get harder for him. And every 20 pounds Majd
loses moving forward, you'll be able to see
a noticeable difference in his physical appearance. I lost 20 pounds,
which is crazy. This is not like,
“Oh, I lost 20 pounds, let's go.” No, the challenge is lose
100 pounds, you know? And with Coach Wall’s help, you know,
I think we're gonna crush this. And crush it, they did. Oh, whoa!
Look at this guy! 22… 23… Majd was the definition
of determined. Gimme 25. Alongside the help of Coach and
his best friend, Chandler. Pushin' each other.
Love it. 'Cause when the opportunity
arises where, hey, Jimmy asked me
to do push-ups. You know, if I hit 50 push-ups,
I could win 50 grand. I didn't expect that. 1… 2… 3… 4… All right, first smoothie ever. Literally the first smoothie that
I have ever made in my entire life. Protein scoop… Oh, let's hope this is good. Bruh, I'm not gonna lie,
that looks pretty good. I'm just gonna do the
fruit bowl from now on. It was obvious that just doing
push-ups every day wasn't going to keep Majd on pace
to lose his weight. So as you might
have guessed, Coach was there by his side
day in and day out, helping him
push the bar. - What's up, chat?
- How you doing? What up, big dawg? What a day, man.
I'm almost done here. - You're almost done.
- Holy— Sorry, bro. Come here, man. Every single morning.
Make breakfast. I’ll walk my track.
I'll play basketball. I know, like,
a lot of it's the same. It's literally how
my days have been. This is it, bro.
I'm really doin' it! And I love it,
I’m so grateful for it. I like how much you're having to
pull-up your pants. That means we’re on
the right track. Yeah, I hit 15k steps yesterday. - 15?
- That's what we do here. Let's go. Steak, egg,
and cheese today. Every day it’s looking
better, right? Every single day.
Unbelievable. Now, pushing your body to its limits
every single day isn't healthy. So we made sure Majd
took rest days and got weekly checkups from a doctor
monitoring his progress. You're healthy, doing great.
Your stamina's improved. So I think you should continue with
the weight loss that you're doing. That's awesome.
Thank you so much, doctor. I just gotta make
my basketball shots, do 20 push-ups,
and 20 minutes on elliptical. Should be a breeze. But even after rest days, Majd was
still just locked in as ever. I have a goal that I wake up
every morning and I go to. Every morning,
I choose to win. I believe in myself.
I believe in myself to the highest. There's not a doubt in my mind where
I can't achieve something that, you know,
I'm putting into my mind. Good work this week. This might be
the best week yet. Your gains, the increases
and everything. Let's just say push-ups have gotten
significantly easier. We're now on day 50,
and I brought Majd a special present. - Majd!
- What up, baby? You've been killing it
in here. You've been following your diet,
working out consistently, and walking more than
5 miles a day. And to celebrate,
I brought you a gift. Get outta here. Brand new clothes! You have lost so
much weight, we got you clothes that is
one size smaller. One size smaller
than this? Let's see if it fits. Oh, yeah. What do you think?
Does it fit? Yeah! Ok. Next step is extra large,
then large, then a medium. Wait— - You’re on the path, man. Congrats.
- Let’s go! Don't pick me up—
Oh God, don’t pick me up. In 10 days is your next weigh-in and
the push-up challenge. - You ready?
- I'm ready, man. - I'll see ya then.
- See ya, Jimmy. Please don't win too much
money on the push-ups… This guy doesn’t know I’m about to
take all his cash. Which at this point,
Majd was already on pace to win at least
another $20,000. Dude. Good work
today, man. Proud of you for
that 2XL, baby. - Thanks, man.
- Yeah. Graduated! Having dropped a whole clothes size
gave Majd a huge confidence booster. - How's that 2X feeling?
- Good. - Yeah. You look great in it, man.
- Thanks. Dude, I'm really proud of you.
This is a big step. Although maybe now he had
too much confidence. Over the course of
the next few days, Majd seemed to have lost
a lot of interest in keeping up with
his goals. I'm not lookin' forward to
this right now. Yeah, this sucks. Maybe it was because Coach
wasn’t there… Coach is not gonna be in for
training session today. Or the weather… Bro, it's actually snowing! Majd was just simply
not being himself. I am tired. But then we unfortunately realized
just exactly what was bringing him down. So one year ago,
I found out my dad passed away. One whole year ago,
my life was changed. Like I lost, like X amount of pounds.
I FaceTimed my dad. He's congratulating me and telling me
“Oh, you look great,” you know? When you lose a parent,
especially just losing someone close, like, it's gonna take
a toll on you. Went from almost 270 back to 324
in a matter of months. I'm just so proud of myself
to see how far I've come. I'm not lettin’ him down. He's with me.
He's watching. Luckily, Coach was there for him
in more ways than just fitness… I love you too, Dad. …and was beginning to have
a profound impact on his life. Good man.
Made a good son. Thanks, Coach. - Yeah, brother.
- For real. I got you. Thanks for sharing
that with me. It looked like Majd had found
strength to keep pushing after all. It has been over two months since
we started this challenge, and I have a surprise for
Majd after his weigh-in. - Jimmy!
- All right. - It's game time, baby.
- What up? - Before we get into these push-ups…
- Let’s go! - How much do you weigh?
- I don't know. - Let's find out.
- Come on! It has been over 2 months. Last weigh-in,
you weighed 303 pounds. And now, Majd weighs… Oh my gosh. I wanna see. 286 pounds! Yeah! Since the beginning of
this challenge, you've lost 38% of
your total goal weight. Wait, where are you going? Majd! Come on! I'm gonna interpret that as,
he's very happy right now. Come on! Push-up challenge! As promised, Majd,
every push-up you do, I will add $1,000 to
your prize pool. Get in position. On the first day of
this challenge, you weren't exactly
the best at push-ups. - How many can you do now?
- Let's find out. When you're ready… $1,000… $2,000… $3,000… $4,000… $5,000—
Majd, you’re getting rich. $11,000… $12,000—
Yo, this is crazy. - $18,000—
- 19! - $19,000—
- 20! All right, you're up to
20 grand. Oh, yeah.
I’m here. How many more do you have
in you? I got some, bruh.
I got some— Got more in you?
Majd, look at this right here. This could go in
your bank account. Let's go. 25, 26, 27, 28… 29. 30 grand!
I believe in you. 31. 32— 32? Ah! 31 push-ups,
aka $31,000, will be added to
your prize pool. Look how red
his eyes were. Bro, you just
pushed yourself. I'm very proud of
you, man. You're becoming healthier,
you're losing weight, and have now over 2-X'd your
push-ups since being in here. You should be really
proud of yourself. Thanks, Jimmy.
For real, thank you. And follow me to find out what
your next challenge is. Oh my gosh. - Wait, why are we going outside?
- Uh, you'll see. Your next challenge: every $1 you can
carry for a lap around this building, I will add it to
your prize pool. Ok. That doesn’t sound
too hard. Well, it depends.
You might get greedy. And you might try to carry
$500,000, but you can't make it all the way
through, and then you lose. That's a lot of thinking. And to top this day off,
which I would say's been pretty good, I have one final surprise. Come on inside and
come see your family. Mom! No way! Oh, no way! My mom, my sister,
my brother-in-law, Dani! Have fun with
your family. They can stay here
as long as they want. - No way!
- Yup. Mom— you guys
are here! And over the next
few days, Majd's family did
everything they could to support him in
his weight loss journey, like cleaning the gym and preparing meals so that he could train for
the money walk challenge. The big focus right now is just
to get your grip strength up and the endurance. Coach wants me to emulate
how it would be for me to carry duffel bags
full of money. Keep in mind, too,
the faster you walk, the faster it's gonna be done. We're also working back
your shoulders, your upper back. The main goal with this is we're
gonna be building up your strength to be able to
do some work. And with Majd progressing so
much in his workouts, Coach's incredible impact on
his life was so great, he became a member
of the family. [singing “Happy Birthday” in Arabic] Thank you so much.
You do a great job! And with his family visit
coming to an end… Bye, mom. And me being halfway around the world
shooting another video… For the next few weeks,
Coach and Majd's connection would only grow
even stronger. You have one new message. Yo, my man. This is so cool,
we get to do this together and form this deep friendship.
Man, you rock. The way I've come to know you over
these past couple months, man. It’s like, you're just a very kind,
caring, compassionate human being. You're gonna positively influence
millions of people. I haven't thought that far. I don't know why I got this
idea in my head. What was that like,
jumping in that money? All right, your turn,
Coach. Yeah, I don’t know if
I want to get out of here. - What up, man?
- Yo. It’s ya boy, Coach. Who this? And because their bond
was so powerful, what came next was the worst thing
that's ever happened in one of
my videos. And because I was still out
of the country, one of my producers had to
break the news. - Yo!
- Yo! - Hey, how's it going?
- Will, right? Yeah. How you doin'? - Are you tellin' me I'm fired?
- No. This is bad. No, I wish that’s what I was
telling you, I'll be honest. Um… but I do have
really unfortunate news. I hate to be the person to
tell you this, uh… Coach Wall was found dead in
his apartment yesterday. No. No… No, man. No. No, don’t lie to me, bro! No, that’s not something
I would joke about. Oh my God…. Oh, no… No, this has gotta be a joke, bro.
There’s no way… Bro, there’s no way… Over the next
few days, visitors poured in to help Majd
process his grief while he contemplated the decision of
continuing or stopping this video. Because ultimately, whether or not
this video continues was up to him. You know, both times
I experienced a loss… it's snowing outside. Yo, my man! This is so cool
we get to do this together. —so cool we get to
do this together. Coach? I look at
the door and… I just hope he
walks through. Coach was side-by-side
with me. And now,
he isn't here. He was a good dude. And he spoke very highly of you.
And he believes in you, man. The moment I arrived back in the US,
I went to see Majd. And I'm choosing not to play our
conversation here, but essentially, I wanted to let him know
that his grief was real and that we could end the video
right then and there if he didn't want to continue. - We're not pullin' the plug on this.
- Yeah? I can't let him down. I'm doing this for myself,
and now it’s for Coach, too. To honor his mentor and friend,
Coach Wall, Majd refused to take on another
trainer for his next challenge. And in the days leading up to
the money walk, he gave every ounce of strength
he had in every single workout. This is exactly why I thought that
for Majd’s next milestone, it was only fitting that I give him
something to honor his dear friend. Before we do
the day 100 challenge, I wanted to give you something
a little special that you can put up
on the wall. Oh, man. Incredible human being. I'm so grateful that I got to,
you know, spend time with him. Where do you want to put up
your wall plaque? Literally right at the door. Coach! How are ya? Just looking up
at this, it’s just gonna be my motivation
moving forward. - Thanks, Jimmy.
- No problem. Let's go weigh in and
see how much weight Majd has lost. One hundred days ago,
Majd weighed 324 pounds. And now…
let's see what he weighs. You've lost over 50 pounds! Yeah! Meaning, Majd is officially
halfway through the challenge! Only one thing
left to do! Let's see how much money
Majd can carry. We have $100,000
that you could win. That was not supposed to fall. Remember, you can carry as
much or as little as you want, but if you drop any of it,
you walk away with nothing. Ok. How's it feel? It feels good. I mean,
it feels pretty light. He’s now got 15 grand. One more?
Ok, one more. This one on my arm. All right, that's $40,000.
We pushin’ for 50? Nah. $40,000. - This is all for Coach Wall.
- Come on. When you're ready,
cross the start line. Let's do it. - Let's go, man.
- All right, he's off. Come on, Majd,
you got this. All right, he's cooking Bro, he is running
with that thing! $40,000. Don't pass out on us. Claw! Chandler, don't let him
touch the red line. I'll push you over
before that happens. For Coach Wall! Quarter of
the way done. If a single bag, a single dollar,
touches the pavement… Dollar! you lose all 40 grand. Wait, are the bags closed? - Yeah?
- Most of em'. No! Hey, you need a break?
You can just put the money down. - No. No break.
- Yeah, yeah. Keep going. Three quarters of the way. I feel pretty tired! Are you gonna pass out? You’re almost there!
Less than 10 steps! Cross it! He did it! Your prize pool has now
increased to $321,000. Let’s go! Time to make it rain, baby! Adding it to the pot. Yeah! Do you remember on day 1,
how long it took you to run a mile? 17:01… One mile. Dang. For our next challenge, if you can do a mile in under
8 minutes and 30 seconds, aka, half of your
one mile time, I'll add another $25,000 to
your prize pool. I'll see ya in 30 days. You have
a lot of time you need to shave off. Bro, 8 minutes and 30 seconds
sounds easy, but that's hard. We’re gonna get through it, though.
We’re gonna give it our all. Majd started training immediately. I have to get
a baseline today. I'm gonna find out how long it takes
for you to run a mile. The challenge is
8 minutes and 30 seconds. We're aiming for anywhere around
like a 10 minute, 11 minute mile. I’m done. Good Lord. Oh, damn. I just ran my first mile,
12 minutes and 50 seconds. My legs are on fire. Means I have to shave
5 minutes. It’s gonna be tough. This is strictly cardio, something
that I only do 2 times a week. And the cardio that I do
2 times a week isn't even this. Majd looked like
he was struggling, so I thought I'd check in to share
something that might help. When Shopify heard about
your weight loss journey, they decided they wanted
to help out. Inside is a bunch of gear to help you
train to get under 8.5 minutes. Actual running shoes,
more supplements, an actual track suit, better clothes,
better gear. Here's some balls.
Do you get the point? This thing is loaded with things
to help get your mile time down. And they're all from businesses
built on Shopify. Thanks, Shopify! Your race is in 20 days. Shopify, me, and millions of people
are rooting for you. - Let's go!
- Get that time under 8.5 minutes! Majd wasted no time in running with
his new gear and he even had
some other ideas. Let's go! Come on, man.
You got this! Don't let me beat you. The mile’s ours! I'm honestly not sure if
that helped, but Majd seemed more
fired up than ever. And we were all starting to see
a difference in him. - Majd-eroni!
- What up, baby! I noticed something,
your clothes are a little baggy. Wait! No way. Yeah, put the banana down. We got you clothes
one size smaller. When Majd started this video,
he was a three XL. When you put these on,
you'll officially be just an XL. Damn! Congrats.
10 days. We'll see if you can
do the mile. Majd wasted no time in
getting to work. And other than yelling across
to our prison set where a cop and a criminal
are trapped together, - Hey, yo!
- Yo! He completely locked in. But his victory was
far from guaranteed. - It’s day 130!
- Come on man! Come on! Are you ready? Yeah! Think I gotta change… This is the first time in 130 days
I've seen him not in a white shirt. When we started this video,
it took you 17 minutes to run a mile. And now,
130 days later. You must do it in under
8 minutes and 30 seconds. Are you ready? Come on! 3, 2, 1… Go! 25 grand on the line. Let's see if
he can do it. Let's go! One out of seven
laps down. Majd is flying through his
second lap. It's amazing to see how far he's come
in only 130 days. When Majd didn't know where to start
his weight loss journey, I helped him just like Shopify
helps entrepreneurs when they don't know how to start
a brand new business. Remember at the
start of this video when you didn't know how to begin
your weight loss journey? Absolutely. That's how it can feel for
brand new entrepreneurs and exactly why Shopify exists
to help them start their businesses. Don't quit on us!
Let's go! Shopify literally helped me launch
Feastables with an online business. I had no idea how to set up a store,
fulfill orders, but thanks to Shopify,
we've sold millions of bars. Water, water!
Go! Ah, thanks! Hurry up, Majd!
You're running out of time! There's only
2 minutes remaining. His pacing has slowed down
tremendously. We don't have enough time.
We have to run with him. Last lap!
Majd dig deep! We’re coming with you! To those of you
watching at home, go start the business that
you've been dreaming of. Go to Shopify.com/MrBeast. Starting an online business.
It's easier than you think. You're almost there! Come on! Go! Let's go! I can’t believe it! Majd you did it in
8 minutes and 4 seconds. Congrats, Majd! Thanks Jimmy! You show up for me,
I show up for you! - Who’d you show up for?
- Coach Wall. He shows up for me every day.
I show up for him every day. Congrats on 25 grand! But more importantly, let's go see
how much weight you’ve lost. Come on! Turn off the lights! On day 1, he weighed
324 pounds. On day 30, he weighed
303 pounds. On day 60, he weighed
286 pounds. On day 100, he weighed
271 pounds. And now,
reveal his weight! That’s 71 pounds since the start! All right. Ok, don’t hurt him! Maybe at the end of the video,
we'll lift you up. When you started, you were able to
dead hang for 6 seconds. In exactly 30 days,
for every second you can hang, I will give you $1,000. Get out of here. And truthfully, because your
hang time was… …awful. I brought someone who
literally trains bodybuilders. This guy has a degree
in biochemistry and is the smartest fitness
influencer I could find, Jeff Nippard. Let's go! All right, he just did
the whole mile thing. He's on adrenaline. I personally think you can do
a pull-up. I wanted to do a pull-up
my whole entire life. Just one single pull-up. If you can do it,
I'll throw in an extra 10K. - No way.
- I got you. In 30 days? Wait Majd, you can win
a lot of money. These next 30 days
are important. Yeah, they are.
They're crucial. And to celebrate
crushing the mile, Majd and Jeff sat down to share
a little something special. - The Feastables cups!
- Let's go. This is something that I really
wanted to have. You deserve it.
You earned it. This is a big moment for me, guys. Cheers, brother. That's some good stuff. This peanut butter is like
real peanut butter. Right?
So good. It was clear that in order to
dead hang for a minute, let alone do
a singular pull-up, Majd would have to alter his
training plan significantly to focus on
upper-body strength. - Take your grip.
- Ok. And then this is gonna really
kinda shoot you up. Does that make sense? So it's giving you
a lot of assistance. Ok. Jeff! I'm so sorry. The main goal for me
is to finish this, lose the 100 pounds, and just make sure that the world can
hopefully see Coach's impact. I'm crushing dead hang! In only 3 days, Jeff really helped
Majd improve his dead hang, which was not looking good
for my bank account. This guy is an animal. Do you wanna guess
what it was? It’s probably like
37 seconds. 45? No way. It’s not even the end
of the first week! Let's go! With Majd now
set up for success, Jeff left it up to him to prepare
over the next 27 days. This is where the real challenge
starts, right? Now I’m all alone. On his own now, Majd was really
starting to see his body improve. I can feel these chisels. He started locking in on everything,
from his workouts… You saw that? Eating only
1800 calories a day… We just switched over to
1800 calories. And even having a strict
sleeping schedule. 10 o’clock food cut-off,
sleep by 12. So for the remainder of training for
the dead hang challenge, Majd really was set up
for success. Chalked up. I gotta do 3 sets of dead hangs,
10 to 20 seconds Every single day,
he improved his hang time. Day of the challenge,
when it comes down to it… we’re going till like,
my thumbs actually fall off. I'm so close! It really just
goes to show that when you put your mind
to something, anything is possible. Doing pull-ups, running miles in
under 8 minutes and 30 seconds, carryin' a bunch of money around,
doing 40 pushups straight. Such an incredible story. Game day tomorrow, baby! Day 161.
Let's see how Majd is doing. Drive! Why’s it stuck?
Bro, I’m literally flooring it. Majd! - It’s weigh-in day!
- What the— I think you
broke the door. Bro! It's the big day!
Are you ready? - Uh yeah, I'm ready, man.
- This is gonna be awesome. To kick things off, we're gonna see
how much you weigh. My theory is you're actually pretty
close to finishing the challenge. I feel like it. And then second, we're gonna
dangle you 100 feet in the air. What? And every second you hang,
you win $1,000. Ok. Hold on. - Dangled from a crane?
- Hey! Don't worry about it. - Let's weigh in.
- Oh, man. What do you think that
number will say? 246. Majd has done
10,000 steps a day. Followed his diet perfectly. Not skipped a single rep on
his workouts. Hop on. Let's go! 3, 2, 1… Reveal the weight! 234 pounds! What? No way! - No! No!
- Yeah! You only have 10 more pounds to lose,
and then this video is over. If you play your
cards right, you could be out of here
in the next 30 days. Thanks, Jimmy. All right, but now
you need to lock in. Come on! Let’s go outside. Today we find out how long
I can dead hang for. I have no idea what
Jimmy has in store for me. All I know is there's a crane,
a platform, and a bar for me to
hang from. 100 feet in the sky and
$1,000 for every second you can hang. Majd, are you ready? 3, 2, 1… Here we go. All right, the time
has started. 4 seconds,
5 seconds… Hey Majd,
look down! - Oh my gosh, does that scare you?
- Not at all. Oh, my— Wait, get a shot of this.
This is real. Look at that.
15 seconds has gone by. You've already doubled
your first time. Majd has now won
$20,000. - This is light work for you, bro.
- Do not quit! You're almost there, Majd.
You're almost there, brother. You're the one that's going to
accomplish this! 30 seconds! Focus on your breath.
Don't listen to Jimmy. His hands are giving out.
His face is getting red. Don't regret this! Bro, do you think I'm not
watching you? 40 seconds! I got eyes on you
at all times. Keep pushing.
Don't stop. 50 seconds! You don't have to follow
your diet plan. You don't have to stay inside
this red circle. You don't need to do
anything. You don't even need to do this,
but you're choosing to do this. Let's go, Majd! Your prize pool's now 400 grand.
His arms are shaking. You're almost there. I can't open
my eyes. 60 seconds! The hardest part of
all this, obviously, is the connection that
I had with Coach. It sucks that, like,
it was so close. Oh, he just dropped. A minute! It was—
Oh my God. The entire platform. 6 seconds to
60 seconds. That's 10X! Hello?
That's $60,000! - I'm so proud of you, man.
- Let’s go, man! You officially made it
a minute and one second. Let's go! But we're not stopping there.
Because as you'll remember… If he could do a pull-up,
I'd throw in an extra 10K. Let's go, man. - You ready?
- I'm ready. Big breath. And then you're gonna drive as
hard as you can, chest to the bar. Let's go! Let's go! Can you do another one? Wait, 3. Wait, he doesn’t
need help! Let’s go! No way! Let's go fill up
the prize pool. I've never seen Majd
this happy before. I told you I was gonna
break the bank today! There we go. $71,000 has now been added
to the prize pool. What the heck? I know you're on cloud nine.
Arguably the best day of your life. But I do have to give
some bad news. That was the final challenge. No, losing 100 pounds was
the final challenge. Ok, yes, but that's the final
micro-challenge. - Ok.
- So… - We'll start weighing you every day.
- Let's go! And when you officially lose the next
10 pounds, video's over. All right.
Good luck, man. Thanks, Jimmy. Majd has only 10 pounds
left to lose. So at this point,
it had become clear that he was on track to hit his goal
weight within the next month. So it started out 250,000.
Now it's at 417,000. It was actually insane. Now that it's my final 10 pounds,
we are coming to an end man. These may be my last
few weeks in here. It's definitely
a bittersweet feeling. It's kind of crazy how far we've come
in less than 6 months. It's like I look at myself like,
who is this person? If my old self walked through
that door right there, right now, he'd be like,
""Who is this?"" I've seen the seasons change
while I've been in here. Bro! Look at that! I've been inside of a red circle,
basically away from everything. I'm just, I’m so grateful.
So thankful for the experience. Coach being the biggest impact
of this whole thing. God rest his soul. I know he'd be
proud of me. He said this one thing, ""It’s so cool that we
get to do this together."" While Coach gave Majd all the tools
he needed to lose 100 pounds, when he does finally
leave the circle, it will be up to him to apply what
he's learned to his everyday life. The journey’s
almost over— Sike. The journey’s
almost over in here. The real journey starts
on the outside. I have the clothes that I wore when
I first got in here. I'm gonna try 'em on. Let's just say…
we lost a little bit of weight. Bro, look how baggy
these are. Seeing Majd trying on his old clothes
gave me an idea. What if he could try on
his old body? This is a bodysuit that is
a 1-to-1 replica of Majd on day 1. No joke, we scanned
your body, saw exactly where you lost fat,
and created this suit. Bro, there’s no way
this is me. That's literally another
human being. - Let's put it on.
- I gotta wear this? 175 days ago,
you wore this every day. This is crazy! I wanna see myself
real quick. Oh my God! No way! This fat suit weighs exactly
97 pounds. He is now back at
his starting weight. You probably forgot what life used to
feel like. Let's do a lap. I hope this helps
you realize how much you’ve changed
throughout this video. Alright, let's try a lap. Here's footage of him actually
running a lap on day 1. If you think he's being dramatic,
go pick up 97 pounds, and you'll see, that's a lot of weight to
have on your body. There you go. You like your day 1 body,
or your day 175 body? Of course,
my day 175 body. Since we're weighing
Majd every day, we were seeing him get
closer and closer, until he was only a half a pound away
from his goal of 224 pounds. - Oh my God, dude.
- You have no idea how close you are. Wait, wait, wait.
Can I turn around? Seeing just how far Majd had come
from his old self made it pretty clear
to everyone that it was probably time to do
his final weigh in. Today could be my last day. It's crazy. 6 months.
Half a year. Today could be the day
all the hard work paid off. Or we're still half a pound away. Over these 6 months, Majd slashed his
daily caloric intake by 600 calories, decreased his fat mass
by over 50%. He also did 3,950 pushups and
made 17,600 basketball shots. And according to his doctor,
if he keeps this up, he'll have increased his lifespan
by around 5 years. But before we know if
this is his final weigh in, we have a message from Majd,
from himself. This is actually a video from
day 1. Play it. Majd, you're looking lean.
You're looking healthy. You're looking bald.
Beautiful as ever. But most importantly,
you don't wanna go back to what you're
looking at now. This is something that you never
wanna feel again. Once you break
that barrier, you continue to push on and
push through, you'll never wanna get
back to this. This is something that you're gonna
do for the rest of your life. I'm not gonna let you fall off. 100% 178 days ago. Dang, bro.
That's crazy. Majd, it's time. I gathered all your best friends,
even David Letterman. David Letterman! Yeah! He told me he's a fan of his show
so I brought him out. Good luck! This could be the
final weigh in. - Ok.
- The last time. Reveal the results! Let's go! And before he goes out
to see his family, we're gonna do something a little
different and jump forward in time to show you his
full transformation. Here it is.
After half a year. Wait… Yo! Bro! I might get married. I might get married! 178 days in
this circle. Take your hand off
your eyes. We brought your family out! Oh, I love you, mom! You know, without Coach Wall I
wouldn't have been able to do this. And he said it would be so cool that
we get to do this together. And today is that day that
we get to do this together. Thank you guys
for watching!",unknown
ZGvn9ywXjpY,"Reese's cups versus our new Fastables peanut butter cups. Let's see which one Gordon Ramsay likes better. Keep your eyes closed. I'm going to mix them up. All right, reach in front of you and just grab one of them. He's sniffing it. That smells rich. Super smooth. Now try the other one. This is rough. Doesn't really taste like an authentic peanut butter. It's like dry on the palette and the chocolate's sort of disintegrating. By far the one I'd go to again would be the first one. Oh, let's go. Thank you.",unknown
hTSaweR8qMI,"We're going on some of the most
expensive dates in the world. Like this $500,000 date that includes the
entirety of Disneyland, all for ourselves… a $100,000 date at this mega complex with
a massive waterpark and indoor ski resort… a $50,000 private island date… Best date ever! a $10,000 date cooked by Gordon Ramsay… and we even convinced
superstar singer Madison Beer to go on a date with
my most awkward friend. All starting with this $1 date:
a Ferris Wheel! - Here's $1.
- Ok. - Ladies first.
- Thank you. Take notes, men. Is this safe? I see why it's only $1.
The $1 date has now begun. It's, uh, making a lot of noise. Why is it making that noise? It's just the wind, right? I usually film 20, 25 days a month, and I don't really get to
spend much time with my fiancee, so I literally picked this video so me and
my fiancee could spend more time together. I love you, even if you
didn't take me to Disneyland. Well… not yet. But for the final date in this video,
for the first time in history, Disney reserved
the whole park just for us. That's it for the $1 date! Let's head out to the $10,000 dinner date—
After you, babe. Turn off the park.
I'll see you guys there. And now, the $10,000 date where we're gonna be recreating
our first-ever date with sushi. - After you.
- Thank you. She doesn't know this, but Gordon Ramsay's
gonna be making us the meal for this date. Thank you. There you go.
You look really cute. I picked this just for you. It's been a long time since my first date
with Thea, and now that we're engaged, I'm really excited to explore the world's
most expensive dates with my fiancee. You're probably wondering,
""Why is this the $10,000 date?"" Why is it? Gordon Ramsay himself
is gonna be cooking our meals. The Gordon Ramsay? Yep. Come on in. Welcome to Lucky Cat Miami! It's nice meeting you! How's it going? What an amazing night
this is gonna be. Oh, I'm excited. Yes. We're gonna kick off with some pea
guacamole with some delicious crackers. Did you say peacock? I said pea guac! Oh, pea guac, oh… Not peacock, babe. To celebrate this $10,000 dinner,
some seriously exclusive sushi. Ladies first. Cheers. Yeah, this is good. We have a delicious gourmet fried chicken,
wonderful fried rice, and duck bao buns. Duck tacos? Bao buns! Duck tacos. Bao buns! You can yell at me. I will do in a minute.
You're pushin' my limits, man. Enjoy. I want you to take the first bite. I knew you were gonna do that. It's only the $10,000 date, and we already have the world's best chef
cooking a romantic dinner for the 2 of us. Nothing could possibly
ruin this moment. Chef. What are you guys
doin' here? No, no no, no. - I got you.
- Come on, man! Don't rip it! I'm not ripping it, chef!
I'm not ripping it! Oh my goodness, mate. Why are you disrespecting
his restaurant? This is supposed to be
a romantic dinner! Nolan, mine's burning. That's it.
I'm done! What are you? An idiot sandwich! That is worth 10K alone. You guys have turned it
to a nightmare! For $10,000, Gordon had a romantic
surprise for our final course. This is nice!
This is romantic! This is actually
very romantic. Aww. Thank you. This 10K date was amazing. I can't imagine how insane these dates
are gonna get later in the video. The $50,000 date is this
entire private island, so me and Thea brought some friends with
us to make this a quadruple date. Wait, what?
What is that? This is Tom,
the turkey. Please tell me we're
not eating Tom. We are not eating Tom. I didn't know if this was like a
Say-Hi-To-Your-Dinner thing as you arrive. We have this entire $50,000 island
and everything on it to ourselves. I say the best way to kick off
an island date is to go jet skiing! Let's go! Best date ever! You might recognize Grizz and Hase from the video where they spent 74 days in
the wilderness together. The day I took that hood off and saw you
was the best day of my life! And you saw these two when Josh spent
22 days in solitary confinement. These three spent weeks away
from their wives, so I thought I'd give them
some quality time together. This is the best date
we've ever been on! Does the wife approve? I approve! This is how I make good with
all the people I put in prolonged places. Oh my gosh,
that was so close! Hey, Jimmy! It’s Nolan! Yo! Uh-oh,
we're bouncin'. Nolan is flying solo for this date, but later on, he'll be going on
a date with Madison Beer. I, uh—
the great outfit… Everyone, the island is all yours.
Go do whatever you want! So we all enjoyed the luxuries of
this $50,000 island date. All right everyone,
heads up! Like hitting golf balls that are also
fish food right into the ocean. - Thea, you show me how it’s done.
- I actually don't know how to do this. Now we're getting couples' massages
on the beach. There is just a person on my back.
Very relaxing. Grizz and Hase were playing
some beach volleyball… against their wives, of course. And Josh and Kenna were having
a picnic on the beach. I forgive you for taking him away
from me for so long. - Welcome in, guys.
- Oh wait, there's rose petals. I mean, I laid those
just for you. For 50 grand, we all get these
luxurious bungalows. Where do the petals lead? I mean, look where
the petals lead. Into the lovely master suite. I made a heart just for you. It is so pretty.
And you picked them yourself? - Oh, I made this myself.
- Wow. And as the sun was setting on
this $50,000 date… To our loved one! Cheers! …Nolan was the only one
at dinner without a date. Until Tom the turkey showed up. Nolan, we found you a partner! Uh, I'm all good on Tom. And after dinner,
we did some couples dancing. Rate our dance move. Again. Got it? Come on! And after dark, we had a beach campfire,
and I had a surprise for everyone. Cue the fireworks show! And lightning at the same time! - Nolan, your date showed up!
- Tom the Turkey! Yo, why are you standin' so still? That's it for the $50,000 date!
I'll see you guys at the next one. For double the cost of
the previous date, we get this massive indoor metropolis
all to ourselves. There's a giant theme park, the largest indoor
water park in America, even its own
weather control system so they can have the largest indoor
ski slope in America. Ooh, it's so cool. This is terrifying! And while Thea loves skiing… I haven't told her… I have no idea how to ski. Babe, this is massive! You're scared?
Don’t be scared. I'm not scared. Nah. You're good. Hey, what's over there? - What?
- I'm freakin' terrified. - What did you say?
- I'm excited! Ok, you got it? Babe, grab the straight— Babe, stop! How do I stop? Babe, I'm starting to think
that you don't know how to ski. No, I—
I know how to ski. - How do I stand up?
- I got you. Ah! Oh, no. Babe, stop! Babe, help! Thea, make me stop. Ok. I got you. How do I stop? Legs together! Legs closed, legs closed! What, are they not closed? Yeah, skiing is so much fun. Anyways, let's move on with the date! With so much to explore in
this shopping metropolis, it felt like doing ten dates in one! From winning prizes in an arcade… …getting a hole-in-one
in mini golf… - Look at that!
- Yeah! …or building each other
custom teddy bears. I love it. And where I normally do these kinds of
videos by myself or with my friends, doing this with the person I love most
was kind of magical. Being able to do pretty much anything
you could ever want to do on a date— It felt like being a kid in a candy store
…literally! Ooh, chocolate. Whoa. What is this? Uh. Hey, ma'am?
What is this? They're Hershey's. Can we replace these with Feastables? Sure. Ok. Oh! Much better! If you haven’t already,
try Feastables. It's the best-tasting chocolate
on the planet. Let's keep the date going. We now have an entire waterpark
to ourselves, and we just wanna take
a relaxing swim together. Isn't it crazy that we're
in the middle of a mall? It's like as big as the ocean. Up next, we actually got Madison Beer to
go on a date with Nolan. Do you think Nolan has a chance with her? We're about to find out. For the $250,000 date,
Madison Beer, the two-time Grammy nominee,
platinum-selling artist, with over 3.5 billion streams worldwide, is going on a date with… my awkward friend Nolan. - Hello!
- Hey. - Great to meet you.
- How are you? Nice to meet you. And while Nolan is on his date with
Madison Beer, me and Tareq are currently
tucked away in the bathroom with a walkie that communicates
directly to a mic in Nolan's ear. Where are you from? - I'm from Long Island.
- New York? Yes. Where are you from? Nebraska. Not much
out there besides corn. - Cool.
- Yeah. No, he's talking about corn! In this seven years I've known Nolan,
I have never seen him this nervous before. So to help Nolan out, I spent $250,000
on Madison's dream date. From driving her favorite car,
getting VIP treatment at an MLB game, and an over-the-top sushi dinner, all to give Nolan the best shot of
securing a second date. Tell her you like her outfit. A great outfit. Thank you. We told the waiter to help us
wingman Nolan. I'll be your server.
Welcome to Bar Siesta. You guys look amazing.
I like your shoes my man. Dude, thank you. But it was quickly clear
that it wasn't working. How's the weather? How's the weather? Cool. He’s falling apart. Nolan is not used to talking
to attractive women. - You've watched the videos before?
- I watch all the videos. What's your favorite video? The one where they were underground
for 100 days. Madison Beer watches our videos. I never expected that. Same. I don't really eat meat. Vegan?
Vegetarian? Pescatarian,
'cause I love sushi. They're getting to know each other,
this is nice. - Sorry, I just got lost in your eyes.
- Aw, that's so sweet. Ohh, he hit it! He took the shot! I was staring into the abyss.
I don't… - Oh, not my eyes?
- No. As they finished eating,
I had one last idea to help Nolan. I want you to tip the waiter $10,000.
My card is in your wallet. That guy was so nice.
I think we should tip $10,000. I would love nothing more. - Nolan has a gift for you.
- We left a little something for you. Wait, are you guys serious? - Thank you.
- I appreciate it. - Here are the keys.
- Thank you. Let's hit it. Madison really loves animals, so their
next stop on their date is an animal farm. Nolan's only problem now was that
the petting zoo was an hour drive away. Me and Tareq are still listening in. What's it like going up in front of
thousands and thousands of people? I just love my fans. They're the reason I get to do
stuff like this and live my dreams. He's warming up and
he's getting better with time. We made it to the second part of the date. The Gentle Barn, a sanctuary that
rescues abused animals. What made you start loving
animals so much? I have a lot of anxiety, and I feel like
they just are a calming reminder of peace. I feel a sense of calm around you. You are smooth with it. But visiting animals wasn't the only thing
on our agenda. They're gonna give you guys $25,000, and I'm actually going to match them,
and I’m gonna give you another 25,000. And then it was time for me to ask
an important question. You two ready to head to
an Angels baseball game? - Let's do it.
- Sure am. Do you mind if me and my fiancee join you
guys for the next part of the date? Am I allowed to say no? No, 'cause I paid for it. I mean, you paid for it, right? And then we had an entire suite to
ourselves at an Angels game. This view of the game is insane. We got custom jerseys with
our names on the back. And after almost all of us
made it on the jumbotron… a crowd began forming around us. You'll be in a video, say ""Hi."" Anyways, we should probably head to
the next part of this date. And for the final part of
the $250,000 date— What are we
doing, Nolan? Sushi dinner and an ice skating rink with
some of the best sushi chefs on the earth. I can definitely say I've never
done anything like this. I gotcha, I gotcha. Thank you, Jimmy. Tonight we prepared for you all
a tasting menu. How much does this
amount of fish cost? A couple thousand. How do you think we got up to
the 250K price tag? Definitely looks like
my type of bite of sushi. Oh my God. - That is so good.
- Wow. And then we all enjoyed some of the best
sushi I've ever had in my entire life. This is the best date ever. - Thanks, Nolan.
- Anytime. The 250K date, I think we could all agree,
was a lot of fun. Nolan, you had a question
you wanted to ask. I do. Oh, God. Oh, Jesus. Oh, God. My shoe was just untied. Would you like to go on a second date to
Disneyland with me? Yes. Let's head on over! And now it is time for the most expensive
grand finale date. We have Disneyland all to ourselves! This is gonna be awesome.
Let's go ride some rides! Disney won't just hand over
their keys to anyone, but for this once-in-a-lifetime date, we were given the entire park
for one night. And with so much to do,
we had to bring the boys, our friends from the island,
and of course… Madison and Nolan. Yo, once we’re at the top,
this is gonna have a crazy view. But our first stop is this
absolutely insane Star Wars ride. All right, that's cool. Holy smokes!
Look how big this is! Normally, people can wait
hours for this ride, but my friends and I walked right in. Yo, strap in. All right, who's ready for
the Star Wars ride? Is now a bad time to mention
I haven't seen the movies? What? This is crazy!
How did Disney build all this? This is wild. Oh my Gosh. Nolan, protect Madison! Yo, can you believe we're
doing this right now? Yeah, this is insane! - That was awesome.
- Once in a lifetime! This is crazy! That was amazing! Every other cart was empty.
We have this whole place to ourselves. Disneyland is awesome! That was sick! And after that ride,
what could be cooler… …than building your own lightsaber? Oh, yeah!
Coolest lightsaber! Up next, we're all gonna ride
this giant Ferris Wheel. We're back to where
this video started. You could say it went full circle. I've never been on a Ferris Wheel
that looks like that! Yeah, this is massive! It feels like we're stepping into
an old movie. Come on in, babe. This is like the $1 date,
but in Disneyland and much bigger. Much bigger! You can see the entire
park up here. Wow! How does this compare to
our $1 date? I mean, it's so much better. It's very romantic here in Disney. Wonder what Nolan and
Madison are doing. Fist bump. Let's go. Things are not looking good for
Nolan right now. I can't wait to
play games. Yeah, that sounds fun. - Are you gonna win me something?
- Of course. Yay! Are you gonna win me something? Oh, you betcha! Let's go! With his eye on the prize,
Nolan challenged me and Chandler to a friendly competition. This is what you're
competing for. - A worm? Babe, do you want that worm?
- Yes, I really want it. Ok, boys, I'm gonna
have to win this one. - All right, I wanna win this for you.
- Please. 3, 2, 1… Go! - Nolan!
- First one, first one. Let's go! It's, like, curving. Two! That's two! You need three to win. This is the grand prize.
It's all yours. For you. You can feel the tension in
the air right now. Gah, come here! But you know I couldn't lose to
Nolan like that. Yes! Yes! Oh my goodness! Let's run it back! Yes! - Yay!
- Here y’go, babe. The Three P.
Here we go! We won again! That was fun! It's fun winning. There are no words to describe how special
it is to have Disneyland all to ourselves. And I think we all made memories
that are gonna last a lifetime. Whoa, babe.
There's a puddle. You're a gentleman! No wet feet for you. Take notes, boys. And to wrap things up,
we have one final surprise. We're gonna be eating dinner in
front of the Disney castle. - Oh my!
- What? All right, I don't know why Disney's going
all out for us, but thank you guys. - Oh my gosh.
- Wow! - This is crazy.
-This is beautiful! Everyone, come on, sit down. Cheers to the greatest date in history. Cheers! Yes! This was an awesome night.
I'm glad I can enjoy it with all of you. Cheers! Of all the dates I took you on,
which one was your favorite? Definitely this one. Yeah? Yeah, ‘cause everybody's here.
We should do this more! Rent all of Disneyland? Yeah. That was awesome. And to wrap up the video,
for the first time in Disney's history, they're going to do a private parade
for all of us. Let's head on over. I gotta say, this date is gonna be
so hard to top. Huge thanks to Disney for absolutely
blowing our minds with this experience. This was truly a once in a lifetime. If you don't have notifications on,

can beat him in a 1V1, I'm gonna give him
half a million dollars. I also got the greatest shooter
in basketball, the strongest hitter
in baseball, That is gone! and the most famous athletes on the planet
all competing against normal people. Starting with Serena Williams, the greatest female tennis player
to ever live. And she will be competing against… Bring ‘em on in! …these four quadruplets. Hi. Oh my goodness. If one of you can return a serve
from Serena Williams, I will give you guys $100,000. But if you can't, we'll be donating it
to a charity of her choice. You girls can do it. - We got this.
- Easy! Alright, it's now time. Here we go. Serena Williams serves a tennis ball
faster than any woman on earth. So good luck, quadruplets! Oh! It literally went past all of them. I’m sorry! - It's ok.
- You killed us. I'm gonna send this to
Yetunde Price Resource Center, so really
excited about it. And what I'm really excited about is that
we have Steph Curry and Neymar later in this video. But right now we have a 1V1 with
a different basketball all-star… And for our next 1V1,
we have Giannis, the Greek Freak! A nine time All-Star,
two-time MVP, and NBA champion. Versus Tristan,
your typical basketball player. Let's get it baby. First one of you to make a layup, free
throw, three pointer, and half court shot wins this $100,000. I’m about to win all this money. Let's see if an average guy can beat
an NBA champion. 3, 2, 1… Go! Let's see who wins. - Wait, he made it.
- It's a race. Pass me the rock. Hey help him out,
Nolan! Let's get it. Tristan's already halfway to 100K. Gotta hit your free throw,
Giannis. I'm ready. Oh, Giannis missed!
He missed! Oh, he hit the three! He’s going to
half court! Come on. Giannis! Giannis!
What is happening? No way.
If he makes it— Tristan only needs a half court
to win it all. - Giannis, it’s just a free throw.
- I'm ready. That's it! Alright, Giannis made
his free throw. He's an NBA champion. He's clutch.
He's gonna come back. Go for it! That happened so fast! This is crazy. Let’s go! I'm so salty right now. You said you’re,
he’s salty— - Man, I'm so salty right now.
- Look at his face. He’s so mad! Come on, man This guy came to Milwaukee and
left with 100,000 in this pocket. Wow. - You good?
- I'm good. Don't drown in
the money. Well since the Greek Freak
couldn’t beat an Average Joe, let's see if another
basketball legend can. For our next 1V1, we have
the greatest shooter on the planet: Steph Curry! Leading the NBA with
the most three pointers of all time, no human in history has shot a basketball
better than Steph Curry. Which is why he is going to be
going up against the number one shooter in
this high school. You ready to have some fun? - Yeah!
- Alright! The game is simple. We're gonna give Steph Curry 30 seconds
to make as many threes as he can. Demarrion will then have 60 seconds
to try to beat his score. If he does,
we will give him $100,000. If he loses, we'll give it to
whatever charity Steph Curry wants us to. Who do you like more,
Steph Curry or LeBron James? - LeBron.
- So he's a 'Bron guy? Oh my gosh. You shouldn’t piss him off
before you go against him. I like it. Alright. Head on over
to the corner. Let's see why he's the greatest
three point shooter to ever live. 3, 2, 1… Go! Oh my gosh.
Oh, he's just not missing. Oh, he missed! Alright, he missed one. 20 seconds left. Half the time has now gone by. Ok, only eight so far. He's onto rack three.
There's only 10 seconds left. Oh, he missed! 3, 2, 1… Time’s up,
time’s up! 14 shots in 30 seconds. Come on! Come on! Let's see if Demarrion
can beat that. And obviously, since he's just
a high schooler, he'll have twice as much time
as Steph Curry. I really wanna
see him do this. Will Demarrion, in front of
his whole high school, win this life-changing $100,000? Let's find out. Let’s go! 3, 2, 1… Go! 100 grand on the line. It's alright.
Don't give up yet. Remember, you still have
double the time. Alright,
he made one. 100 bands, man.
Lock in! Alright, he's starting
to ease into it. Yes! He still has half a minute left. Alright, Demarrion, you're still in this
and you have 20 seconds left. Hey, who's gonna win? Steph Curry! Alright, he’s gotta hit
all these. Come on. 3, 2, 1… Last shot! Come on! And that's Demarrion 9.
Steph Curry 14. That was an honor, man.
How'd that feel? All right. - Is, like, your heart going crazy?
- Yeah. Steph, what charity do you want us
to donate this $100,000 to? The Eat.Learn.Play. Foundation, so it's gonna go to a great,
great, great, great cause. Let's go film with one of the most elite
racecar drivers on Earth. For our next 1V1, we have two-time
Formula champion Dan Ticktum. ""Dan Ticktum!"" And he's gonna be racing Ronnie. And obviously Ronnie
is not an FE driver, so he has to do three laps
before Dan does four. If you win, I will give you $100,000. And if you win, I'll donate $100,000 to
whatever charity you want. My charity. It's coming to me, baby.
It's coming to me. How much money have
you lost in our videos? 750K. We about to make it 850K? Well, we'll see.
I hope so. Redemption! These two will be strapped into
two of the fastest-accelerating single-seater cars on the planet. Out of the billions of cars on Earth,
nothing launches faster than these. And we're just giving it to
my friend to drive. I'm not listening. Anything that’s gonna
make me scared. I'm just driving. No joke, while doing a test lap
for this video, I slammed into the wall at
multiple Gs of force, so I don't blame him. Pray for me, mama. $100,000 on the line! - Dan, are you ready?
- Yeah. Ronnie, are you ready? Let's do it, bro. 3, 2, 1… Go! Oh, Ronnie actually
got a faster start. Now Ronnie’s
getting destroyed. He’s obliterating him! Yo! This is crazy. Dan is already significantly
ahead of Ronnie. - Here they come.
- There it is! Oh, he's going so fast. Dan is smoking him! While Ronnie's playing it safe,
Dan's literally going 200 miles an hour. Even with the handicap,
Dan might blow him out. These things are fast, man. Dan's coming around the turn,
we're about to see him on the stretch. Alright, there he is. And Dan's done with lap one. Oh my gosh. That sounds like a fighter jet. So that was Dan. And Ronnie…
Ronnie is very far behind. Where’s Ronnie?
I'm coming, I'm coming. Ronnie's finally completed his first lap. There he is! You’re doing good! He's not doing good. Faster! What is he doing? Bro, that's the straightaway. - Ronnie.
- I hear you, Jimmy. What’s up, bro? Ronnie, you're getting destroyed. Oh, that was a bad turn. How fast are you guys going? 112… That's already Dan’s second lap,
and Ronnie's just finished his first. Speed it up! I'm pushing the throttle
all the way down, baby. He’s about to lap you, Ronnie. C'mon baby,
we can do this! Go faster! I’m coming, baby. Ronnie, don’t make this so easy! I’m running like Forrest, Jimmy. I’m running like Forrest. I’m coming. Oh no! - See ya!
- Oh no, oh no! Dan's already completed
his third lap. This is not even close. Alright, I feel good.
This last lap's gonna be my best one. When Dan passes this finish line, he wins.
They're both on their final lap. Let's go! He’s already finished? What? Dan! You won! Let's go! Let's go! 100K! He's jumping in it! In front of Ronnie!
In front of you! What charity do you want to
donate this money to? Help for Heroes.
This is a UK veteran charity. Does that make you feel better, Ronnie? Yeah, I guess so, man. He’s like,
“My bank account’s a better cause.” If you thought hat was epic, just wait for
the moment later in this video when Neymar 1V1s a random guy. But for our next 1V1, I got a stadium filled with
almost 20,000 people and the greatest NBA players of all time to watch this random guy go head-to-head
with Damian Lillard, one of only three players ever to score
70+ points in a game. We're gonna see if he can make 1 shot
before Damian makes 3. If he does,
we're gonna give him $100,000. He nervous. Alright, Damian you're up first. One of the best
shooters of all time. He actually missed. Anything you want to say to everyone? First try, come on. First try, you can win
$100,000 right here. - I go whenever?
- Yeah! Go for it. That's 1 of 3. You gotta make 1 before
he makes 2 more. 100 grand! Is it game time? Alright, he's going easy on you, clearly. You hear how loud they’re getting.
They're getting hyped. Alright surely he’s gonna hit this one.
That’ll be 2 out of 3. - Just shoot as high as you can
- Yeah. Oh, ok. That's 2 out of 3. He only has to make 1 more. He did it! He did it! How's it feel to win $100,000 in
front of everyone? This is surreal.
I can't thank anybody but my dad. Thank you for the opportunity. Alright, let’s head to the next bit.
That was awesome. Up next, we have two-time MVP,
six-time All-Star, Aaron Judge. - How's it going, man?
- I'm great. And he's gonna be going head to head in
a home run derby versus… One of the greatest baseball players
the world has ever seen. He is a pitcher's worst nightmare. A Division 2 juggernaut. Aaron Judge's toughest challenge yet
will be against... Yeah! Woo!
Let's go! Chandler. - How many career home runs do you have?
- One. How many do you have? More than one. Well, 300 is a lot more
than just one. In fact, no one in
all of baseball has hit more home runs in the past 5 years
than this guy. Which is why,
to make things even, he's gonna get 10 swings and
Chandler's gonna get 20. Might need more than that. You’re supposed to be confident. I'm getting that 100 grand. - Yeah, there we go.
- I like it. This is literally the greatest hitter
in baseball right now. Chandler doesn't have a chance. Hits 1 of 10 for Aaron Judge.
100 grand on the line. Alright. Ooh, not a home run. He's oh for one. - That's money in my pocket.
- Take your time, man. No rush. Oh my God. Oh, there it goes. Oh, that is gone! - Home run, baby.
- Oh my God. 1 for 2. He won't do that again,
he won’t. Hop them up. He was aiming for
the moon with that one. Hey, throw a curve ball. Wait, I think that's warning track. That's not a home run. Where’s the wind at? He's 1 for 4. I might be able to hit one. - That might hit across.
- I think we pissed him off. Home run! Here we go. Alright, we're halfway
through, 2 for 5. You got him in the pocket. He's on fire. Hey wait a second. Ok. Thank you. I'm trying to throw him off,
you know? Pop fly. It worked. It did. Aaron, I heard you're on
T-Mobile, right? Yep. By joining T-Mobile, you instantly get
Magenta Status like me and Judge, which comes with tons of premium perks
like free in-flight WiFi, hotel discounts, and even a free subscription to MLB.TV so
you can watch more stuff like that. That's you! That counts.
That's gotta count, right? Yeah. No, of course.
Bro, he dinged the top of the fence. 4 for 8. Chandler’s counting,
so don't worry. Stop it. T-Mobile Magenta Status will also
give you the opportunity to win tickets to the World Series and discounts to
thousands of other live events. Just for being a T-Mobile member. Why were you out here? T-Mobile is so much more
than your phone carrier. If you wanna sign up, just scan
the QR code on Chandler's face. Get it. Alright, let's see
this final swing. Yes. 5 for 10. You hit 6 home runs,
I wire you $100,000. - And you get to say you beat Aaron Judge!
- Let's go! So you’re signing me to
the Yankees after. Where's my bat? Alright, swing 1 of 20. Oh my God. Wait, where did that
come from? That's you, Karl.
That’s you. I don't have
my glasses on. And he's almost
out of there. Now do that, just hit it
40 feet further. What are you doing
swinging at that? That hit off the telephone pole. Is my swing ok?
Any tips? - Oh no, no, no, no.
- What? Oh, he instantly said, ""Nah."" Dude, I'm not 6'8"".
What do you want me to do? I like my chances. Hey, you got it.
Lock in! Heads up. He's going more sideways than
over the home run fence. He's only hit 1 of the first
3 swings fair. First baseman
catches that one. Hey… That's a double in the gap. It's not what we're looking for, though. Yeah, you gotta pull it. - Hey!
- That-a-boy! That's not a home run. Oh for 6. Lots of ball game left! I'm trying to swing
out of my shoes. You're working the whole field,
which I like. Nolan, that’s you. Where is it? This is why we gave him
so many swings. That doesn't count. Alright. This is not going well.
He's oh for 11. Chandler, you gotta
start hitting 'em. No… Chandler, I'm begging you. Chandler, come on.
I gave you double the tries. By this point,
it was pretty clear that the chances of Chandler catching up
were pretty slim. Time out. I'm just a hitting machine.
Like, maybe I should just get stronger? I don’t know what do. There's 100 G's on the line.
You're oh for 13. So to make this even
somewhat of a challenge, if you hit just one home run,
I'll give each of you $100,000. I gotta step up right now. Aaron, you have any
advice for him? You thought your moment was
gonna be against me. Yeah. - Oh, that’s—
- I mean, what other chance do I have? Don’t let him do this to you! Alright, come on. We're all rooting for you. Thanks. I knew that if Big Justice could hit
5 home runs, then Chandler, the King of Clutch,
could hit just 1. Alright, pitch 14. Wait, is that it? - Hit up! Go up!
- He held it. Wait! No way. Ah, that was the
warning track. You're close. That might be it. Wait. He was so close. Next one, it’s you! - Nah, don't be swinging that high.
- It's a great swing. I appreciate it. A second earlier. No! Bad swing. Karl, that's you.
Catch it! Chandler, we just need
1 home run. That might be it. Off the wall. Alright, you have
2 swings left. Come on. Just one. I'm getting lazy.
I'm tired. Well, you're gonna have to put everything
you've got left into this last swing. You got this. Think of your family,
think of everybody. You got this, Chandler! Chandler, you gotta get one, bro. Last swing. Wait! It's so close! It was, like, two feet! That's what you get
paid to do, right? I get paid to be funny,
you get paid to hit home runs. Judge, what charity would you like us
to donate this money to? Oh, this will go to
the All Rise Foundation. Chandler, don't look at this. Yeah, honestly you should just
look away. I mean, I'm glad it's going
to the kids, man. That's why I didn't
hit any of ‘em. You’re a good guy. Alright. On to the next 1V1. But for this 1V1, we're gonna do something
a little bit different. We're gonna see if
these 5 contestants can hold their breath
longer collectively… than this gentleman. That's it? The World Record Breath-Holder. Are you scared at all
of the 5 of them? No, I'm not. Those guys, with all due respect,
they uh… I'm cannonballing, first time. I'm gonna try to get as
much water out as possible. I could try to drink it. Yeah. And you still hold
the world record? Yes. I started when I was 48. How old are you now? - 60.
- Dang! Don't lungs, like,
degrade with age? It's like 5 minutes. - Like, you guys got it.
- Easily. And if somehow you guys
do manage to beat him, I will give you… No! Bring it on in! A brand new Lamborghini. We gotta win this! In the next 20 minutes,
this could be your guys's Lamborghini. Wait, 20 minutes? No, you said 5 minutes was
his best time. It's like five minutes.
You guys got it. This could be your Lamborghini
very soon. We will die for
this Lamborghini. Contestants! Will both of you
get inside the tank? I don't know how to swim, though. Oh, if you don’t know
how to swim, you won. Yo, look at him.
Look what he's doing. Do that. He's doing breathing techniques. Are you ready? - Yes.
- Let’s run it. 3, 2, 1… Go! Let’s go! They are both under the water. Five average dudes versus
the greatest breath-holder on the planet. Hey! What? - Five what?
- We’re not average! Five slightly-above-average dudes. You guys might
win this Lambo. Oh, he's already panicking. What did I say?
Stay down there, bro! Dude, that was only 23 seconds! Ed, we're all dying for this. Wait, no. He came up!
Get out! Get in there! Wait, I gotta— Get in there! They are freaking out over there. Meanwhile, he’s just zen-ing out. What? Push him down! No way! It’s only been 45 seconds. Push him down! These guys quickly realized just how
difficult this challenge actually was. They’re already on the third person and
it’s only been a minute. That's it? Alright, 2 left over here. Before they knew it, they had put all the
pressure on their one remaining player. - What is this?
- That’s a Lamborghini. No, this is your Lamborghini. It's my Lamborghini. Now, get in there! You got this!
You got this! C’mon! C’mon, Raech. C’mon, Raech. Hey, calm down! Wait! Wait!
He’s panicking! Wait, is he gonna give up? Oh, no no no no no! Don't let him come up! Time’s up!
You guys lost! Don, you're good! You guys only lasted
3 minutes and 13 seconds. Can we make sure
he's alive? Don't worry.
He was still very much alive. And went on to hold his breath for
11 minutes and 45 seconds. I'm ok! Now that I know this guy is
somehow still breathing, I say we go to our final competition
before we finish with Neymar. To my right is Joey Chestnut. You'll know him as the winner of literally
every hot dog eating contest ever in history. And to my left
are 4 Sumo wrestlers. Combined, these behemoths
weigh over 1,500 pounds. Whichever side eats the most hot dogs in
10 minutes wins this $100,000. 3, 2, 1… Go. The glizzy contest has now begun. They've each ate half of 1,
which means they've technically ate 2. And Joey is already on his fourth. He's already eating at
twice the speed, gentlemen. He's going so fast I cannot
look away on this one. I don't know how he's doing that. These are all gonna go
in his stomach. It's been a minute,
and Joey’s already ate 10 hot dogs. And they're on 4, which means individually, they're eating
one tenth of the speed of Joey Chestnut. But the Sumo wrestlers
aren't giving up yet. This is his twentieth hot dog. He's on number 20.
And it's only been 2.5 minutes. Eleven over here by the
4 Sumo wrestlers. Guys, you're very, very close.
Just keep eating. You're beating them so badly. Do you wanna tell me what you think of
this Feastables chocolate bar? The greatest chocolate on the planet? Here you go. You can chew.
Oh! Ok! That’s good! Would you say it’s the world's
best chocolate? Oh, yeah!
Best in the world. Feastables is available
wherever you get your chocolate. For God's sake,
go try some! Anyways, forget about the chocolate!
Keep eating! I think I'm full at this point. You're full?
Is that what you said? Forty seconds remain!
It's a close race. Everyone, just shove
glizzies in your mouth! Put the glizzies in your mouth! Yes! Hurry! C’mon! Do you want it? Take the wieners out of your mouths.
The time is up. This harder more than Sumo! Chandler, how many glizzies
did Joey Chestnut eat? 46. If we go over here to
the 4 sumo wrestlers, how many did they eat? Thirty three hot dogs. Joey, You won! Yes! Can anyone beat this man? What charity do you want me to donate this
$100,000 to? Gleaners Food Bank in Indiana.
They make sure kids don't go hungry. Are you gonna eat
all the food? Nah, I'm gonna make sure the kids
are eating plenty of food. You're gonna make sure
the kids get the food. - Yeah.
- Ok. Now that I’ve given away almost
a million dollars, it's time to give away even more in
our epic grand finale with Neymar! And now, the moment you've
all been waiting for. One of the greatest football players
on the planet: Neymar! An international football superstar with
28 championship wins, one Olympic gold medal,
and above all, the crown as Brazil's all-time
leading goal scorer. He’s gonna be going up against our boy
Higor over here. And they're going to be competing for
half a million dollars. If you win, this money goes
straight into your bank account. But if Neymar wins, I will donate it to
whatever charity he chooses. - Makes sense?
- Yes, sir. Sorry, you lose! Oh, he just said,
""You lose!"" You're gonna take that? No, definitely not! Ok. Neymar,
does that scare you? Ok! As always, the rules of
this game are simple. We're gonna start things off with
a penalty shootout. If they both score,
we're gonna go 15 feet back. And we’re gonna keep going
15 feet back until one of them scores and
one of them misses. Who’s shooting first? - Alright. 1, 2…
- Rock, paper, scissors, shoot! - I won.
- Me first. Yeah, Neymar's first? Put the pressure on me.
That’s what you want, right? Easy. Easy! Ok. We all knew they were both gonna score,
but now let's head 15 feet back. Oh, he's getting serious. He's deemed you're a worthy opponent.
He tied his shoe. It doesn't take a football player as
coveted as Neymar to nail the first 4 stations of shots. So far, they're both
making it look easy. But the fifth station and beyond
separates the average from the elite. Eventually this is gonna become
hard for them. We will keep going the whole distance on
the pitch if we have to. - Now you go first.
- Me first? The GOAT said he wanted
you to go first. I will go first then. Ok! That was your
worst shot so far! Alright, Neymar's up! Oh my gosh! Well that literally curved
out of the goal and in! I love pressure! How does this compare to
playing in the World Cup? Nah! World Cup more pressure. Hey, wait, wait! Before you go,
you wanna hold the half a million? Sure thing. You can score this, he misses,
and then this is yours. You can beat Neymar, ok?
Believe in yourself. Alright. No! Neymar has to score.
If he misses, it's a reshoot. Miss it. Alright, let's give him
a little space. The goal only counts if
it hits the crossbar and goes in. Otherwise, it doesn’t count. Neymar is so good that he doesn't want me
to count the goal unless it touches the crossbar and
then goes in. Bro, don't miss. C’mon. Don’t miss!
C’mon, man! Ok! He is lucky Neymar
is a forgiving man. Neymar didn't even wait. That was the most nonchalant thing
I've ever seen in my life. Alright, for this one
I say Neymar goes first. Normally in Neymar shoes, there's a
giant world class goalie in goal. Now it's empty. Oh my gosh! There you are. I'm worried for you, buddy.
This could be it. Just aim at that camera over there
and then— Neymar is literally coaching him. See! That's it! Easy! See! He did it! Let's go! We are officially at midfield. We'll keep going as
long as this takes. Whenever you're ready. Oh my gosh! Oh, that’s not a goal! Is it? Wait, let's go look.
Come on! Wait, wait, wait.
Get a shot of that. Yeah, it's on the line. The majority of the ball's over the line.
How does that work? No, it has to be full! Oh, really? Neymar! Come check this out! Nah, no goal, no goal. Yeah, it's on the line! No goal. On the line! If the ball is still touching the line,
it is technically not a goal. And as you can see,
it's on the line. That means, if you score,
you win. If you score,
you won, bro! From midfield, you now have a
half a million dollar shot. Yes, sir. Ok! Higor, it's on you. Half a million dollars on the line. The biggest shot
of his life. The GOAT Neymar watching.
Is Igor clutch? He did it! Let's go! Wait, where did those whales come from?
I'm confused. Let’s go! Aw, that's so sweet! Here’s your half a million dollars! - Yes! Let's go! C'mon!
- Let's go! Alright! Let's go whale! Ok. Oh, he’s eating him! I don't know what's going on.

-4GmbBoYQjE,"We just got dropped off on
this 2,000-year-old ancient temple! - Bro, we're so high up!
- And we're surrounded by jungle. See ya later! Let's go see what we can find! In this video, we're gonna be exploring
dozens of ancient temples, all of which hide ancient Mayan secrets
from the world, deep underground. Everything you guys are seeing now
the Mayans didn't want us to see. Nobody gets to go where we're going. Including exploring one of the
seven wonders of the world. But we only had 100 hours
to make discoveries. Dude, I'm discovering
these stairs are huge. Yeah. I wanna find an escalator. Let's go discover
the secrets of the Mayans. This is the door to the inside of
this massive Mayan temple. Oh, that's a deep tunnel. Dibs on going first! That's fine with me.
There’s booby traps. - This temple is over 2,000 years old.
- Woah. This is insane! We're inside an ancient temple right now. Where are we going?
Oh, my gosh! Oh, wow. The first thing you see in this temple
is this giant statue, which is supposedly the corn god
inside of a jaguar’s mouth. This is so beautiful! My gosh! I'm gonna tell you what I think this means
then you tell me what it means, okay? This is a hand. This is a parade.
That's a toilet. - Errr! Wrong!
- Okay. No, that is not his toilet.
That is his earring. - Yeah, Jimmy.
- Oh. So here's the thing,
this place is actually a pyramid built on top of a pyramid. So, the deeper we go in,
the older things get. - Be careful, boys.
- This is so sketchy, Jimmy. Can't believe the government's
letting us do this! It really is crazy. Not even archaeologists
are allowed to go back here. How deep underground are we? And after hours of navigating
this ancient temple, we finally made it to the end. Now that we're at the end,
you said you had a surprise. Yes! This has been found in
the last two decades. Whoa! What?! It is a funerary mask. This is the face of one of
the kings of the Snake Kingdom. The Mayans used masks like this one
to shield those that had passed away from dangers on
their journey to the underworld. - Can I hold it?
- Yes. - This was made over 1,000 years ago.
- Yes. Which means my great-great-great-great-
great grandparents weren't even alive. Why is this not in a museum?
Why's a YouTuber holding this? Get this away from me!
Take it. Take it. Don't tell anybody. Okay. I totally won't show
200,000,000 people. That's it for this temple,
but we are in the middle of a giant city with multiple other ancient temples! And later in this video, even visiting
the seventh wonder of the world! Let’s find some treasure! This jungle’s full of monkeys, snakes,
and people have even died to jaguars here. Well, we survived Snake Island. Wait… Is that a monkey? Sir! Sir! Sir! Well, guys, this is where
we’re gonna be camping tonight. Look at these hammocks! We still have over
a dozen temples to explore. I need you guys to get some good sleep,
because this video's just getting started. Good morning, boys! Good morning! First things first, we need to explore
the rest of this massive abandoned city. And looking at it now, it's hard to
imagine what it might've looked like. And, so, I'll just show you. Over 100,000 people
used to live in this city. That's what that used to look like. This is what they think these roads
looked like. There were temples everywhere.
It was flourishing. But on the inside, you’d witness
magnificent artwork like this. - Whoa!
- Oh, this is incredible. One of my favorite part of these videos
is when we take old paintings and bring 'em to life. So this is our best estimation of
what they represent. Bro this is so cool! It’s a rare glimpse into what the life of
a Mayan looked like 2,500 years ago. This is amazing! Nolan really thought that was a llama. - Can we talk about this for a second?
- Nolan, you thought that was a llama? Cuz, look, if— I thought that was the eye,
that was the mouth, and I thought that was the leg. Yeah, I thought you… were smart. And after I picked on Nolan, Nolan returned the favor to
Tareq with a spider. - Tareq, only—
- Stop.  Tareq's gonna quit. My friends have a strange way of
having fun, but the Mayan way was arguably stranger. We're standing where a ball court used
to exist over 2,000 years ago. This was the first ever team sport
to use a ball. As far as we know… Also the captain of the losing team's
head got cut off. Yes. No, but the Mayans are crazy, man. - Whoa!
- This is huge. Yeah. So beautiful. Why don't we build temples
like this today? Around 2,000 years ago, this is where
the king and his queen lived. But 2,500 years ago,
this is what it looked like. Massive crowds of people would gather here and even wait for hours just for
a chance to see the king. And here it is today. - Let's go check it out.
- Okay. 2,000 years ago,
the king would probably stand here and watch sports from his palace. Kinda cool. Oh, my gosh.
It's kinda like a labyrinth. Yes, because if you want to
protect your king… - You make it confusing.
- …you make it confusing Ernesto, be honest with me. Has anyone ever pressed this block in to
see if it reveals hidden treasure? I would not do it… How about this one? How about this one? You’re telling me the king didn't build
a hidden treasure room 2,600 years ago? Maybe yes, but it's hidden. With the hopes of finding
the king's treasure, we ventured to a cave deep in the jungle, where the treasure may lie. Hey, Jimmy did not say anything
about bats, bro. Oh my…
Yo, there's so many bats. They just flew right behind our heads. The Mayans, they used to think that this
is the mouth of the monster of the Earth. Look above us right now. We're surrounded by bats. Thousands of bats swarming us. Dude, it’s a bat tornado. If there is a Mayan treasure there,
it's under tons of… - Bat poop.
- …bat poop. I feel like I've already
found my treasure. This is beautiful.
We're gonna leave. There's a lot of bats.
I would prefer if you go fast. Oh, I got poo’d on! For me, this is the real treasure. - Oh, it hit my hand!
- Nolan, let's get you out of here. We’ve gotta get out of here.
There's absolutely no treasure here. But there's still one more temple
that might have treasure. And because it's already dark out— Boys, light your torches,
and let's go on an adventure. If our torches go out before we get to
an ancient temple, I'm gonna be very sad. Temple! Temple!
Temple! This is so much cooler with just torches.
Let's see what this bad boy looks like. Feel like an ancient adventurer. - But as it turns out…
- All right, it's a dead end. …this didn't go well either. Everything's a dead end. - Oh, my God!
- What was that? There's, like, a monkey up there. Wait, is that a monkey or a jaguar?! Why is this video becoming
scary all of a sudden? Make sure you sleep well tonight, because I have a big surprise
for you in the morning. Let me guess, you guys thought
the dozens of ancient temples in this city was the entire video? - Yeah.
- Yeah, I think so. Send the helicopter back. Because to explore even further,
we were gonna need a lift. I'm climbing these stairs like a dog… We're almost there. There's our ride! All right, we’ve gotta go. Let's go explore some more temples! And where we're going has some of
the craziest ancient remains ever built by mankind. And to kick off this location,
we're gonna visit this bad boy, which the Mayans used to call
the gateway to the underworld. Back in the day,
there used to be giant fangs here. What happened to them? They fell off. That seems logical.
Let's go explore! Whoa… this is awesome. There's some very special features that
I love, like that structure in the middle. Wow. I'm gonna guess this
building was a temple. Was it for sacrifices? - Yes. You got it.
- Yes! I had something right! - What a nerd.
- Bro lost his hat. But what our guide
really wanted to show us was a cave which Mayans believed
humans emerged from. The Maya believe that humanity
came from a cave. Deep inside of there is what they called
the Tree of Life, and they believed that all of us spawned
from this very majestic, beautiful tree deep in this cave. This is so sacred that we're gonna
do a ceremony to ask for permission to
the spirits of the cave. If I was a betting man, I'd say
the spirits are gonna reject Nolan. And as we entered the cave… Whoa. Okay. This definitely looks sacred. …we were met with the ritual
our guide spoke of. What is he doing now? He's purifying the entrance of the cave. And it's here where we would seek
the approval of the gods. Naturally, I wasn't worried at all. But were the gods really about to let
Nolan enter this sacred place? I hope they accept me. I think it's good. What's he doing? All right, is he good? - Come on. The spirits didn't reject him.
- Thank goodness. So with the gods
officially on our side, we started our journey for
the Tree of Life. But the deeper into the cave we went,
the hotter it got. Is it just me, or is it only getting
hotter in this cave? It’s getting hotter, and the air's
gonna be more difficult to breathe. More difficult to breathe, yeah. I’m so hot right now. The deeper you go in the cave,
the thinner the air gets. I don't know if you can see the sweat.
It is really hot in here. This cave just keeps on going,
but at least there’s no bats. Everything you guys are seeing now,
the Mayans didn't want us to see. They literally tried sealing this off. Imagine being a Maya 2,000 years ago,
see this beautiful cave, and all of a sudden see
this beautiful room… Whoa. …and the amazing tree. Oh… Am I the only one that thought
the Tree of Life was an actual tree? Yes, this is it. This is the sacred Ceiba
that holds the sky. Are these pots around it the same pots
the Mayans created? Yes, sir. So the tall ones,
they put incense, and they burn it to
get the attention of the gods. This is very cool. If you were a Mayan
thousands of years ago, and actually believed that
this is where humans came from, I understand why they thought
this was so sacred. Of course, of course. But this cave is about to
get really dangerous, because where we're going next, we will
literally need an oxygen tank to breathe. Why do I keep doing things in videos
that could kill me? Worst idea ever! So after a few deep breaths
to top off on oxygen… - How deep are we going?
- About two football fields. Yo, I'm gonna stay up here. - You're always backing out on it.
- He said there's no oxygen. I don't wanna hear it. And Nolan may have
been on to something, because at the literal first thing
our guide wanted to show us… I'm dizzy, and, uh… - Are you good? Hey, take—
- No, I'm good, I'm good. Whether you like it or not,
you're gonna get some oxygen. Breathe. Anyways, what were you saying? Well, there's some, uh,
ceramic pot shards. Whoa… This is so cool. Can I take one home? Well, you would go to jail. - I would go to jail?
- Yeah, sure. All right.
I won't take one home. I can't believe they actually
believe me. They're so gull—
they're so gullible. Time to blend in
and scare 'em. Look at all the bats in this tunnel. Let's continue! Wait, I actually— Unironically, I don't know.
Do bats bite humans? I found a hiding spot. Oh, there's a bat. Jimmy, get you a hit of this oxygen. So we're only getting deeper. Here, get you some. The air’s getting thicker. But as we got close to the end, we were confronted by
the final boss of this secret tunnel. - See those, uh…
- Okay. …the stalactites? Wait! Jimmy, behind you is
the biggest spider in the world. Oh, my gosh! What did the Mayans give
the insects down here? Why do you think
the world's largest spider is at the end of a secret tunnel
in the most sacred place of the Mayans? - It's protecting something.
- What do you think? I think so. So instead of fighting the final boss… …we let the secret tunnel
keep its secrets. Oh, my gosh. That was terrifying. I almost threw the oxygen tank
right at your face. And after escaping with our lives,
we were exhausted. So we headed to our new camp to turn in. Because not only were we gonna
need our energy for the seventh wonder of the world. For day four, I wanted to know what
the Mayans did for fun. Starting with… The first ever team-based game to
use a ball. Over 3,000 years ago,
the Mayans invented the game of pitz, where you score by shooting a ball
through a small hoop, like in basketball. Only, you can't use your hands
just like in soccer. But remember what we said
all the way back in day two… The losing captain’s head
would get cut off. The head? - This is hard.
- I say we're gonna get the hang of it. And although we started to
get a handle on the ball, it's safe to say
we were still far from scoring… So I even brought in
our camera guys to help out. But even then, failure after failure
only brought us countless more failures. Wait, wait. We might not ever score. But in ancient times, giving up meant
literally losing your head. Nolan?
You better stand up, bro. And so failure after failure
continued until… After a long day of this brutal sport,
the surviving players might've celebrated by heading down a sinkhole for
a relaxing dip in the natural pools. And while I'm not cutting any heads off,
Nolan did lose at pitz. - Is the water cold?
- You know, it’s kinda refreshing! - Oh, is it?
- Yeah. Go for it! Oh, this water feels amazing. It doesn't look like
you think it feels amazing. Oh, it's so cold! And although a swim in
the Cenote is refreshing, the craziest Mayan temple —
a literal seventh wonder of the world — is still to come. But first… A classic Mayan dinner! So everything you're seeing here is what the Mayans used to eat
over 1,000 years ago. As you've heard throughout this video,
they worshiped the corn god. And if you don't know,
corn is a main ingredient in tortillas. Whoever's editing this, did the Mayans
invent tacos? Yes or no? To our final night, cheers. Enjoy the Mayan tacos. And to wrap up the night,
we have a special Mayan dessert. The brand new
Feastables Peanut Butter Cups! Wait— brand new
but it's a Mayan dessert? Don't ask questions.
It's dessert. Here you go. The king of marketing over here. Bro, look at how much
peanut butter is in there. Isn't it sad that there are
humans on this Earth whose taste buds
have not been blessed with the brand new
Feastables Peanut Butter Cups? So if you want an ethically-sourced,
amazing-tasting snack… - …make sure you reach for Feastables.
- It's good. The only Mayan-approved snack
on the planet. Before I go to sleep, I wanna let you guys
know that I'm giving away $500,000 to ten random people
that subscribe to the channel. No joke. My birthday is coming up. And to celebrate, ten random people
that subscribe to the channel will win $50,000 each. Thanks to Jack Link's,
the best beef jerky, for providing me
this awesome birthday present. And I'll see you guys at
the seventh wonder of the world. And with the last remaining hours of
our trip here, it's the moment you've
all been waiting for: the seventh wonder of the world, the temple of K’uk’ulkan. Bro, this is so cool. I can't believe we're actually here. K’uk’ulkan is the seventh wonder of
the world, partially for its grand size, but weirdly enough,
also for the way it sounds. The Mayans somehow constructed this in a
way where if you clap in front of it… …you hear what sounds like a laser
coming back at you. All right, anyways!
What we actually came here for… At the top of this pyramid is a temple
so sacred to the locals that no one is allowed up there. Which begs the question: What Mayan
secrets lay in that ancient room? Out of respect for the culture and all the
people who hold this very sacred, we are not gonna touch the temple. Instead, we're gonna fly this drone up to
see what's in that secret room. - You cool with this?
- Yeah, that's cool. Godspeed. Oh, my gosh, this looks so majestic.
I'm dying to know. All right, let's see what's in this room. Wait… Arthur, the room's empty. Well… 500 years ago,
the Spanish came here, and they take a lot of stuffs inside. But before everything was stolen, this is what historians think the seventh
wonder of the world looked like. Man, not gonna lie,
it's actually very beautiful. And while we didn't find any gold, I'm grateful that I can even visit
these ancient monuments and share it with you. Guys, I love you.  Mexico, it's been great.
See you later.",unknown

uyiG6uw-6pA,"I chained this massive rock
to a random guy! Hi! And when this chain runs out, it's going
to pull him to the bottom of the ocean. And this is only the first
of 7 death traps we have planned for him. Like balancing
hundreds of feet in the air, stealing from
a thousand-pound grizzly bear, driving through a literal minefield, and so much more. And if he can survive all of that,
I'll give him half a million dollars. God, here we go! But first things first,
he'll have to escape this trap which, like all of them,
is so dangerous, we had to have
trained safety professionals on set. And every second it takes him
to unlock his chain, he sinks deeper and deeper
into the ocean. Oh! He's up! He did it!! Yes! Congrats! Woo! You're now one step closer
to half a million dollars! Yeah! But escaping this next trap
won't be so easy. Welcome to the second death trap! - Open the cage!
- What? Take off your blindfold and turn around. Oh, my God! This real-life 1,000-pound grizzly bear
is now guarding your money. I think that 50 grand is his now. And like every trap in this video,
your money has been split up. However many bags of 50 grand
you can get to the exit moves on with you to the next trap. The challenge begins now. Good luck. All right, I'm just gonna get froggy. Oh, he's getting so close to the bear. You went for that one of all of ‘em? How are you staying so calm? I'm not. I look this way,
but the reality is, I'm not calm. The bear just looked at you walk by. Uh, be careful, bro… Even though Byron was absolutely terrified - of getting torn to shreds by this bear…
- Brother? The bear is literally standing
on one of the bags. He's gonna rip that open. The bear was fixated on one bag of money. He's preoccupied. Byron snuck around the room,
easily collecting the rest, until the bag the bear was eating
was the last one. The last fifty grand
is currently being eaten by the bear. Byron, you don't have to do this.
You can stop. Byron, if you're too afraid
to steal that last bag from the bear… you can quit now
and just move on to the next trap with the money you did get. No. I'm not quitting. Well, be careful.
Don't grab it yet. Just maybe wait
till he gets bored of it. He's trying to distract the bear
away from his money. Oh, it might— It's kinda working. He's trying to get a killing machine
to go over to him. He might be the first human ever to want
a thousand-pound bear to come towards him. Oh my God,
he's going for the last bag! - Oh! He did it!
- He got it! Oh my God! Oh my God! Congrats! And for our third of seven death traps,
you might recognize the challenge, but we put a new spin on it
just for Byron. Take off your blindfold!
Welcome to the next death trap. Oh, no, Jimmy… We're not even 100 feet in the air yet. Oh my God! Raise us up! Welcome to the Balance Beam of Death! God, c’mon… Actually, we'll call it
the $500,000 Balance Beam. Your 500 grand is dangling
100 feet in the air. You must balance on this narrow beam, unlock each bag of 50 grand,
and throw them on the target below. Any money that lands on the target,
you move on with, and any money that ends up in the water
is lost forever. Oh my God. You chicken now?
You gonna walk across? The only thing on this platform that's
chicken are your legs. This is for you, kids. Oh, he's off! The first step. My God, he's doing it.
He's actually doing it. Oh my gosh, look at his feet.
This is insane! Now he's gotta reach for the money. Oh, he got the money. This is scary 'cause, look,
he's actually leaning back. Bro, what's going through your mind?
You're like a scarecrow. - Jimmy you're talking too much right now.
- You're not talking enough! Oh, God. All right.
Are you gonna throw 'em from here? He landed one! Don’t celebrate too early, Byron.
You still have 9 bags to go. He's lining his shot up! Speaking of legs,
my leg is cramping right now. Come massage it right now for me! Oh, he threw it! He’s two for two. All right, can he keep his streak alive? Third bag is off. Bullseye! He has $200,000 on his target,
and Byron isn't even halfway across yet. You feel that wind, Byron? Oh, yeah. The wind
is really picking up. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
It's very unstable. It's actually shaking like crazy! Oh, he almost fell! God! Shoot! Don't pass out on me! Oh, he's just dropping ‘em.
He's just dropping ’em! Oh, no. It bounced off. He lost 50K. C’mon, baby! And if you're wondering who
this maniac is, his name is Byron, a battle-hardened Army Ranger who's fought
in the world's most dangerous war zones, and above all else, he wants
to bring this money home to his kids. Let's go! C’mon, baby. That's it,
that's it. That's already $100,000 in the water. And if he falls now,
he's losing another $100,000. You gotta land these next two! - Right on the money!
- Yeah. All right. The last bag! I'm in my head right now. Byron, do it for your kids! Byron, you lost a lot of money
on this round. You've already lost 150 grand,
and you're only on the third trap. - Jimmy!
- Yeah? I have a deal for you. You give me 100K back,
and I'll jump off this. 50 grand and you have a deal. 75! Sure! Just because I wanna see it. You're 100 feet in the air!
What are you talking about? Byron, you're crazy! I've been told that once or twice. Byron, you and your $425,000
are moving on to trap 4 out of 7. Take off your blindfold! Welcome to the Minefield of Death. Oh my God! Jimmy! Buried beneath this minefield
are 20 gargantuan bombs completely hidden out of sight. Come on, Jimmy! Your job is to drive your money
across the minefield, but be careful which path you take. Because if you
accidentally trigger a mine, all your money inside of that car
will burn to ashes. Roger that. But lucky for you,
you have 5 chances to save your money. You can put it all in one car.
You could spread ‘em amongst the 5 cars. It's all up to you. So, this is car number 1. - How much money do you want to put in it?
- None. Predictable. How about car number 2? 25K. You're putting 25 grand in? No, no, no! You can put it all in the last one
and just pray you don't hit a mine. 25K in this vehicle. - We'll go for it.
- Yes, let's go! And let’s put everything else
in the last car. Any sane person would not have chosen to spread their money
outside of the last car. But as I'm sure you've
already picked up on, Byron's not exactly what I'd call normal. So, one of the great benefits
to this challenge is that most of my experience
is with roadside bombings. I'm not sitting
in this vehicle this time. Wait, so you were in a car
that drove over a real mine? Yup. The terrorists buried
a roadside bombing too deep. And when it went off,
it just created a big bump in the road. I didn't know that!
Please tell me this doesn't give you PTSD! No, I mean… not really. Lovely. All right, anyways, to the Bunker! Ooh, buddy! And now, the remote control. Of death… It is rigged up to car number 1. Obviously, you hit a mine,
the car will blow up. Ok guys, here we go. He's moving! This first car has no money in it.
It's technically risk-free. But the more of the map you uncover
in this car, the better your odds are
of saving your money in the next car. You could take the right path.
You could take the left path. - I'm gonna go left.
- I'm terrified. There could be an explosion
at any point. Oh, no! It is not left. One car down, four more to go. But this time, $25,000 is on the line. All right, here we go. I got a hitchhiker! - Karl?
- What is he doing? Karl’s gonna make sure
your car burns extra good this time. I would really avoid
this next mine. Thanks, Karl! On this first path, he accidentally
picked the side that had the mine, which means the right side is clear. Do you regret putting
25 grand on this one? Yo, 100,000%. He now has another fork in the road. You gonna go left or right? Yeah, I'm gonna stick with the right. So far, so good. I could've just stayed in there. Two cars down and $25,000
of your money is up in flames. Do we have to talk about it? That amount of money could’ve bought you
a non-exploded car. Karl, he could kill you,
just so you know. No, I'm very aware.
I'm very aware. All right, Byron, you haven't even made it
halfway through yet. You only have two more failures before you send your remaining $400,000
down this road of explosives. At this pace,
you'll lose all the money. Oh my goodness. - Send out your third car!
- Here we go. You got this. You're the bomb. Just stand out there for the rest. Now you can focus better. So right now,
I am completely unable to see my vehicle. Oh, it's killing me that I don't know
where the mines are. - Any second now it could blow up.
- God, I don't wanna look. You're coming up on the next 50/50.
Big decision. You're going right? Yup. - My heart.
- Oh my God. I'm so nervous. Don't forget, the more mines you trigger
with your empty cars, the safer that $400,000 becomes
on your final drive. So far, so good… - What are you thinking?
- I'm gonna go left. What made you pick left? Uh, it's just a harder route. If it's hard,
I'm doing it. That's what she said also. - Karl, this is a serious moment.
- Sorry. This is intense. Over halfway. No bomb yet, but there could be several
between this car and the finish line. I'm gonna stay committed. Oh, he doesn't care. - You're just ripping!
- He doesn't care! So you now have a winning path. The question is, can you remember it? No, but we're gonna go. So, using his last empty car, Byron made
sure he had the route memorized. - You're good!
- Remember the route. Because for the final car, all $400,000
of his money was now on the line. Now that you know the path, I say
we do something special for the final car. I don't trust you anymore! This time, we're gonna walk
behind the car. Let's do it. Onward! So if you accidentally trigger a mine, now we'll get a front row view
to his money blowing up. - You sure this is the path you took?
- Yes. We're literally
in between two mines right now. That guy right there is our safety expert,
and he keeps telling us to back up. So Byron, can you back up? Why have a safety exp— - Karl!
- Jimmy! - Stay on the side.
- What're you doing? We're walking through a minefield!
I'm the wrong one? Keep driving! Wait, I don't know
if I remember the path. I actually don't remember
if this is right. Is it right or is it left? Wait, wait. Stop! Wait!
He's going so quick. You're one mine away
from ending this entire video. Uh, God! Stop! Stop! Congrats! Your money survived! Good job! It's on my neck! Yeah, ok here.
I got you. Don't— Don’t die. Don't die. - Wait, wait! The car, the car!
- Oh, the car! We'll stop it! Could you imagine
if that triggered a mine and blew up? - Oh, it's coming back!
- Wait. It doesn't have brakes! Jimmy said, ""It doesn't have brakes,""
and got behind it! Well, yeah.
I had to brake it. All right. Anyways, duck behind the car.
Duck behind the car. Why are we ducking? - All the mines you didn't blow up
- Oh, God. we're gonna blow up now. Let's go to the next death trap. We just walked there! Byron's a little harder to kill
than I thought. But seriously, he'll be terrified
when he sees the twist on this next trap. Byron, take your blindfold off! For this next trap,
you're gonna be buried alive. Oh my God. You're gonna lay in that coffin. Then I'm gonna seal it, cover you with a
ton of dirt, and reveal the challenge. Do you trust me? No. Whenever you're ready,
climb in the coffin. There's a hatchet there,
which you'll need. You won't be needing this ladder anymore. Watch out, Karl. Seal the coffin! I'm sorry, Byron. I can't believe I'm doing this, but I'm actually helping you
seal me in a coffin. Permission to bury you alive? You have my permission to bury me alive. Get to shoveling, boys! Oh my God! Oh Byron, I'm so sorry. No, you're not! While we're burying you,
check underneath your pillow. You'll have the greatest chocolate
in the world, Feastables. And the greatest meat snack
on the planet, Jack Link's. Yep, yep, I've got 'em. - You have big muscles, right?
- One might say. And big muscles require protein,
wouldn't you say? I would. Which is why the Duos I gave you
is pretty convenient, because it's protein-packed
and made with 100% real beef. Quite honestly, probably
in the most uncomfortable position I've ever been in my life. And at least I'm gonna have strong muscles
from my Duos. Oh, God! He's done. You are officially buried alive!
How does it feel? I've been better. As you can see,
there is a giant flaming furnace with a conveyor belt leading towards it. Pull the lever. Oh! There it goes. This is not your money.
This is test money. In a moment, this conveyor belt will start
slowly dropping your money into this fiery furnace. Behind your knee, you're gonna see an axe. You're gonna to use that axe
to break your coffin, somehow traverse through all this mulch, and turn that lever off. Which will then stop the conveyor belt,
AKA, stopping your money from burning. - Now, Karl, turn it off.
- Ok. Put his money
on the conveyor belt. I'll die before I quit. It's on you.
Give me a countdown! 3, 2, 1. Pull the lever! All right! Your money is officially
falling into the furnace! Good luck. Do you not feel bad burning his money? Of course I do. I feel like your actions
contradict your words. He needs to break
through the lid of his coffin. I need to get out of here!
Bro, it's getting everywhere. And while he's digging out of the hole, I wanna tell you about
Jack Link's new product, Duos, because it's actually
two separate flavors in the same bag. This bag, for example, has their
original flavor and their teriyaki. Boys, give it a try. I really enjoy the original and teriyaki. You wanna switch it up?
Go for the mango and jalepeno. Scan the QR code or click the link
in the description to buy now. Look at all his money
just coming up and it— Oh! Whoa. I just caught a dollar!
That was crazy! Some of you are gonna think that's fake,
but I don't even know how I'd fake that. Byron, your money's burning! This money is making his fire bigger. Keep going, Byron!
Get outta there! Over $10,000 of your money is burned! - Oh my gosh!
- C'mon! Oh, he's getting out! You got it! Oh, my gosh!
Don't cut yourself! Yes! - You're a monster!
- You came out like a zombie! He swallowed dirt! Before we go
to the next death trap, you let me know what you think of
Jack Link's Duo, their brand new product? These are legit phenomenal. Byron, I hope that jerky
gave you a lot of protein, because you're gonna need it
for this sixth trap. Welcome to the next trap. I'm a little bit nervous on this one. Behind you is your $384,000. Don't move. To the trap! Oh my God. What do you think the trap is? I'm going up somewhere. In order to pass this trap, you must scale up this 60 foot tower
while hanging this money behind you. And this trap is different than the last. It is all or nothing here. If you fall one time or drop a single bag,
just like in other videos like this, you will lose everything
and the video will end. But there is a twist. You don't have to carry all of it. To make yourself lighter,
you can leave some of the money behind. And all of this money
literally weighs 200 pounds. So it's up to you to decide
how much money to carry to the top. So one of the things
I'm thinking about right now is leaving it as high up
on this as possible. So if he leaves them
on that platform, that's basically 3 or 4 feet less that
he's gonna have to be pulling the bags. If he somehow cheats this trap,
I'm never casting an Army Ranger again. If you ain't cheating, you ain't trying. I can tell. I'm gonna be honest,
I don't think you can carry it to the top. Let's push this body
and see what it can do. You're crazy, man. I’m gonna go up top.
No shot he’s making it. A lot of people in my life didn't, uh, believe that I could do and accomplish
the things that I've accomplished, so my goal is to prove that I can. It's about that time
where you have to decide: How much money
are you going to attempt to drag up here? It's all or nothing,
brother. You are a psychopath. If just one extra bag is too heavy
for you, you'll risk losing all of it. You don't even want to just leave
50,000 behind? Nope. I'm going. All right, he's officially off. If he falls, the video ends.
He gets no money whatsoever. And as soon as all these bags
are suspended in the air, the full weight will be on his back. That's way heavier
than I was thinking. Look at this trail of bags behind him! He is literally climbing up a 90 degree
incline carrying 200 pounds of money! What's going through your mind? Ah, you brought the heat
on this one, Jimmy! He's going fast. Oh my God, he's falling. He is just brute-forcing it! Oh, God. All right,
the hardest part is coming up! Oh my God, almost there. Yeah, he has 200 pounds of money! I can't give up! Oh, gosh!
Let me get out of his way! Bro! This is insanely impressive. You have no idea
how heavy this is! Oh, you did it! You did it! Yeah! People don't realize how heavy money is. And when you have over 300,000 bills,
it adds up. You only have one death trap left between
you and me wiring you all this money. Oh, God. Jimmy. Let's do this. All right! To the junkyard! …where lies Byron's final obstacle
between him and his money. Are you ready? As ready as I'll ever be.
Let's do this. Why are you flexing? When I'm uncomfortable,
I just start randomly flexing. Ok! Take off your blindfold.
Welcome to the final trap. - You must protect your money right here
- Ok? from that bomb. Oh my God. I'm giving you three construction workers, Holy crap. - a ton of machinery,
- Ok. and you can use anything
in this junkyard to protect it. In 8 hours,
that bomb will drop. - Gotta go.
- Good luck! In past videos,
even when given 24 hours, contestants have failed
to protect their money. If Byron succeeds in a third of the time,
it will be a first in Beast history. So now we got to figure out
what's flammable, what's not flammable. This roof is plastic,
so that's gonna burn. We don't want that. You have a ton of hoods over here. - Do you think these will burn?
- No. So this could be, like,
your blast shield at the top. Yeah. All right, guys. I want to get as many of these hoods
over here as possible. If it burns, like, there's,
like, that felt on it? Rip— just rip that felt off. No fiberglass, no nothing.
It has to be metal and metal only. - Do you think this would be of any use?
- Not at all. But you can get rid of the plastic jugs
and use the metal. Uh, yep. Ok. So what you're seeing me do right now
is grabbing my cages that are going to end up
becoming my buffer. Now the flammable plastic is gone, he has this nice metal frame
to put around the money. That's smart. - Do you think these would be of any use?
- Not at all. Considering what the bomb
is potentially made out of and there's a liquid accelerant inside,
it's gonna burn fast, and this astroturf right here
is flammable. But it looks good on camera, though. I don't care. Ok. I figured he'd say that. They've gotta make sure they remove
everything flammable, because the bomb might increase
the temperature in there so much that it could light on fire. So now, we're gonna take this,
and we're gonna— Oh, you’re gonna make, like,
a shield with hoods. Yep, so bring in our containers. Then we're gonna start stacking them
as high as I can get them - Ok.
- creating a multi-story tomb of metal until, basically,
I'm told I can't build this any higher. You can build as high as you want. Ok, well, it's gonna keep going. Ok. Good luck! And as confident as he felt
about his plan, Byron thought there was still a piece
missing from his puzzle. We’re gonna create another layer of these
over the top of it, but I wanna get that money
as secured as possible. And I know I said the less I have
on there that's flammable, the better, but if it's insulated,
it may not affect the money at all. In Indiana Jones,
this literally survived a nuke. Yeah well, they don't make things
that way anymore. - So…
- Oh, really? You don't think this would survive? I mean… you know, it could. Well, I guess Byron gave
my Indiana Jones joke some thought, because it looks like
he just found the Holy Grail in money-incinerating defense. Oh, what is this?
What did we just find? Let's flip this. 1, 2, 3, flip! Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yes! So much “yes” right here. We're gonna close the money
inside of this, then bury it
at the bottom of my barricade. Now that Byron had everything he needed,
it was full steam ahead. Got it? So, yeah, we’re gonna start
laying those across, over the top. And I need cinder blocks stacked
in this dead space. All right here. The mentality that I have with things
is success or death, in everything. I don't give myself a plan B. You cannot have bravery
and courage… without fear. I'm not gonna, lie Byron's defense
strategy was looking pretty airtight. That was, until he decided to place a massive fiberglass boat
on top of his structure. That's a highly flammable object right next to the massive bomb
we're about to drop. Isn't the boat fiberglass? Oh, man… No fiberglass, no nothing.
It has to be metal and metal only. I'm genuinely at a loss right now. Time is up! - You all right?
- Yeah, yeah. Dead serious, like, just I'm seriously
just second-guessing everything right now. How you doing, buddy? Oh my gosh, Jimmy. Dude, you've literally buried me alive. You made me climb with over 200 pounds— Don't forget when we
drove through a minefield. Made me drive through a minefield. And I put you
in a room with a bear. A thousand pound bear.
Not just any bear. A huge bear. Absolutely everything comes down to this
last moment right here in front of me. Literally everything. The only thing that really matters
is always being a hero to my wife and kids but the influential mind,
seeing that fear is ok, it's what you do
in the midst of that fear. You can't have courage without… without being scared. $384,000 on the line
with your wife and kids here to watch, and it all comes down
to this explosion. Oh, man. - Are you nervous?
- Yes. I'm extremely nervous. Ok. Any last words? Let's do it. 3, 2, 1! Drop the bomb! Everything's on fire! Let's go! There’s so much fire! Byron, a bomb just went off!
Be careful. No! Oh, whoa.
That is burning. Go, Byron, go! It’s under the boat,
it’s under the boat, it’s under the boat! Oh, there’s still more! That is the fridge
he put his money inside of. All right, slowly bring her down! Moment of truth. It worked! Yes! - Yes!
- The money didn’t burn!! The money’s safe! Let's go! Yes! Yes! Oh my God! Congratulations! $384,000! 384 grand! We did it! This is gonna change
so much for us, Jimmy. I’m gonna buy a tractor

figrl0aOULs,"Every single time someone watches
this video, it helps feed someone in need. And since we get a lot of views, I brought a lot of people! Here you go. Thank you, friend. Yeah, no problem. If you're wondering how this works, every time someone
watches this whole video, including you right
now, money is generated. And as this video grows, that
increasing amount of money will feed an astonishing amount of people. Everybody eats. But that's not all it's going to do. Mr. Beast! You watching this video
will supply farmland, build massive kitchens, fill
schools with food for their students, and save children from child labor. So, honestly, I'm glad you're here. There you go. 1500
people have now been fed. I'm very excited for the future. And because of our meal program, the school attendance skyrocketed, so it only made sense to
upgrade their classrooms. They have so few desks at the school that some students
literally have to sit on rocks. I assume you're not supposed
to put four kids on one of these. Of course. This is only
supposed to take two kids. - Really?
- Not four. Can you ask them if they'd like new desks? [speaking foreign language] Yes! I'll be right back, then. Bring it on in! We got some new desks for everybody! And now, even with all these new
students, everyone has a place to sit. Look how happy they are! Let’s get to unloadin'! Bro, I love this video! This really puts into perspective... the things we take for
granted in America and Europe. Like, something as simple
as a new desk for their school so they don't have to sit on rocks... is literally making their week. - Thank you, Jimmy.
- No problem. This means a lot to me. All right, thanks for the help, guys.
They're carryin' all the way right now. You ready for your new desks? Yeah! Yeah? Obviously, they can't feed all
these kids breakfast and lunch every school day with... this “kitchen"". Which is why we built
this brand new kitchen! And on top of revampin' the school, we also dug a well
here with water storage, plus a greenhouse and,
pan the camera, a farm. We are hooking this school
up with everything they need. And for the influx of students
at neighboring schools, we're partnering with... Massive farms like this one! And this is Justice.
He runs the farm. Welcome to Oleleshiva farm. We have two parts of the farm. One part of the farm
goes directly to the schools, and the other part of the farm, we specifically grow to
sell to nearby communities, which helps to keep the nonprofit going. And because right now these
farms are using manual labor, which is not efficient enough to produce
as much food as the schools need... ...we brought you a brand new tractor! No way! Now, instead of people
doing manual work like this, they can instead just use this tractor. What previously took 45 minutes
will now just take 45 seconds. This tractor is more
important than you may realize. Just because we're takin' the
money from all the views on this video and giving it to school meal programs, doesn't mean food just
magically spawns outta thin air. The food has to come from somewhere, and in this case, it's comin' from
the increased yield on this tractor across this massive farm. And to be sure this food reaches
as many people as possible, we've got a special
surprise for the school. Everyone, come over here! Here are the keys to your brand
new truck for the community! Congratulations! What?! I want you to use this to
feed all of the community. Thank you. Thank you so
much! We have a new truck!! This truck will enable the
school to provide excess meals to families all over the community. And inside of your guys's brand new truck
is enough food for over 100,000 meals! The community was so
thankful they...gifted me a goat. I have a goat now. And if you thought
100,000 meals was a lot, by the end of this video,
because of your view, we will be giving away a million meals. That's Kenya for ya! Let's head to Ghana, where we also funded the construction of
not just another kitchen and water tank, but also a new farm for a local school. The cabbage we're planting here, in around
two and a half months, will look like this. We can feed the students just
from this small cabbage farm. But unlike this farm, the
millions of others all across Ghana don't share such a positive story. It’s a farming community. Most
of the parents are cocoa farmers. And sadly, the children are as well, playing a crucial role in
generating their family's income. Four out of five of your students, before they enrolled to this
school, worked on a cacao farm. Yeah. And now, instead of
working on a cocoa farm, they're getting an education just
because we're giving them a free meal. Yeah. This food is increasing our enrollment. It will bring the kids to school
and they'll stay in school, too. And... we found another
way to help kids stay in school. These are their brand-new cows. We bought dozens of pairs of animals that
we're gonna be gifting to these families, and with that extra income, they'll be able to send
their kids to school as opposed to having them work on farms. Tomorrow will be
their first day of school? Yes. Congrats! All right! And with so many animals to give away, I had to rely on Tareq for
help, which... was a mistake. Tareq, bring out the next
ten goats at the same time! Oh, man, that's a lotta goats. That's a lotta goats. Come
on, goats! Come on, come on! Here we go. Wait! No, no no! Somebody get the goats! All right, Tareq! Tareq! They got away. Tareq, you're fired. Congrats on your brand-new goats!! And I know the perfect way
to celebrate our time in Ghana. Have you guys had chocolate?
Tell me what you guys think of it! No problem. Do you like the taste of it? Yes! Do you guys wanna see the drone? Yes. If you look up, you can
see yourself on the camera! You are welcome, you are welcome,
you are welcome, my friend. It's sad, but 45 percent of children that live in to cacao
farming households in Ghana work in illegal child labor. So to fight this, at Feastables, we're working with the farmers
to establish Child labor monitoring and remediation systems to get these kids out of
child labor and into school. It's been our prayer that we have
school feeding for our learners, and now we have it. So, we thank you so much, and we
hope that this will continue for years. I hope forever. And now that these families
in Ghana have enough to eat, back in the United States, ending hunger requires solving
a completely different problem. Believe it or not, America
produces so much food, that almost 40 percent of
it simply gets thrown away. But if we can preserve
just ten percent of it, we could theoretically end
hunger in the United States. And that brings us to the Philadelphia
Wholesale Produce market... One of the largest food
marketplaces in America! Where every year, up to ten million pounds of unsold
food is at risk of going to waste. Which is where Evan and his
nonprofit, Sharing Excess, come in. And if they don't have a place to sell it,
it's the easiest option to throw it away. Let's take these potatoes, for example. Some retailer might be like, ""Hey, if they're within one month
of expiring, we don't want it."" But instead you're like, ""Yo! why
not give it to people who are starving?"" That's right. It's a no-brainer. So Evan and his
organization, Sharing Excess, collect millions of pounds of food that, for silly reasons, would
have been thrown away. What are we lookin' for? This looks good. That looks good, so we're
gonna put it in the good box. This one? This one looks a little... not good. Not so good. Throw it in the bin. Okay. And that's all you do? Yeah. If we make it more
complicated, people wouldn't do it. Wait, Tareq, why is your pepper so small? I think I got the biggest
pepper out of the boys! Everyone knows
this is what you do with your pepper. Wait. Your pepper's deformed, Nolan. It's, like, curly. Yo, the boys wish they
had a pepper this big. All this food is just what's been
donated today from this building. And there's even more out there. We need more trucks to be able to pick up all of the food that's actually available. This market and others like it, have so much food that even Sharing Excess Organization can't distribute it all
before it goes bad. But with just one more truck, they could rescue up to seven million
pounds of additional food, every year. And maybe you can see where this is going, but I made sure Evan couldn't as I led him to the surprise
that I had prepared for him. Evan, take off your
blindfold and turn around! Look at your brand new truck!!! Yeah! And again, just by watching this video, you're helping us give more
money to Sharing Excess so that they can continue to fill this
new truck with food for years to come. But let me show you what just one
day with an additional truck can do... starting with supplying the
Double Trellis Food kitchen where they cook gourmet
meals for the needy every day. Everything you see here
would have been thrown away, but now it is a gourmet meal going
to someone in need. This is crazy. And while the meals we
cooked fed 600 people, our one truck still had thousands
of pounds of fresh produce to stock multiple community fridges, hand out directly to
people on the streets, and even host our own
food drive in North Carolina, where hundreds of people
were in need of nutritious food. And you can help too,
with the help of DoorDash. By watching this video right now,
you're helping feed someone in need. And for a limited time, if
you purchase this hoodie, available exclusively at
DashMarts on DoorDash, you're gonna help to donate... a hundred meals like
this to people in need. I got some meals for ya. - Oh, I appreciate it.
- Of course. I'm noticing Evan's putting his
Sharing Excess branding over the... DoorDash hoodies. All right, here we go. Oh, there he is! Sorry, I had to pause the
food drive to settle that. Do you need a hat? Scan the QR code or click
the link in the description to purchase your hoodie on DoorDash now. Let's help as many
people in need as possible. DoorDash's Project DASH, in just a few years has helped to deliver over
a hundred million meals. All this food would have been
thrown away. Isn't that crazy? That is crazy. Hey! Do you watch the videos? - Yeah.
- Do you know his name? No. She took a picture of me! Hey, neither do we! And once the food drive was over, I
still had two more surprises for Evan. Evan, I have two checks for you. First, to get us to a million meals, here's a check for six
hundred thousand meals. Oh, my God... Before the video goes up, we
said we'd do a million meals. I need you to do six
hundred thousand of them. We're on it. And then after the video goes up... I don't know yet. It depends how many of them
watch the video. So here's a blank check. And as they watch the video, I will fill it in so you can
keep feeding people in need. Oh, my God. Guys, please watch this video. We could provide so much food! The dollar amount written
here is up to you guys. And not only did DoorDash
step up to help fund these meals, but so did a gentleman named Tony
Robbins who has a message for you guys. What you're doing is so important. Every view you watch is
gonna bring more meals, so I'm gonna commit
ten million meals to you, matching funds for anybody
who wants to join me here. Let's really do everything we can and
get as many people helped as possible. Make sure you share
this video with your friends. Because of Tony Robbins and DoorDash, every 20 views equals a meal to
someone in need. Let's share this.",unknown
Uxc84UUrVHk,"There are over 1.5 million kids in child labor, so you can eat cheap chocolate. You see, big chocolate pays their farmers so little that they make less than a dollar a day on average. And as a result, 45% of children in Coco communities work in illegal child labor. And I want to tell you three things that Beastables is doing to get these kids out of childhood. First, we pay 100% of our cacao farmers a living income reference prize. It's a benchmark set by Fair Trade to ensure farmers earn enough where they can afford housing, food, and other basic necessities. Second, 100% of our cacao is fair trade certified, which is the gold standard for ethical certification. They have rigorous standards that protects the livelihoods of small farmers and farm workers. And third, the farms feast schools work with are actively implementing child labor monitoring and remediation systems so the kids can get off the farms and into school. So the next time you're in an American chocolate aisle, you have a decision to make. Support the status quo or you can eat feastables and say enough is enough. You care how your chocolate is sourced.

aKq8bkY5eTU,"I am currently on an
island infested with snakes! ...but I'm visiting way deadlier places. Like scaling a mountain covered in ice... I'm gonna die! Let me down! Driving a road that has
killed thousands of people... We’re like seven inches
from falling to our deaths. Swimming uncaged with vicious sharks... And so much more. All starting in this cage in the middle of an African
safari where there are lions, cheetahs, hippos and a dozen
other species that could kill us. Why are we doin' this? Because we're visiting the
five deadliest places on Earth. Oh, I see one of them. Oh, my God, why are we doing this? And to make sure the lions actually
visit us, I brought a bunch of meat. To spread And surround the cage with it. Oh, man, are we trying to die? But what actually makes
this place so deadly, is that when the sun goes down and
we lose our sight, the animals do not. Jimmy, there's two lions. That sound. Is that a rhino? No! Bro, it’s huge. Dude, everything's coming out at night. Bro, we're surrounded by lions. They're literally twenty
feet away from us. Oh, my God... These lions will not stop circling us. We might actually die in this video. Well, let's see if we do! Because the next places
we'll be visiting in this video will progressively grow more
and more deadly than the last. All leading up to an island
riddled with poisonous snakes. And next, we're going to be ice climbing
on this massive, deadly, frozen waterfall. And now there is no turning back. One way or another, we are going to climb this massive
cliff using these bladed boots and these ice picks. This might be the scariest
thing we ever do. Wish me luck. Jimmy, you really expect
us to climb this whole thing? Yeah. There's no chance. Truthfully, I wasn't sure
if we could pull this off, but what happened next with Nolan
did not make me feel any better. No. All right, guys.
Guys, stop! I'm out. I'm out. You can't quit! Watch me. I can't believe Nolan
chickened out. That is insane. Nolan truly left us. We're
really high up right now. You're almost halfway! Oh, Jimmy, don't look down! Oh, my God. It's gettin' steeper as we go. Oh, my foot! I’m losing grip. Oh, did you almost fall? Yes! Oh, God. I see the top, Jimmy! This is the scariest
thing I've ever done. I'm doing this. I'm gonna get to the
top. Show ‘em how steep it's gotten. We’re in too deep, I can't quit! I got like ten percent left. I'm fighting the urge to cry, man. Even though I definitely
shouldn't have been doing this... You're almost there, Jimmy! I somehow made it all the
way to the top of this waterfall. We made it to the top. Let's go!! You know what? Nolan had the right idea. But we'll see if he can handle
the third place on our list. All the way in Bolivia, where we'll be driving a road
where few make it off alive. And now we are on the
deadliest road on Earth. This rock drop is literally
as tall as a skyscraper. I am regretting this. I really am. No joke, so many people died on this road that they literally shut
it down a decade ago. This road was causing
nearly 300 deaths per year. But I got the government's
permission to reopen it just for us. I really wish they hadn't done that. Ah, it’ll be fine. I'm not sure that it will. I’m startin' to understand
why they call it Death Road. You're not driving like it's
Death Road, I’ll tell you that. Yeah, when your life is in my
hands, I don't like when you say ”Oh!” No, your life is in my hands. And
look, the steering wheel just jerked. Hands on the wheel, please! We're like seven inches
from falling to our death. You're getting too close to the edge. Please. Please, please, please, please! Oh, my God, my life is flashing! It's flashing over and
over and over again! And if you thought that was a close call, we're about to hit the first of the
three deadliest spots on our route. This is where the road gets very thin! This is the part you
gotta be really careful on. Oh, my gosh. Dude, I mean, the tire is going to
go off right up here. Do you see that? Yeah, I see what you're saying. Oh, my God! Look how far down that is. Here. Nolan, can you guide me? Gladly. I'll get out of
the car. Gladly, bro! Don't fall, please. No way! Look at how steep the drop is. That's a whole ravine.
There's, like, a waterfall. Yo, help me get through this. All right. Dude, this looks crazy! Look how close we are to the ledge. Your tire is literally right
next to this giant ravine. That is crazy. Watch out! It goes down.
It's very slippery. Keep comin'! Nolan, you're not really good
at this whole “directing” thing. I mean, I feel like I'm just running
away from the car at this point. Not much direction that I can give. All right, get in the
car. You're useless. Okay. You get in, too. I'm 'bout to speed up. Nolan, you know what might
make this ride a little more fun? What? Our brand new Feastables
Creamy Peanut Butter Cup! Oh, I thought you were
going to say you driving slower. No. Oh, jeez! It's getting so foggy
coming up. I can barely see. At some parts, the road
is actually pretty normal, but due to extreme elevation
change here in Bolivia, sudden blinding fog can
roll in as a silent killer. All right, stop, stop, stop. It’s the edge. Am I good, Nolan? No. It actually looks like they're
about ready to fall. It is so close. Okay. So, like, right here? Good? Just stay as far away Ah! What's that noise? It's closer than I prefer, but... I thought, why don't we mix things up and
come out with our own Feastables cups? No! You see, the best part about these cups is that we use peanut butter straight
from a jar, and look how jam-packed it is. These things taste amazing. And on top of that, we use
Feastables chocolate in this. Which, if you don't know, at Feastables,
we pay all our farmers living wages. We use Fair Trade certified beans.
We remediate child labor on our farms... Oh, my gosh. This is very bumpy. All three of which no big American
chocolate company does. Nolan. It's been like a decade. Can you
go make sure that bridge still works? All right. I just really want to make sure if it
collapses, you know, I'm not...on it. All right, Nolan, test
the bridge! Am I good? It's good. Big Chocolate pays farmers so little that they're forced to
literally use child labor. No joke, there's over a million kids
in illegal child labor in West Africa just on cocoa farms. So not only should you try the new
cup because it tastes phenomenal, but also help me send a
message to the chocolate industry. Pay your farmers a living income and do more to get rid of
child labor on your farms. This was crazy! We survived Death Road! So far, we've survived on the land. But for this next bonus place, Karl and Nolan are in the middle
of the ocean surrounded by sharks. And we're gettin' in the water
without a cage for some reason. Yeah, we usually use this
thing, but now we're not going to. The sharks in these waters are
notorious for unprovoked attacks, making this the most dangerous
water in the United States. I can't believe this is happening. Oh, my gosh. These are gigantic
sharks. Oh, my God! Dude, why are we
doin' this without a cage? Dude, behind you, behind you! Oh, my God, it's huge. Nolan, get in now! I don't want to! Hopefully I don’t die. I
don’t wanna die today. Oh, my God, that thing is so big. Okay. All right. All right. Karl, the sharks are,
like, twice as high. I'm good on sharks. I'm good. But that was nothing compared to
our second most dangerous spot. Which just so happens to be in
the middle of the Amazon rainforest, the beauty of which can only
be paralleled by its danger. Because in a matter of moments,
the forest can go from this... to this. Just a little rainstorm can
cause the rivers to flash flood and overwhelm the entire area. And today we're visiting
the Gocta Cataracts waterfall, where a flash flood could send us down
over 1,000 feet... to our watery grave. And to join me on this cloudy day... I brought these guys! You'll remember Hase, he spent
seventy days in the wilderness, and Bailey spent 100 days
trapped together in a cube. What we're about to do
seems more up his alley. They said the chance of death is low. - Wait, what?
- Not zero? Come on, boys, let's hit it. And after hours... And hours... ...of trekking through
some of the most slippery and at times, steepest terrain
mankind has ever set foot on... Nothin' to see. ...we finally made it to our destination. That's a waterfall... right there! Like if you slip, you're dead. And with the help of a guide, we
were able to cross the river safely. Hey, look! And then we were secured to some ropes so that we could look over
the edge of the waterfall. Can you see over? Wow! This is so gorgeous! But as I said before, for
how beautiful this place is, at only a moment's notice... it can be just as deadly. And it just started
downpouring like crazy. You know, this is why this is one of
the most dangerous places in the world. This waterfall is now
becoming wider and wider, which are creating flash flood conditions. So we're literally getting flooded out
of the Amazon right now. We gotta go! Should we use the ropes to go
down the side of the waterfall?! I don't think so. That's
really a bad idea, Jim. We're going to be in the woods. Isn't
that just equally as bad? What's the risk? There's mud coming down
on Jimmy’s line. Like, a lot. And at any point, they
could be struck by lightning. And I really don't want you to die. So with our YouTube video
turned emergency operation, the only way out was through
the same steep and slippery terrain that got us here, and now we had to do it while
the entire forest was flash flooding. You can see the flash flooding.
Now the path is blocked off. We’re gonna have to
rope off multiple parts 'cause it’s gonna take us
hours to get off this mountain. Do you remember when I crossed
this river and I was laughing? I'm not laughing anymore. I'm actually scared. And if I fall, that's the
waterfall right over there! Look at this water.
Like, seriously, no joke! Grab the rope and pull yourself up. Don't let me die. And after hours and hours
of trekking through the floods and muck, we walked away
from this mountain with our lives. Now we're headed to the
most lethal corner of Earth. The number one spot on our
list of the world's deadliest places. And what better way
to end this video, boys, than the most dangerous island
on the planet... Snake Island! Why are we going to an island filled
with killing machines? We might die. Bye-bye! And we are now officially
stranded until tomorrow. That's right. We will be spending the
night on the most deadly island on Earth, and with lethal snakes
hidden beneath our every step, these specialized shin guards
were our only hope of protection from their venomous bites. So there could just be
snakes anywhere here. Yeah. Jimmy, what happens if
one of these snake bites us? Basically, as soon as the
venom enters your bloodstream, your skin melts off, and you
could be dead in under an hour. Well, it's kind of terrifying to think
that I could just die at any second. This is wild, bro. You know, for an island full of killing
machines, this is actually very pretty. This is so beautiful from up here. Man... If you fall right here, you're dead. Yes. I see that. Boys, be careful. You'd think that with a
name like Snake Island, there would be thousands
of snakes out in the open. But after killing all of
the ground animals, the snakes now hunt the birds in the trees the island's only remaining prey. We are officially entering the jungle. At any point now, a snake could
jump from the tree and bite us. I was just worried about my legs, but now we've gotta be worried
about them falling from trees, too! This is insane, bro. There's one right here. There's
one right here right next to my face. By capturing the snakes, scientists can extract their venom
and create anti-venom with it. Wait. That's venomous. Yeah. So if that bit me, I would die. Yeah. Hey, make sure you got a good grip. It's a juvenile. Oh, no. No! It's gone. You... dropped it. No, it escaped. It escaped. But... He’s as chill about dropping
that snake as I am when I drop my phone. And the further in the jungle we get... These bushes are too thick. I can't see two feet in front of me.
A snake could pop out any second. The more snakes we see. Here and there... This time, let's not lose 'em, okay. Okay. Scoot back. Scoot back. How many lives will the
anti-venom from that snake save? Thousands of lives. Oh. That's insane. The anti-venom they create can be used to treat 90 percent
of all snake bites in Brazil, which means every snake we catch
could mean thousands of lives saved. Hey, Jimmy, there's
another snake up there. Oh, my God. That one's huge! We’re finding 'em all
now. They're coming out. So for the rest of the day, we helped find these deadly snakes,
and we even assisted the scientists with their research. So that snake is about 15 feet in the air, and the scientists propose we
shake the tree so we can get it. There's no way I'm
campin' under those trees. That thing ain't moving, dude. We need that anti-venom.
They can save lives. At this point, it was getting dark,
and we needed to focus on survival. Time to build camp. Camp is now set up. Full disclosure, I have
no idea if these tents are snake proof. We'll be sleeping among the snakes. A little bit scary. About to go to sleep. Hopefully a snake doesn't
slither in my tent tonight. This is terrifying. I can't wait to be in the
safety of my own home. So, we woke up with
one thing on our minds.... Getting off this island as fast as we can. I just wanna go home. From hanging off the side
of a massive ice mountain to driving inches away
from a 1,000 foot drop, swimming in shark infested
waters with no cage, and lastly... We survived Snake Island, and no one died! Thanks for watchin' the video. Make sure you go try the brand-new
