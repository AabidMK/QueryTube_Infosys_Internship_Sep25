2n5h3VFdxSE,Saving The World From Your Sofa,"Dora Moono Nyambe chose the difficult path so that she could protect and love the most vulnerable children. Dora passed away on Christmas morning.

My favorite quote is ""What you share with the world is what it keeps of you.""

Dora your legacy will live in the hearts of so many who learned how it felt to be loved and valued because of you, who learned the meaning of courage, conviction, compassion, and dedication because they had such a powerful example in you.

You were taken too soon but your legacy will persist in so many lives that were so deeply affected by you.💔

Dora has an incredible team that can continue to provide a loving and stable environment for these children, but most of the revenue to run the village was earned on Dora's TikTok stream. They are going to need our help. Please give whatever you can to help us preserve Dora’s legacy. You can click the Donation button or visit https://www.beastphilanthropy.org/campaign/we-rebuilt-a-village 
100% will be forwarded to Footprints of Hope

This has been such an exceptional year. Together we have been able to make a profound difference in the lives of so many around the world. We have learned together about some of the most difficult challenges humanity faces, viable solutions to those problems, and the exceptional people fighting to build a brighter future. We couldn’t do any of this without YOU, and we are so incredibly grateful for your love and support.

GiqdbZLq0oM,We Rescued Kids Living in a Garbage Dump,"When young children have to dig through toxic landfills in hopes of earning enough money to buy a simple bowl of rice, we have failed as humans.  This is not an Indian problem. It is a global problem that should bother each and every one of us. Poverty has no boundaries. Please don’t look the other way anymore. Together we can fix it by supporting incredible groups like Tiljala Shed (https://tished.org/). 

Sometimes we see a problem that seems so insurmountable that we ignore it thinking “What difference will $5 make?”  It makes a huge difference because thousands of small donations add up very fast, but thousands of people deciding their contribution is too small to make a difference leads nowhere. Please give what you can. Apathy is our enemy. 

Started by Alamgir, and now run by his son Shafkat, Tiljala Shed is an outstanding organization. They are committed to helping as many children as possible by giving them dignity and opportunity. Please consider donating to help.
https://tished.org/donate/
International Donors: https://goto.gg/32034
Indian Donors: https://give.do/fundraisers/tiljala-shed-education

While we were in India we were told many of the children in the program came from households where there was not enough food to eat every day. Massive shoutout to The Smith Brothers Family Foundation for their incredibly generous donation to feed all these families for the next two years.

And finally, in a shocking, yet unsurprising (I know that doesn’t make sense, but its how I feel)  act of generosity, Tony and Sage Robbins, after watching a prescreening of the video, instantly offered to support this entire program, including the at-home meals for these kids and their families 
for an entire additional year.

Poverty is a global problem. What is depicted in our videos is not intended to represent the entire country, or its people. Every country has its poor.  We wish to draw attention to the issues that challenge humanity across the planet, build empathy, offer relief where we can, and inspire others to do the same. We can only change the world together.

When Beast Philanthropy first began accepting donations, we got more donations from India than any other country. This was foreshadowing for this trip. The people of India are kind and generous and we were humbled by their kindness and hospitality.

Dr. Kiran Modi and Deepak have given so much to help so many. They are perfect examples of what we can all accomplish when we choose to give from the heart. Deepak, one of the most giving people we have ever met, has written a book, with all sale proceeds going to the NGO Udayan Care, or you can donate directly to support these incredible people at http://www.udayancareusa.org/

a6U6AobyWtw,Saving Endangered Animals From Extinction,"This Maasai Mara Conservancy program, led by the Maasai people, has proven to be extremely successful. It provides an economic model that not only preserves the land, animals, and the Maasai way of life, but also offers the potential to significantly expand the protected areas. In total there are 24 conservancies that now work together under the Maasai Mara Conservancy. Only 7 had access to the tools and technology needed to track environmental conditions and generate carbon credits that can be sold to continue and expand  this incredible program. We paid for an additional 7 power and weather stations, and committed to pay for 5 more, bringing the total to 19. Let's band together and raise the money to pay for the last five remaining conservancies together. We’re so close to getting something so important complete. Please click the Donate button, or visit this link to help save these animals, this land, and the Maasai people who live in harmony with the earth.
