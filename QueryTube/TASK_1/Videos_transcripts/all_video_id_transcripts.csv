bGhSZLdGFEQ,"In a way, it's not about like me or us and our beautiful ideas. It is about the why we want to do it and who else is it for and knowing that there will be benefits to many other people um if we can find a way to get it right. [Music] Love how your career has been on like disrupting the status quo, kind of breaking those structures down. You did it at Kickstarter and now with your new artist corporation structure like let's just like take it back almost. Um, why has it been important to shake the institutions and these like normal ways of working? My first thought was I've never felt like I belonged anywhere. Wow. Okay, we got to unpack that. Yeah. Yeah. Like I grew up on the country on a farm. I loved books. I didn't, you know, just it wasn't how what am I doing here? And that always created kind of a hyper awareness. Another word is anxiety. Another word, you know, but just uh a feeling of not totally fitting in. And um I've never really been a part of any institution. I've never been really blessed by I mean this this TED this stage is certainly an amazing exception. Very excited about uh but I've just never had the option to be a part of those things. you know, I went to a high school in the middle of nowhere, very rural area. I didn't Yeah. I don't have no connections. Like, so just those things are not for me. And so, anything I've done, it's always been I have to figure out what's my weird way. And I'm again that not belonging causes me to be off often very self-aware of what I'm doing. And so, I'm like doing something while having some understanding of maybe why I'm doing it. and through that like a deepening I don't know this is like retrospectively I'm saying this is what's happening um and so so I would say it's because I don't have a choice uh I would also say it's often annoying like as a kid yeah as a kid I just wanted to fit in I just wanted to fit in I remember one year before like seventh grade my mom and I go in the mall and I'm just like let's only buy the clothes that I know the other kids who I'm not like wear and I went to school wearing those clothes and it's like they still could tell what what what a ripoff. Uh and so so you know but as you learn how to be yourself you know I think the things that are the things that hold you back when you're younger are your strengths when you're older and and so it's just now it's just kind of just how I it's like my my gate, you know, it's how I walk. Yeah. Yeah. Um, and it's often annoying. Well, I feel like that I mean they say like let's say in school and you're really expected to conform to this pretty set framework of what like a good student looks like and then unfortunately schools just sort of like be a robot, repeat these things back to me. Yeah. And then it's I think there's sort of a belief that the ones that are a little bit not the right that don't fit Yeah. or stand out or even almost like struggle in that environment will be you know almost like nurtured in the right way. The folks who will make the greatest change at some point later on. And it's just more that in this time and place that wasn't the right. Well, I think I think anytime you're having to like whether you want to or not, confront some obstacle or overcome, you know, I'm left-handed and I'm having to learn guitar, whatever, there's like all kind like so many things, but like that that extra step deepens your way deepens your understanding of that thing. Yeah. And and ultimately I think like really accelerates the exceptional like your ceiling even and in a way that again if you're just like following following the path doing the right things you will arrive at like oh you're a professional right but yet someone else might be the entrepreneur that like yeah you're the SVP at a big company but they have made their own company. Yeah. And and I think a lot of it is like yeah that I I mean it the opposite of this way but some people come out wrong like I came out wrong you know you know and but but like but like uh but then you just force your way through the world and uh and that process really teaches you I think ways that the world works which is something you are dealing with these days. How what made you like how did this thing you're doing start even? Yeah. Um so it started with hearing a fact for the first time that a third of the food that we produce worldwide is lost or wasted before it ever has a chance to be eaten. That was an FAO report um the UN food and agriculture organization in 2012. And um our founder, James Rogers, um heard that and was just sort of like, wait, what? And sometimes you hear something that you can't unhear. And I think especially quite close to us because where we're located in Santa Barbara, California. We're surrounded by these fruits and vegetable fields, especially if you're driving between where we are and you head up into Northern California. And it's pretty crazy suddenly to have it in front of you to see this food that we're growing and then just almost like well imagine just especially for fruits and vegetables like take half of it off the plate and you're sort of like this can't be possible. We're in the 21st century. Um this is the best we can do kind of. Um, so it was I would just treat it as like the thing you can't unhear. Um, and then it sits with you and it sort of nags at you for a while and um, and then you feel compelled like what can we do about that? What do we what can we uniquely contribute even to maybe trying to figure that out? So then as material scientists, chemists, engineers, it was like just then starting to ask some really basic questions like what okay why did why is there food waste like how do plants decay or spoil today? How do they protect themselves? What is that? Like so it's just like really probably the benefit of a beginner's lens or mind on this because we don't come from food or agriculture and so almost and hopefully not being trapped by or being blinded by the things that are immediately in front of us but you lose track of and you just accept how they are. So anyways that's how we got started and um really kind of grateful for that journey. It blends all these things that we talked about at the very beginning. It's like I love science and engineering. So we have a technical problem. I want to put that towards something I would deem as like meaningful and impactful use. And so helping especially healthy foods last longer that which I wish all of us were eating more of, you know, for our own kind of health and benefit like all those things and laded up so well. So it was sort of like I don't know if this is going to work but it sure seems like worth trying. You're going to do it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And how about for you then like you know call it the spark or fundamental um core issue that you were trying to unpack. I mean, I think basically all my work always starts with uh like why Yansy sad and just like a dumb self interrogation and for me it was uh like I'm a writer and I was building an audience. I was running a community and doing a lot of stuff and having success with it and I felt very lonely all the time and um tried to elevate people to be a part of it with me and just never the dynamics were off and yeah I just felt unhappy. I was doing what I loved and I felt unhappy doing it and I um ended up just like pausing for a bit like for a month and I just read a lot. That's what I do. I just read. I read old and random. And I read two things in the same week. Uh, one about history of hardcore and punk bands, which is my world. And how in all cases they made such weird music, no record label with put them out. So, they had to put themselves out. But to put themselves out, they just made up a fake record label name, a logo, and a PO box. Love it. And you print it and then you self-leimitimize. But what would always happen is by the time the first record would come out, like four other people would come and be like, ""We make music like you. Can we be part of it, too?"" And it made me see that something like a punk label is not just putting out music, it's manifesting more punkness. Yeah. It's teaching people the world view, how to adopt it. And that same week, I was learning about the history of the Royal Society. Began 1660 in London. and Christopher Ren and other natural law scientists start meeting in a pub on Thursday nights because they're annoyed that facts are determined by the church and the king. So they start a club with the motto of take nobody's word for it. And in 1664 they published the first Zen philosophical transactions which is people just trying experiments experimenting with the idea of experiments and that those pages is like funded the Babage machine where Isaac Newton published uh Benjamin Franklin's kite experiment peerreview scientific method all created through that process and I came to feel like those two projects a punk label and the Royal Society are the same thing. We brought it back to the beginning. It is it is an it is yeah it is an umbrella. It is some some organization that stands for a purpose. It is open to anyone who reflects the criteria and promotes that same purpose. And there's like some sort of economic or rules that determine how it functions together. But I came to see that like across history that's been the most powerful form of culture creation ever. But um but yeah, but I ended up like had that observation and wrote it up for myself and I wasn't sure what to do about it. And I ended up sending it to like five people who I'd thought about when writing it who are people who run projects like this. Some of them I knew, some of them I didn't. And I reached out and I had just attached a Google doc and I said, ""Hey, I'm working on this thing. It's not public, but I wrote this while thinking of you and really curious to know what you think."" And all five people wrote back and all five had some reaction of like, wow, I've never thought of it this. I've never seen this meta. I've never seen this thing. And that feedback sort of fed that this is real. And that that process led to the ultimately to seeing to building a tool for that sort of project to exist today. And then to imagine how those sorts of projects could legally become powerful, could become wealthy, could become bigger than how we think of a artist's role today. But like it really did begin with uh just trying to understand my own unhappiness with the situation that was to my liking. Yeah, I'd made the situation I wanted, but I did not enjoy it. and trying to figure that out for myself has just led to well, you know, in my in the talk I gave I I talk about how in starting Kickstarter there had been a wall and we built a door and um that had been in the talk for a while and about a month ago I was reading uh the hero with a thousand faces which is a book by Joseph Campbell and this is where the hero's journey idea comes The hero's journey is, you know, you kind of get the kicked out of you. Uh, you're called to return. You deny it. You don't want it. You have to go deeper. You go deeper and then you and then you return. And the the pivotal moment is that you find transcendence. And and across every uh society myth says there's similar sort of shape to the story. But the trick to transcendence, transcendence is a door. And the door of transcendence is all around us. There's like 12 right here between us right now. The doors of transcendence are everywhere. But there's a trick to doors of transcendence. Doors of transcendence are locked in very specific ways. And he writes that the doors of transcendence are always locked by opposites. Light and dark, life and death, or as I saw when I read it, artist corporation, exact opposites. But opposites lead you to think that there is no space between them. But in the hero's journey, because you've gotten the kicked out of you and because you like just see it differently now, you perceive the crack. And the final stage of the hero's journey is to identify that. And by identifying the doors and opening them and returning and telling people, you open the doors for everybody and that is the point of the journey. But it's always locked by these opposites. And it's like there's so yeah like that's the deepest truths the grandest things are in finding our way to those to that hidden door. And again it's just like the the glory of the universe. The trick of the whole it's all it's all like it's all in chorus with itself. it's harmonizing with itself and these things just give us a hint of like what's actually a play but there there is a mix of like it's an honor and it's a responsibility and it's a duty and there's a lot of a lot of feelings that go into it and you know learning about what you are doing I'm thinking oh what a great every wow everybody's going to love this like what a what a great thing and then to hear uh you have opposition there are forces that oppose this there. Maybe people don't care, you know, maybe the world you see is very hard for someone else to see. Yes. And yeah, how do you carry that? Um, maybe that goes back to a little bit your previous question almost like why what like why do I identify as a scientist? Why do I love science? Um, and it had always been, and I don't I'm sure just positive influences from different places in my life. It was like, um, how do you do something that's like doing good? Um, wanting to spend like our time, all of our we're all here on borrowed time, you know, our our time is finite. And so, how do you make the most of that? And that has been at least for me to find ways to serve or do good to elevate almost our collective quality of life if possible. So I guess in the face of opposition it's like the conviction I guess that uh is tested as to whether or not um you know you kind of stay on the course I guess that you're on. Um, and I think thinking about like um the knowing that there's like an entanglement of systems or incentives or whatever that's kind of got us all trapped. And just don't accept those things as inevitable and that it will take some kind of commitment to action. And you've also maybe got a willing willing to do that and know that it may not even be solved like in your lifetime, but that's the path that's worth walking. Yeah. If that makes sense. So, um, and then I guess in that sense it's helpful because in a way it's not about like me or us and our beautiful ideas. it is about like the why we want to do it and who else is it for and knowing that there will be um benefits to many other people um if we can find a way to get it right. So it's definitely a you know a challenge of like resilience. Yeah. But we also know that I mean I think you know your own stories you know encountering the same kinds of things like um so it's also inspiring though to like meet other people everyone's got their own version of the fight I guess and uh how do you not like the hard let the hard days win kind of is actually really tapping into others who are on on a journey of of their own um sharing their stories and just going like man like taking energy I think from that. So I mean I think about like the you know what you shared at this TED this year with regards to this artist corporation I thought like to me it's so impressive because when we work within certain bounds like you almost like as a common person you work within legal bounds. you've gone and you've created a whole new legal structure. And so I have a bazillion questions about like where do you start? Who do you need to convince? What else needs to change in order to sort of like accommodate that? And so like can somebody today go and actually register themselves or incorporate as an artist corporation? But like that's such a perfect example of at least for me as a rule follower like but the laws are you know shaped in this way and where is there really like room to carve this out. So I don't know would love to take it from almost like us trying to figure out what's the resilience that you need to sort of walk through this but actually hear your direct example of how did that like what's the first two steps or something you know that you had to walk down well I think it always helps even when people are opposing you I think it helps to empathize and because I think everyone generally People are op people are operating rationally within their local maximum. Yes. Yes. Yes. But can you change that? Yeah. And it works best if you can crawl into someone's bubble with them and look into the world together and by the time you're done talking you know it's move forward eight steps and like people are open to that I think in in certain circumstances but we all we're all resistant to being wrong because that means changing you know changing means that we were wrong or had to move. So like those are gentle things to do. But um yeah, I mean the artist corporation idea is um it's a it's well first it's just teaching me more about how the universe works and uh I previously co-ounded Kickstarter and uh and the last time a new corporate structure was made in the United States was 2012 and it was a public benefit corporation structure. M and uh Kickstarter was one of the first companies to become one of those and so we closely followed as the process was happening as was being passed as a law and states and yeah just had a bit of an inside view into that and uh it just registered to me that it was very technical and very esoteric but like it happened. Yeah, it happened kind of because it is so technical and esoteric. It's just it operates at a very different frequency than right other things we're aware of, right? And like who's really going to like dive into that? Who's going to care that much? Who's going to possibly care that much? And so I just happened to have seen that before. And then when I ran into like personally ran into a wall with something I wanted to do and felt like I wasn't clear, wasn't clear what option to take, some part of my brain remembered, hey, there's that thing. and just, oh, could you do that thing on that thing? You know, could you add that to that? And uh and I have the blessing of experience that I feel grateful for every day. And the blessing of experience lets you know lets you know how to roll with those things sometimes. And so this this idea and feeling arrived at like my most capable moment as a human being until now. Until now. and uh and arrived with me being fortunate to know so many great people who could help with so many things of this I don't understand. Yeah. Do you I feel like the m the vibe the mood in the world right now is quite doomy. It's tough. It's doomed. Yeah. Are you an optimistic person? Are you does like does that get you down? Do you like see over it? Uh, mostly yes. Probably depends a little bit on the day and that's okay. It's almost learning to give myself some kind of like grace through that. If you can look over a long enough period of time, it's almost like the things that matter, they kind of bubble back up to the surface. Even if there's a a time of disruption. Mhm. And maybe again maybe that's naive that in a way like what's good and right and really better for all of us like prevails in the end. Um, but I guess fortunately there's been so many examples in history where that pendulum, you know, does kind of navigate its way back and forth, but it's never sort of, at least to me, I don't feel like it's sort of gone in one direction forever and ever and and never been able to recalibrate or find its way back again. So uh that's kind of I think why I maintain a bit more of like an optimistic view is just that like uh if we look on a long enough time scale then enough of the right moments and drivers start to kind of click together to create a critical mass or a moment that allows like change to come forward. I don't know how else to describe it, but it's like what's at the root of all of our like malaise as a society that it can sometimes like uh devolve to such a state. Um there's a lot of noise. Yeah. A lot of noise. But how do you navigate according to truth? Yeah. And um it's a conscious mindset I think a little bit of some intentionality and not allowing yourself to just be pulled by what you see. Yeah. Yep. I think this is probably all of our time. Thank you so much. That was such a treat. That was awesome. Yeah. Awesome.",unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BzUb5MOysLo,"Recently, after a long day
of back-to-back meetings, I decided to treat myself
to some ice cream. So, leaving the office, I crossed the busy road
lined with solar panels, streetlights, ducked into a shop,
walked right past the vegetables, and back to the cookies and cream. This was in Kakuma,
a refugee camp in northern Kenya, home to 400,000 displaced persons, local Kenyans, solar-panel
streetlights and ice cream. Few camps in Africa
are as bustling as Kakuma, and it hasn't always been this way. Kakuma was never meant to be a place
for human potential to thrive. In the local Turkana language,
the word ""kakuma"" translates to ""nowhere."" When the camp was established, in the 1990s, it served as an important refuge
for those fleeing war in Sudan. But it was isolated, with extreme heat and poor infrastructure. Today, with over 10,000 businesses, Kakuma serves as the economic hub for over a million people
in the surrounding area. With a variety of shops,
cafés, yoga classes and nearly 100 million dollars
in market consumption each year, Kakuma is far from ""nowhere."" So what led to this remarkable
transformation, from remote refugee camp
to thriving community? Well, it's because of the ingenuity
and determination of the people who live there. Displaced persons and their Kenyan hosts,
together, building solutions to their community’s
most pressing problems. Because forward-looking
investors saw potential, private-sector companies took a chance, and the governments and UN agencies
advocated for entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs like Adela, who arrived in Kakuma
with no formal business experience, but who today employs 26 people
in her tailoring shop. And Mesfin, who runs the largest
motorcycle dealership in the county, and who covers
the school fees for 700 kids through his own philanthropy. These are just two examples
among thousands in Kakuma, proving what's possible when investment
unlocks human potential, a model that's sustainable and scalable
for displaced people around the world. A model more important today
than ever before, because tomorrow,
we could wake up to the headline that reads: “All assistance
for displaced people stopped.” A once-unthinkable
scenario is now plausible. We have to prepare for a world in which the 125 million
forcibly displaced people today have to fend for themselves. And we're witnessing accelerated crises, with wars in Europe and the Middle East
forcing even more people to flee. And climate change is triggering
floods in Brazil, fires in California, unlivable conditions across continents. As these trends continue, one in 10 of us
will be displaced in 25 years. One in 10. Each of us is more likely
to be displaced than ever before. The time for incremental change is over. We must do things differently. And yes, humanitarian aid
remains essential in emergencies and for the most vulnerable. But the widespread system, as it is today, was never designed with dignity,
or to be a long-term solution. Bold action requires us to change
our perspectives, partners and policies. For too long, displaced people
have been framed as burdens, and that thinking, that narrative,
has led to missed opportunities. Over the last decade, I've worked alongside 100,000 businesses
in five African countries, mostly in displacement-
affected communities. And these entrepreneurs, they have the traits that case studies
and business schools celebrate. They are resilient and resourceful. They innovate and adapt. They deeply understand their markets. They're the very leaders
and problem-solvers investors around the world seek but are rarely seen as investment worthy. Inkomoko, the organization
that I cofounded and lead, is Africa's largest lender
to refugee entrepreneurs, unlocking accessible capital
in communities too often overlooked by traditional finance. We've disbursed 25,000 loans, derisked by business advising
and skills development. And with a 97 percent repayment rate, we’re demonstrating
that displaced entrepreneurs are just as investible as any other. And we’re part of a growing
private-sector movement in Kakuma, where, already,
three commercial banks operate, the International Finance Corporation
has committed 20 million dollars in investments in risk-sharing facilities, and Kenyan entrepreneurs
are scaling hotels and supermarkets. And let's be clear, I don't think we should double down on the same unchecked capitalist practices that have led to today's
global disparities. Capitalism and markets are flawed. But when we design for inclusion,
they can be forces for change. When Uganda allowed refugees to work, the country's GDP increased
by nearly a billion dollars. Ethiopia reformed its policies, and now thousands of refugees
contribute in key sectors, like agriculture and manufacturing. When Rwanda, the country where I live, included refugees
in its national ID program, they gained access to health care,
financial services, and are growing an economy. Here's the truth. These examples, these African solutions, are what the rest of the world
needs to learn from. These are solutions
rooted in a shared experience, in hospitality, in humanity. A few weeks ago, I had dinner
with my colleague Kuku. He was a refugee
in Kakuma for nearly 20 years and the first person we hired there. He advised 1,000 businesses
in Kakuma's vibrant markets, equipping entrepreneurs
with financial skills, growth strategies and access to capital. But our dinner wasn't in Kakuma. It was in South Sudan, his home country. Like many displaced people,
Kuku's path has been anything but linear. He’s had to navigate complex systems and is one of the few people
able to return home. Leveraging his experience, he's part of our founding team
in South Sudan, an expansion made possible
by the audacious generosity of members of this community. He's still advising businesses owned by people who've had to flee war
and the South-Sudanese diaspora like him, returning home to rebuild their nation. They all just want to contribute
at their full potential. The data is clear --
the entrepreneurs are ready. So let's do what we know works. Investors, open your portfolios
to businesses owned by displaced people. Philanthropists, prioritize
funding economic inclusion, especially if you have a climate focus, as climate-driven
displacement accelerates. And entrepreneurs, recognize this 125-million-and-growing population
as viable customers. Academics and journalists,
shift the narrative, highlight the resilience and opportunities
in these communities. And policymakers, economic integration isn't charity. It drives regional peace
and shared prosperity. From Kakuma to California,
Syria to South Sudan, one truth remains: it's that humanity flourishes when people have the tools to succeed
and the belief that they can. The future isn't just
about preventing displacement, it's about seeing that the solution
to one of the world's greatest challenges lies within the people most affected -- displaced people themselves. And it's on the rest of us
to recognize this and invest in them. Thank you. (Cheers and applause)",unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

into the black box Is hoping for humanity
the most human thing we can do? And the AI says back to me, I don't know. (Laughter) More specifically, Hmm, I'm not sure
how to process your request. Please try a new prompt. I say to AI: Don’t feel too special. You aren't the first artificial system We humans carelessly
labeled “intelligent” Global capitalism was genius

one people over the last But with differentiation
came racism and caste, Littering our world

out of seemingly nothing. Haven't you seen my generation, the DIYers and binary defiers? We to extract wisdom

EnbfoFUFm2s,"I've always found it curious
how biologists study life. There's this saying, ""A biologist will learn
how a car works by poking at it, removing one part at a time, and seeing how it affects
the rest of the car. On the other hand, an engineer
will learn how a car works by taking it completely apart
and rebuilding it."" Take, for example,
the Human Genome Project, one of the biggest breakthroughs
of the last century. We spent over a decade mapping out
all three billion letters of our genome, the complete set of DNA. We thought that once we could read DNA
and apply that same principle, poking and dissecting
one letter at a time, that we could start
eradicating all human diseases. But instead, we began to realize
just how little we actually understood about the true function of DNA. As a researcher, I work on artificial intelligence
and trained as an engineer. I learn by building things
and understand by creating. Today, I want to share an idea that can fundamentally change
how we study biology and life itself. Instead of just reading and dissecting
DNA, we should be generating it. And we can do this
by treating DNA as a language: one that AI can learn to read,
write and, ultimately, build. This idea led myself
and a team of researchers at Stanford and the Arc Institute with a sort of moonshot: Can we generate an entire genome
from scratch using AI? Build life from the ground up? Now I understand the thought of feeding
the code of life into a generative AI is both thrilling,
and, perhaps, unsettling. But I came to realize
that if this was possible, it could unlock some of the most
powerful breakthroughs in science and medicine. But I'll be honest, we had no idea
if AI could actually generate DNA. In many ways, DNA is like a language. It has grammar, structure, sort of like sentences and paragraphs
that group together to form a story. And these stories are passed down
through evolution, generation by generation. For humans, it’s been hard to comprehend
these stories written in DNA in large part because of its scale. DNA is extremely long, and yet, at the same time,
sensitive to the smallest mistakes. Imagine trying to write
something the length of 30,000 books in a foreign language. And that when you're off
by a single letter, one of billions, this can mean the difference
between a healthy person and a person
with a life-threatening disease. And so to tackle these challenges,
together with my colleague Michael Poli, we developed an AI that could generate
extremely long sequences of DNA, 500 times longer than previous AI models, at high levels of detail. We assembled a team
of scientists and AI experts and gathered the largest collection
of DNA used to train AI, 80,000 whole genomes
fed into a model that we called ... Evo. And our goal was to create
something like a ChatGPT for DNA, where you can prompt Evo
and describe the DNA you want, and it would generate new sequences,
one letter at a time. But there is one key difference. With chatbots, you can
just read what it writes, and you can decide
if it makes sense to you. With DNA, it's not so simple. It's not an intuitive human language. How do you know if it's any real or good? What does that even mean? What we needed was a test, a way to verify that what it wrote
would actually function. And so we started with a familiar tool
in biology called CRISPR. CRISPR is like a pair of molecular
scissors that can edit DNA, used for things like gene therapy. We asked Evo to make its own, and generate its own version
of CRISPR from scratch, which had never been done before. It's got proteins and RNA inside, it's a complex system. And so our biologists
would take that generated DNA and analyze it to see
how realistic does it look, does it resemble something in nature? How do its proteins fold? Which all gave us a sense of its function. But ultimately, we have to test their ability to cut DNA
by actually building them in the lab. And so that's what we did. Now waiting for lab results can sometimes
be a nerve-racking experience. Honestly, it's kind of like waiting
for the results of a pregnancy test. You’re excited, anxious
and hopeful for a positive outcome. And then, all of a sudden ... these two little lines appear. Just to be crystal clear,
these two lines are a good thing. That's what we want. (Laughter) It means that our CRISPRs
cut a single strand of DNA into two, in the exact right spot,
just like natural CRISPRs in the lab. And so that's when we knew ... it worked. (Laughter) (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) What you're seeing here
is the world's first CRISPR system designed entirely by AI. Evo generated DNA that not only looked
realistic, but that actually functioned. And so next, we decided
to go for that moonshot, to try and generate
a whole genome from scratch. And Evo was able to generate
hundreds of synthetic proteins in a genome that resembled
those in nature. But ultimately,
it was missing a few parts. It wasn't yet complete, more like a rough sketch of the genome. However, this is just the first version. That rough sketch of the genome
will become more detailed over time. In fact, within years, we anticipate AI will be able to generate
whole functional genomes. In other words, AI will be able
to generate new life. As this technology improves, biology will shift
from discovery to design. What might this world look like? Let's look ahead. In this future, we can make
truly personalized medicine. Imagine prompting an AI like Evo
with your genome, finding sources of diseases, predicting your reaction to drugs, and guiding treatment options
based on your own DNA. But why even take medicine
when you might have a permanent cure? We might choose to alter our DNA outright, and we are beginning to see this today. Recently, the FDA approved the first
gene therapy for sickle cell disease, a painful, lifelong
condition of the blood. And it works by just changing
a single gene in a person's DNA to permanently cure the patient. And now, there are
over 500 DNA-altering treatments awaiting approval. But let's say you're not comfortable
with changing your DNA. What if we added new DNA? All of our DNA is organized
into 23 pairs of chromosomes. Chapters, if you will, in the book
that is our genome. What if Evo learned to generate
a 24th chapter? A whole new chromosome, equipped with all the machinery needed
to fight hundreds of diseases on demand. With DNA generation,
what is the limit of what's possible? We've all seen ""Jurassic Park."" We all thought it was science fiction. And it is ... mostly. Researchers are now reconstructing
the genomes of extinct species, with one company planning
to resurrect the woolly mammoth by as early as 2028. Now instead of bringing back
extinct species, can we create new ones? Researchers are now engineering
microbes for colonizing Mars. If we one day wish
to be a multiplanetary species, we'd have to figure out how to grow things
on Mars, make it more hospitable, and possibly terraform. And it is possible. We have microbes on Earth that can handle a range
of extreme conditions that we call extremophiles. Now I understand some
of these things might sound scary. One of the biggest concerns
is biosecurity, the potential to create bioweapons. Can AI be used to generate
more infectious viruses? Yes. But AI can also defend and monitor
against these threats as well. And so perhaps you feel like me in that you have to choose between
advocating for innovation versus safety. I'd encourage you to embrace both,
because stopping progress entirely, I don't think it's practical. We need to evolve with the technology, monitor its capabilities, and constantly be asking ourselves, ""What possible futures are we enabling?"" As humans, we've always sought
to understand the world around us. That is in our nature. But understanding alone
has rarely been enough. For centuries, we've studied life
by observing and dissecting it. But now, we're no longer
just reading life's code. We now have the power to generate it. And with AI, we’re at the beginning
of unlocking new medicines, science and even entire new forms of life. Do we make small edits? Do we write entirely new chapters? Or do we one day design life itself? Because to truly understand biology, we must create it. And the future of life,
it's ours to build. Thank you. (Cheers and applause)",unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
UmX4M4Np43A,"Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Yeah. Thank you. >> Hi everyone. Well, I am Joshua Bell and I am joined by a brand new orchestra that I just helped found in New York City called the Chamber Orchestra of America. Yeah. So you might you might ask, do we need orchestras anymore? >> Oh, thank you. Am I preaching to the choir? Okay, maybe. But do we need classical music anymore? Is it is it relevant? Well, good. Well, we all agree. I guess I could go. Okay, but but I'm here I'm here really to to answer that and and say yes. So, well, I want you to imagine walking into your hometown concert hall. You're there to hear the symphony. So, what happens there? Okay, you take a seat and the musicians start filing onto the stage. Each one of those musicians has spent a lifetime, tens of thousands of hours mastering their craft. And each instrument in their hands is a self piece of history, a testament to human ingenuity and creativity. The conductor walks onto the stage and he gives a downbeat and the room comes alive with the sounds of the symphony. Every note has a direction. Every harmony has a purpose. And you sit there in the audience being taken on a journey. Not just being entertained passively, but actively listening and using your imagination. And you're doing it alongside thousands of other people from different walks of life, different ages, races, religions, political persuasions. None of those differences at that moment mean anything because you're unified by the music and reminded of your shared humanity. So, don't you think we need that in today's world? Thank you. So, you've just heard a little bit of, as you probably know, Vivaldi, Antonio Vivaldi's Four Seasons, which he wrote 300 years ago in Italy. Uh, incidentally, my violin that I'm holding in my hand was made 5 years before that was written in 1713, just down the road in Cremona, Italy, by another Antonio, Antonio Stratavari. And uh, yeah, it's kind of amazing. And at that very same time, across the Alps in Germany, there was another man writing the most glorious music ever, and that was Johan Sebastian Bach. Now Bach was expanding and experimenting on the idea of what an orchestra could sound like. He created his monumental St. Matthew Passion which he wrote for two string orchestras on the stage at the same time. Double chorus wind soloists um vocal soloist. It's just the most immense and spiritual piece really ever written. And it's three hours long. So we're going to play just a tiny bit of it from its most really its most poignant moment. And that's the moment in this biblical story where Peter has just betrayed Jesus and he's stricken with remorse and regret begging basically for forgiveness. This is Baradik which means have mercy my God. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] [Applause] [Music] So just after Bach died, another genius was born and that was Wolf Gang Amadeus Mozart. Mozart wrote 41 symphonies in his lifetime. We're going to play a little bit from his 25th symphony which really marks the beginning of his middle period. Uh he was 17 when he wrote it. [Music] >> Yeah. So you That >> so that was that was Mozart's idea of a storm and you might remember it from the stormy opening sequence of the movie Amadeus. I don't you've seen that movie but it's it's one of my favorite movies. It's a great just a great story but I also love the film because it portrayed classical music in a in a wonderful light. uh when it came out, millions and millions of people bought Mozart records, you know, and many of those people probably had not ever stepped foot in a concert hall. And that really goes to show that classical music really can reach everyone. Uh but unfortunately, you know, classical music sometimes suffers from a bit of an image problem. You know, in popular culture, classical music is so so often portrayed as something boring or something for the elite or my favorite, uh, something relaxing, you know, that that you listen to in the background while you're doing something else. It reminds me of an ad from many years ago. I don't even remember what the product was, but I really remember the tagline because it really struck me. It was, the tagline was, ""It's like Beethoven, but with an attitude. So, Beethoven doesn't have attitude. [Music] Uh yeah, Beethoven Beethoven, you know, classical music is just so relaxing. [Music] Well, anyway, everyone knows that's Beethoven's fifth. It's one of the most popular tunes in the world. Everyone can hum it. It's almost cliche in classical music, right? But it's if you actually listen to this piece in its proper form with an orchestra live in a concert hall with all the winds and timony as well, it can be one of the most powerful experiences. We're going to do the last one because I want to show you about what really what the transformative experience is with the Beethoven symphony. And I hope any of you who've only know the first movement should listen to the whole thing. Beethoven takes you on a journey from the darkness and struggle of what you just heard the first movement to redemption in the last movement. C minor becomes C major. We have triumph over fate. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Yeah. When I think of beauty of melody, just sheer beauty, the composer that comes to my mind is France Schubert. I mean, Schubert wrote the most gorgeous melodies. Unfortunately, he died when he was only 31 years old, and most of his music was not performed or published during his lifetime. But he left us with the most beautiful songs, chamber music, and symphonies. So, we're going to play just a tiny bit from his now famous unfinished symphony. And you can listen to how this beautiful melody is interrupted by Schubert's idea of fate and the inevitable. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] [Applause] That's Schubert. Sorry to all these composers. We're only playing this tiny bit. It's not the way it's supposed to be. I wish you could play the whole thing. Oh, but anyway, you might ask, who are the Schuberts of today? >> I mean, does anyone write beautiful melodies for classical orchestra anymore? Well, I can leave you to be the judge of that. We're going to play a little piece written just two years ago. I commissioned my friend in New York, one of my favorite living composers, Kevin Puts, to write me a piece called Earth. Kevin Puts his homage, or you might say his love letter to our precious planet. [Music] [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Oh, heat, heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] Thank you. You know, the beauty of classical music is that the more times you hear these pieces, the better they get. I mean, they they take on deeper and deeper meanings for the listener and for the players. You know, um these pieces become part of you. They become your friends. They become your soundtrack for your life. So imagine if we didn't have orchestras anymore and these pieces that we just played and so many other great could never be heard. It would be like it'd be like having the Mona Lisa and Michelangelo's David locked up in a dark closet. It'd be this music would just be a pile of paper with dots on the page with just meaningless without the orchestras. Obviously that would be a tragedy. And so what are we going to do about it? Well, I think the answer is of course with our children and music education. I so believe in music education for kids. Um there's there's not a greater gift you could give to a child than the gift of music. And I wish every child had an opportunity to play in an orchestra. In an orchestra, they learn so many things. It's it's it's lifechanging experience. In an orchestra, a child learns about beauty and they learn how to listen to each other and to be part of something bigger than themselves. They learn discipline of course as well, but uh it's fun. I mean, playing an orchestra is just a blast. And I wish every town had a youth orchestra or multiple youth orchestras. I mean, how about as many youth orchestras as we have little league baseball teams? And hey, I love baseball. Well, I think we could make that happen. I really hope for that in the future. And on that note, I actually want to welcome a few new musicians to our stage. And these are members of the Vancouver Youth Symphony Orchestra who are going to they're going to join our chamber orchestra America. And thank you all um for our finale here, our little encore, you might say. And this is from Chaikovski. We'll end the session with this. And this is his serenade for strings. Thanks for listening. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat.

JreonVbDICI,"I say you can use social media to meet people but then really find your people. It is not a community. It will eat you alive in ways that you can't even begin to imagine if something goes wrong. You're watching Ted's How to Be a Better Human podcast. I am your host, Chris Duffy. Today we're going to unpack something that I have been struggling with for a while now. Should I be using social media for more than just looking at memes? Should I be using it to take political stances and to talk about issues that I really care about? Does that even matter? Now, for a long time, I would have had no clue how to answer that. And I really struggled to articulate a reason why it is so difficult. But then I read this book by Katherine Cross, and it is a thoughtful, nuanced, and provocative argument about social media. It's about how to balance our expectations for the internet versus what it is actually like to be online today. So today on the show, we are going to tackle those questions and so much more with Katherine Cross. >> Hi, I'm Katherine Alejandra Cross, PhD candidate at the University of Washington, researching online harassment for my sins and a widely published tech critic and assistant editor at Liberal Currents, also author of Log Off. >> There's so many things that I loved about um the book Log Off. I think you are very clearly not a cynical pessimist. you you very clearly believe in the possibility of positive change and I think that that is not often paired uh the idea that social media is a problem and yet there are ways that we could make things better but I also see that you responded in a way of like I don't know if I actually do believe in change. >> No, no, I actually I really genuinely do. It's like I say at the end of the book like it's not that I've lost faith in information technology or the internet. It's just that the idea that social media is going to do the hard work for us is going to organize us automatically in predictable and enduring ways that will lead not only to change but also take all of the difficult work, the busy work, the guesswork out of organizing around what comes after a big change event. Uh we have to dispense with those ideas. For instance, uh scholar at my university, Katie Pierce, you know, did research on Azabaijan and its civil society in the early 2010s, right at the apex of optimism about like the Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street and the fair protests that were burgeoning throughout South America, Chile and Brazil. But she was pointing out that in Azabaijan, authoritarians were already, you know, rather expertly manipulating social media memes and, you know, exposing people on the internet, harassing investigative journalists. And it was a clear warning sign that this idea that authoritarians were always going to be sort of these old fddy duddies who didn't know, you know, which way was up on a smartphone was not going to hold for very long and the dam was already breaking. But that's not pessimism. That's recognizing what has gone wrong. And you know that is the first step towards building something new. >> And I'm curious if you would agree, but to me I read Log off as in one part an argument against social media and in another quite large part an argument for the dayto-day hard work of politics and of community building. >> You know, I I love social media. I think it, you know, it's hilarious, but what it's not is a substitute for the hard work of politics, and it never can be. But we've often treated it that way where we see social media metrics as equivalent to votes or even to polling data. And that has, I think, led us woefully astray, let us all woefully astray. uh and you know I at the end of the book sort of tease a bit about my own dissertation in citing Hana Arant and her own work on what politics really means. She's often misunderstood and not easy to claim by either the right or the left and much criticized by both sides of the political spectrum partially because of the way that she conceives of politics as this uh continuum of the individual and the collective and argues that you can't dispense with either. What social media does is render us completely monatic individuals pretending that we are part of the collective. And so long as you and a thousand other people are staring at the same raw shack ink blot and seeing your private desires being met, you can act as a mass. But the moment that illusion dissipates, and it always does, the whole thing falls apart. And then there's nothing holding you together, not even ideology. Why is there after all so much leftist infighting on social media which is not a new phenomenon of course but wildly and dramatically accelerated thanks to social media to ever more destructive potential. So that's that's where I'm coming at with all of this. >> What is the simple quick definition of politics? >> Politics is the debate that you and I have about power and resources in our society. And so that takes on any number of forms. You think about how much falls under the heading of power and resources. It's pretty much everything, right? And it's therefore the air we breathe, the discussions that we have about, you know, whether a park should be built in our neighborhood are political. The discussions about how often does the recycling get picked up are political. The discussions about, you know, whether you get to have pets in an apartment building are political, but that also scales up to all of the issues that affect your life and mine in very profound ways. People get together in that way to ban books about LGBT people from their local library for instance, but they also band together to defend those books or come together on behalf of a say child is being bullied at school for being different. Politics is social at the end of the day. Politics is always bigger than one person. That is a huge part of politics. And so in order to achieve that, you can't just stand up and be your own little petty potentate on a street corner. You have to negotiate and network with other people, your neighbors, members of your community. That is the work. It's always social work. People sometimes talk about tech and everything as political. You say that social media may be anti-political. I'm just going to quote from the book here. How could that be? Because it demobilizes and scatters the polity. It makes it harder to come together, deliberate, and affect change in our communities. Worse, social media tricks us into thinking that that's exactly what we're doing. What results is a public square where real people can get heard, but nothing ever changes. You talk later in the book about how social media is a place where you can um make hate speech and harass someone, but you can't come together to build a community center. And that's really what I mean when I say that it's anti-political. Uh that it's and I use that provocative term very deliberately. It comes from my work with Hannah Arant and thinking about like what she means by politics and then saying that you know sort of social media is very antithetical to that everything that I described earlier. You know social media is a space that tricks you into thinking that you are engaged in collective action. People turn to social media as a quick and easy substitute for what used to happen through congregations and community organizations uh and activist groups and and volunteer and community groups and so on. Perhaps you know you are the only queer person in your town and a place like Blue Sky is the only place where you can talk to other queer and trans people on the regular and feel like you're a part of this larger community. It's not that people are stupid necessarily. It's that they feel like they have no alternative. But then because they feel like they have no alternative and they become more dependent on space like this, they have to sort of retroactively justify why they're investing so much energy into it. And it can't just be that, you know, I feel alone or lonely. It has to be I'm helping to save the world by doing what I'm doing. And that can lead to the more extreme manifestations of bad social media behavior in certain instances where people imbue their actions online with this righteous fury. It has to be, you know, that I'm saving the world. I'm defending the whole of this marginalized group or I'm defending democracy or opposing a tyrant. You know, there are only so many hours in a day. There are only so many, you know, things that you can do. only so much energy you have and at some point it does become a zero- sum game where you investing time into all of that is time you're not spending doing more meaningful real political work. >> Um so can we talk more about that for a second? The the ways in which it has pushed us away from sincerity, caring and um drawn us towards a contempt for this kind of political day-to-day work. Now I want to be very clear about this and say that yes there are very good reasons that people have become more cynical about politics over the last 40 years. There have been a lot of very real broken promises. Liberal democracy having been battered and in some cases stripped for parts on all sides has led to in some ways a failure to deliver on certain critical promises. But the flip side to that is that efforts to fight back, efforts to use the levers of politics to make real change have sometimes flown under the radar on left of center social media where if a politician say from the Democratic party makes a silly statement or appears to throw a minority group under the bus, right? or throws their hands up and says, ""Well, we can't do anything about X."" Uh, that gets a lot of attention, that drives a narrative, that gets a lot of rage clicks. But when there are quiet successes, then they remain quiet because they don't catch fire on social media because they don't fit into the narrative of ironic detachment that allows people to make this really funny dunking post on, you know, a kind of Dick Durban or Chuck Schumer type figure. the Biden administration for all of its sins stopped the uh you know drone war in Yemen at least before October 7th 2023. And so you know there was no credit given for any of that nor any attempt made online to sort of build on successes you know the rare successes that we could get out of government. And it reinforced this sense of cynicism. It made it seem, as I said, cringe to ever suggest that democracy was an unalloedied good, that liberal democracy was this cool thing worth defending. Uh, and I even see some revisionist history percolating across social media about the first Trump administration where people were trying to argue that, you know, oh, no one protested, right? That liberals didn't protest. All they did was make those stupid pink hats. And I'm just like, how can you remember the hats and not remember the protest that they were famously associated with, right? It is easier to destroy than it is to build. And that's part of the reason that it seems like, you know, the bad guys have more immediate successes than people trying to actually change the world for the better. But to build something much more constructive takes time and effort and it's rare that it happens. Like one of the few examples of it is something like crowdfunding but even that is very transient and itself a kind of rear guard action. The most popular type of GoFundMe is a medical fundraiser. And you know what does that say about our larger society for instance? That's not social media solving a problem. it's, you know, maybe at best a tourniquet on on an aspect of our society that's bleeding out. >> You've talked also about how your in your academic research you you say that you tried to give analytic rigor to the idea of a harassment campaign and and that in some ways social media is uniquely welldesigned to harass individuals because it they have three qualities. these harassment campaigns, what they are able to do is to have these, you call them third order harassment. So maybe you can just talk about the three orders of harassment and how social media is so well situated to make that happen to an individual. >> You have first order harassment, which is very extreme harassment that bleeds over into the physical world. So say, you know, dead animals in one's letter box or um people threatening your parents, say or showing up at your child's school or sending in a bomb threat to where you work, right? Second order harassment is what most people think of as online harassment. People saying mean things to one another directly to the target on social media. And third order harassment is sort of my uh innovation here where I argue that it's sort of this indirect but widespread layer of discourse about the targets of harassment that doesn't necessarily target them directly but provides the moral substrate for the harassment. the permission structure, the discourse that says it's okay to go after this target. Even if I don't personally do it, I'm having the discussions in public that help reinforce the idea that this harassment target is a legitimate target, right? And so you can think of first order harassment as things done to the target. Second order harassment is things said to the target and third order harassment are things said about the target and that creates a sort of base layer that justifies and allows to be itself to be built on to these ever escalating layers of harassment and abuse >> and these these situations they arise so often online that there are in some ways it's hard to pick an example. One example that we talked you talk about in the book is a a a woman who puts something on into social media about how she has some college-aged boys who live next door and they've been very quiet and so she likes them as neighbors. She thinks that they're very sweet neighbors, but she also notices that they've ordered in pizza five nights in a row. And so she she writes something along the lines of like, I kind of feel very, you know, caring towards these people. Maybe I'm going to cook them a big pot of chili and bring it over. And somehow that pretty innocuous message then becomes blown up online with people saying that this is the the embodies all the problems of of sexism and patriarchy that this embodies the problems of uh you know white privilege that this is and all these different pieces get start getting blown up online. And so there's direct attacks but then there's also this next level which is people discussing like is it actually okay? Is it not okay? What does it mean? what responsibilities do you have towards your neighbors? Even when people are not directly criticizing this woman, just by discussing the idea of like what does it mean to be a good neighbor, they're circling the energy around her so that she is more and more and more in the field of discussion which causes all this uh negative attention and hatred to come her way. In my uh brief gloss on third order harassment, I focused on people sort of justifying the abuse in a very direct way to one another that you know they could then bring to the target. But another critical point I make and one that's morally difficult for me, never mind for other people, is recognizing that even if you try to defend the target or you try to have some sort of uh neutral discussion about the issues raised by the harassment campaign, you are putting fuel on the fire that it is just all completely agnostic to intent. In that particular incident with the Chili woman, there was even like a Washington Post lifestyle piece about the, you know, ethics of making food for your neighbors. And I say something in the book along the lines of like just imagine how awful it must be to have this off-handed thing that you did out of kindness uh suddenly be debated in the pages of one of the nation's largest newspapers. Another example that I can point to was uh just from a couple of years ago this major Tik Tok blow up uh about couch guy. Basically, it was this innocuous video of a bunch of young collegeage men sitting on a couch like watching a movie or something and then one of their girlfriends comes in by surprise. Young man seemed almost nonplust. It was just like he had a bit of a deer in headlights reaction. It was fairly ambiguous, but that was the problem. It was ambiguous and therefore everybody wanted to debate and have an opinion about it. Oh, is he cheating on her? Does he not really love her? Are they about to break up? Is he a serial killer? This metastasized into this unbelievable lifuining uh discourse about this one poor guy. He ended up writing a first person perspective piece for Slate magazine about how much it had upended his life. And you know, he was relatively sanguin about it and he tried to be goodnatured, but he didn't sugarcoat like how incredibly disruptive and even violent that this had been by becoming this huge Tik Tok meme that was sort of dissecting this uh brief moment in time for him. And that also is a clear example of like the sort of third order at work. There were certainly a lot of people just talking about him, making videos and remixes about him that were not directed at him, right? They didn't like personally send it to his inbox, but it kept the fire going. It kept the meme going, which kept him at the center of all of this. Kept him at the eye of the storm. And that's sort of the the dynamic that I try to pick apart here. The the difference between me and other people who've criticized social media is that they often dwell on issues of individual morality and ethics like you are choosing to rot your brain therefore you are a bad person or there's something wrong with you or you are an addict and things like that. And I don't want to say that there's never any salience for that kind of discussion. I never want to say that individual responsibility is completely p. But I'm sociologically trained. I try to shift the focus to the larger social questions. Why do we do what we do? What are the strings by which we have been moved? And that has always fascinated me far more about social media. There is this structure there as much as the structure of a a city or highway network. >> This is also I thought such an uh for me a really eye-opening insight about social media. The idea of affordances. Uh an affordance is basically you can think of it as a feature of a designed object that suggests how to use it. So the example that I always use with my students is think about like how you open a door, right? If you see a push bar, it suggests that you have to push it to open. If you see a handle, it suggests that you have to pull it up or down in order to open the door. And you see a knob, you twist it. The shape, the way it looks, suggests how it is meant to be used. And that scales up varying degrees of complexity, right? And up to and including social media. So how social media is designed suggests how you use it. And I use the analogy of road design. So for example, in many countries there are raised crosswalks, right? You know, think about how if you live in the US or Canada, uh, you're used to like stepping down into the street to cross, but in other countries, the crosswalk is raised. So, the level is the sidewalk, and cars have to go over a speed bump essentially whenever they cross a crosswalk, which incentivizes them to slow down, right? And this is why you see, for example, a country like the Netherlands has a lower traffic fatality rate than the United States. It's not because the Dutch are better, more moral people or better drivers. It's because the design of roads influences behavior that you can start to scale up at the level of society. And that's the thing that I've always thought about as a scholar of the internet is that you're never going to get very far just telling people to change individual behavior. The real change, the structural change comes from changing the structure and because it it incentivizes and disincentivizes certain types of behaviors. when you see a link preview that has a headline, right? You can click through it and see, you know, what the article actually says, but you're much more likely to just read the headline only and react to that. That incentivizes them to create maybe misleading or provocative headlines. And so that's all social media affordances all the way down, right? It's not about individual morality. resisting it as an individual is exceptionally difficult because we all want to participate in society. We all want to participate and have fun and be part of something. And so it can be easy to let yourself get secondarily socialized into uh certain social media patterns, certain uh ways of behaving, ways of approaching things, ways of talking about certain issues uh and ways of interacting. just because you, you know, see everybody else doing it and because the design of the platform itself incentivizes it, people are not uh more brutish or cruel or stupid than they were in centuries past. If anything, I think frankly the opposite is true, but it's that we are being channeled into the these series of structures that incentivize certain behaviors and you have to swim upstream in the channels of those structures uh in order to avoid the direction that these affordances are kind of steering you into. Do you believe that we would be better with no social media if social media was banned or could somehow you could snap your fingers and and social media could stop existing in in its current form? Do you think that would be better? >> Yes. Uh I don't believe that there's a good way to do that that would not empower governments in the worst way. But you know sort of mutatus mutandis magic wand waved. Yes, I think that we might actually be better off. >> Okay. So then let's with that statement made um let's kind of address some of the arguments that I think people would make against that. One of them is this argument that if I am a person from a um a minority community or a marginalized community and I live in a place where there are not people who I can directly connect with. Say I am a trans person in a small town. There's no one else who I know of who is trans in my neighborhood. um that that is like the quintessential argument for social media on on the liberal side. Well, then you get to connect with people out there in the world. H how do you respond to that if you think that social media as a whole should should not exist if it couldn't exist? >> What I tell people is that obviously we're not going to be able to wave a magic wand to get rid of social media. So working with the world as it is which is very important to me as a political first principle I say you can use social media to meet people but then really find your people. It is not a community. It will eat you alive in ways that you can't even begin to imagine if something goes wrong. The idea that social media has to be the only domain where you socialize has never been true. There's nothing stopping you from having a little Discord community. There's nothing stopping you from having a chat room, from having a signal chat. I mean, if it's good enough for the Secretary of Defense, it's good enough for you, right? And I'm not saying deny yourself. But I am saying that maybe the best way to use social media is as an index or as a phone book rather than as the place that you treat as a community center. >> What of someone who says, ""I hear what you're saying. I understand. I agree with it. The problem though is and I'm speaking as this person. The problem is the platforms that exist as they exist. What we need is a better different platform. What do you say to that person? >> I will say that I was that person for the better part of the 2010s enthusiastically. I pointed out earlier for example the whole thing about clickbait, right? One of the last things, good things that Twitter did before Elon Musk took it over was that they put in a speed bump where if you tried to retweet something that included an article link, you got a popup that asked you, ""Hey, did you read this? Did you click through this?"" Make sure you do that before sharing this around. And that kind of thing can be very useful for providing what's called friction to slow down the worst aspects of virality. There's lots of things you can do to improve, but I don't think you'll ever completely solve the problems because the problems are baked into the fact that we just are not built to deal with staring into this vortex of the raw power of millions of people's ids screaming at you all at once. This is where the power of your argument that it is not just log off from social media but that it is also get involved in politics get involved in community building like that doesn't have to be in person it can be on the internet but it is not a social media only thing and so for example it's not saying that I shouldn't post uh an Instagram story condemning the latest atrocity in whatever war it is. That's not saying that I get to not do anything. Far from it. It's just saying that that isn't the most effective thing that I can do and that what I should be concerned with and please critique me if I'm not getting this right. But it's that what I should be concerned with is doing something that actually matters. >> Yes. >> Not doing something. Period. >> Yes. Exactly. But what I also say in the book very clearly is that and is to say that you can even still use social media as long as you have a clear picture in mind with clear answers to critical questions. What am I doing? How is it connected to the movement? What is the goal that I'm trying to achieve? Is social media the best tool or a good tool to use to achieve that goal? And if you can answer those questions with more than vague pabum appeals to personal morality or appeals to something vague like raising awareness, then you might be on to something. When I was writing the book, one of the uh people that I cite extensively is the uh journalist and drone researcher Feain Greenwood. and they were running a very successful fundraising campaign for a Palestinian man and his family, you know, was trying to get them out of Gaza, right? And it took a significant amount of money to do this. This was well vetted. Feain knew and had worked with this man before and reporting on Israel and Palestine. It was a very worthy cause that they, you know, they had been criticized by some keyboard warriors for some of the same things that perhaps you've been criticized for. And they turned that harassment into attention for this fundraiser in a really successful act of uh social media jiu-jitsu that raised goodness, I forget the exact figure, but I think it was like $50,000 Canadian dollars or something like that. It was quite a lot of money that ultimately got raised for this man and his family. You know, I think that that was a clear instance of I know what I'm doing and I'm going to use social media to achieve a a narrow but clear goal that social media can achieve. Now, this didn't stop the war obviously, but it did ameliate the suffering of one family, which is something and that was very worthwhile. When it comes to, for example, Gaza and uh the the war there, for me, it has been, I think, significantly more productive on my end to engage in longer form ways rather than in shorter form ways. to read articles, to um write about it in a long form way, to to have conversations on a podcast where we can talk for an hour rather than to try and summarize in a sentence or two because I still to this day struggle to summarize anything about uh any of these complex geo political situations in one sentence because it seems like it's um in some ways flattening and exploitative to me to try and say here's my one, you know, hashtag phrase about it. The other piece though in addition to the length of the form is social media seems to me to be among many other problems uniquely bad at saying I actually don't know enough. I don't know all of the details. It is you know I come at this from the world of comedy and as a comedian the number one thing you're supposed to do on stage is have a strong opinion on anything right? Like you don't bring something up unless you have a strong opinion. Doesn't work. I think social media invites that same thing. You must have a strong opinion. You must not say, ""I'm curious to know more. I don't actually know the history. I don't actually know what is happening. I don't actually know what this thing means."" >> It's one of my first rules for interacting on social media, but that's because it's like such a a nasty place. Showing vulnerability is, you know, very difficult thing to do on these platforms without taking an enormous risk. I mean, honestly, that was part of what happened with, you know, the Chile woman, right? There was a lot of vulnerability >> uh and kindness being expressed there and that was almost an invitation >> and the irony of course being that vulnerability and kindness are the number one ways to in face toface interactions to build a connection to build solidarity to actually build a community. >> Yes. Exactly. you know, and I I think that these in-person interactions are indeed the way forward, you know, and you're you're right certainly that there's a lot to be said for the fact that we're not allowed to say or at least not easily say, ""Oh, I don't know enough about this,"" right? Uh and that longer form engagements or productions are generally just better. And the thing is sometimes when you say, ""Oh, it's nuanced."" People think that you're excusing, say, a war crime or something like that, right? Yes, absolutely. Well, no, it's straightforward. There are children dying and so on. And that's true. We can say that the morality of that is straightforward. What's never straightforward in politics is what do you do next? How do you change the the circumstances surrounding these immoral acts, right? That is the complicated conversation. It is important that people like you get involved in these complex geopolitical discussions because it involves things that might be done in your name, done with your tax dollars, done under the color of your country's flag. That matters and there is a certain collective responsibility that we all have to take there. But you're not going to achieve that fullest bloom of citizenship on social media. >> Well, Katherine, thank you so much for being on the show and thank you for writing this book. I I it was such a pleasure talking to you. >> Thank you so much for having me, Chris. It's always a pleasure to talk about this. Hi everyone.

7z7d3UIMiEY,"People in power don't like making it easier for others to gain power. And by definition, if we're going to triple or quadruple the size of the electorate, people who know how to win in this current environment are not going to like that. [Music] And what's the reaction? Like I I've seen your robots and like and I I always think they're kind of cute, right? Like is that the normal reaction or are there people who are abusive to them? Like what's obviously it it creates an impression on human beings. You know, we've designed them Yeah. to be um to be friendly and fun. Yes. uh because for every customer we serve, there's a 100 bystanders that have to see the robot first uh as it's getting there, right? The most surprising is people just get used to them so fast that that actually surprised me the most when I go to down to Los Angeles for example every now and then and see this magical box moving around and people are just on their phones and just indifferent which to me is a really good sign. It just say that's how quickly we can get Yeah, you adapt. So I remember so I was in LA over Christmas and I loved the Whimos cuz I live in New York and we don't have them and the first half a dozen times I got out I thanked the Whimo and then I'm like wait I'm just saying thank you to myself and by like the seventh time I just got out of the car right so you you definitely do adapt I think it's nice to be polite to robots. Yeah. I wonder well you can tell me if they appreciate it or not. I think so. I think so. I like to think that. Yeah. And what about the flip side of it? So do you have people saying hey human beings need jobs and and you're putting them out of work? I think that's like human nature. Yeah. Uh, funny enough, most negative reactions I see are online, not in person. People who have seen the robots actually feel fairly positively about them. Um, kids, kids love robots. It's really fun to see their interactions. They sometimes get their parents to pull over and they go, you know, want to see the robot and play with it, get in it way. But, um, there are always going to be, I think, kind of, you know, initial fear and and concerns and some of them are absolutely valid. By the way, I don't I don't question it. But, uh, good news is that in person when you when you see the robot, 99.9% of the time their action is really really positive. And what do you need to get a city to let you do this? Is it legal until they tell you to stop or do you proactively need to create a regulation or a law? Yeah, actually I think this is an area maybe the work you do can help us. But um by default in the US the robots are allowed to operate in cities unless they have put um any restrictions which is actually quite rare. We found a lot of positive momentum with them too because again whether you care about sustainability or your local businesses or safety this really checks a lot of those boxes. Um but unfortunately every now and then there is someone some politician somewhere who wants to you know rally around an idea and and they have done this which is kind of brings brings me to the question I had for you. One of the biggest challenges that I found in our work is actually the political system. Sure. whether it's maybe incompetence or instability or corruption and coronism or for for all these reasons we find ourselves challenged um in in ways that we shouldn't probably be like this shouldn't be the the the the job of the innovators to be fighting these systems right and I'm kind of wondering you you know I would love to actually first hear you know your version of uh your story I I I listen to your talk it's it's fantastic I love what you're working on I grew up in Iran so I've seen the other side of a broken kind of democracy. So, um the work you do, how important it is and how do you think it it can actually help with situations like this where misalignment exists? Yeah. So, I'm going to work backwards. So in terms of the specific what you're talking about um look regulation by definition is always going to lag innovation because until you the innovator think of the idea and then build it and go through all the pain of doing that they don't know that it exists or that or what issues need to be regulated around it. So to a certain extent it's it's kind of the natural order of things but then you get into a problem of regulatory capture where the same people who are supposed to be industries regulated by government end up using government to stop innovation and stop uh new entrance into the marketplace and who that really hurts are consumers right um and so ultimately it really comes down to a question of one what are the reasonable regulations So, for example, when I ran the campaigns to legalize Uber, it was all regulatory capture in the sense that the rules governing how a hired car worked, they already existed, right? We didn't need different rules, right? Um, what the taxi industry tried to do is say, ""Oh, well, if you're using an iPhone to calculate distance or if you're, you know, being called for summoned for a ride this way, that's not okay."" But those were all just attempts to use regulation to drive us out of the market. Once we overcame that, the actual regulatory structure was pretty simple. Fast forward probably eight years later to Bird and to scooters. Um, another sort of very local transportation mobility issue, but um there wasn't a clear set of rules of what you would do with electric scooters. Should they be on the street, on the sidewalk, in bike lanes? Where can they be docked? what should charging be like? Should you need a helmet? Should there be insurance? And those to a certain extent in my view were reasonable questions. So I think part of it is there's always a disconnect to be honest between the innovator who's saying I'm doing something really important and great for society. Get out of my way and the regulator who's saying well it's my job to look after the public good and the safety and everything else. And most of the time no one's actually corrupt. Sometimes they are, but most of the time it's that everyone has their perspective. And like everything in life, they have a hard time understanding the other's perspective. And so there's this cognitive dissonance between the two. A lot of my job is really to try to like basically help them understand like, look guys, you don't really disagree on that much. So let's agree on what we can. Maybe we'll have to fight a little bit of this out. Um, and that's how it works. And so, um, there are definitely solutions to most of it, but the the first question you really asked is kind of basically why am I here at at TEAD? And it's I was lucky to be able to give a talk today on mobile voting. And so, we have been building our own mobile voting technology over the last four years that we're just about done with. By the time this airs, we probably will have already finished it and and made it public. And it's going to be free and open source. Anyone who wants to use it. And my hope is that we can then legalize it and everyone watching this can vote in elections on their phones. If we can get turnout up and that combats all the polarization of the system and moves things to the middle. So I guess this is where where that that that the two concepts kind of connect which is if you can empower that 80%. Yeah. rather than the 10% super polarized either they're you know ideologues or the most angry that actually is going to create more alignment between politicians who obviously care about the voter you know whoever votes and innovators right who are trying to create value but a lot of times are you know uh battling well ironically so innovators have to find product market fit right other so as a venture capitalist list. That's really a big part of what I'm looking for, which is okay, one, do I think this is a good idea? Two, do I think Ali or whoever the founder is is capable of executing? And then three, is the public going to want it, right? And if those three things are true, the company usually succeeds. Right? Ironically, founders have to find much broader product market fit than politicians because only 10% of us vote in primaries, but 100% of us buy stuff, right? And so as a result, if voting turnout went up, almost by definition, it would start to align towards the market um and then once those two things are aligned, it's a lot easier to get to rational choices around how to regulate it. Yeah, that that really excites me. It's very cool. I have a interesting question for you. So please, when you started, what did you think were the challenges and then what did they actually turn out to be? Yeah, that's a great question. So, um, when I started, the biggest challenge then is still what it is today, which is people in power don't like making it easier for others to gain power. And by definition, if we're going to triple or quadruple the size of the electorate, people who know how to win in this current environment are not going to like that. So, um, and the only way we're going to overcome that is with a giant grassroots movement where hopefully millions of people will tell their city council members and their elected officials, I want this thing and we're able to push it through anyway. Um, so that's the one that I think kind of remains a challenge. Um, but ultimately this is really a behavioral economics experiment in many ways, right? There's sort of two things I'm betting on. One, if you put things on people's phones, they're going to do it. I think everything you and I have learned in our career says the answer to that is yes. The second, if you change the inputs, if you change the political incentives, you will change the policy outputs because politicians just want to get reelected and will behave rationally in order to do so. Everything that I've done in my career has also told me yes. And so we're really seeing if those two things are the case. I will say building the technology was really hard and really expensive. Um I've spent about $20 million of my own money on this so far. It's totally philanthropic and you know but for us the view was it's got to be right and even if that means it cost me more money, even if that means it takes longer because I thought we'd be done with this a couple of years ago to be honest. Um, but it's got to be perfect because everyone who doesn't want it. They can't say publicly that they don't want more people to vote. They know that. They have to come up with an excuse, right? So, the excuse can be it's not safe. It can't work. Technically impossible. And if I gave them a product that that it didn't work, I'd be dead in the water. And so we have just been working just iterating forever and testing and everything else to get to a point where we've built a system that we think is incredibly secure and incredibly easy to use uh and will stand up to the critics and we'll have our share of critics for sure. And you mentioned open source. I I'm assuming that's a really important part of it is and one of the reasons that I felt that this needed to be done philanthropically is in order for I think the public to have confidence in the validity of an election done on your phone. And to be clear, it's just meant to be one additional way to vote. It's not replacing voting by mail or person or anything else, but it has to be auditable, has to be verifiable, which means it has to be open source. And my fear was an election company, and they do exist, isn't going to invest eight figures of their own money and then just give away the IP to everybody else, right? And I understand that. I'm in business, too. I get that. Um, but as from a philanthropic standpoint, I was lucky enough that I could afford to do that. And I think the fact that it's open source does generate I I'm even seeing this conference where you have just lots of technically sophisticated people. And the reaction to what I'm doing because it's open source is so much friendlier than I think if it had been just like another guy with another product that he's trying to sell. Excellent. So paint me a vision of the future. Think think ahead. Assume the regulatory stuff is whatever you want it to be just for sake of this argument. And if everything goes perfectly, what do our lives look like? And like in what ways are they better? I am so incredibly optimistic and excited. Good. For a number of reasons. Uh actually I'll start with one. Just being at a place like this talking to folks like yourself. You explained why this project is open source which may not have been possible through a normal for-profit uh effort. But people like yourself exist and I in fact most CEOs that I know are really thoughtful um stewards in this moment. Uh so that's one thing that makes me excited. Of course the other one is the technology itself and we've you know what I like to to say is this AI this large language models. It's a it's not a discovery. It's not an invention. It is a discovery. We've figured out how to put data together in in a way that suddenly this magic happens and it's doing things we didn't even expect. And if you think about it discoveries always have much bigger impacts beyond what we even thought initially. So we've t silicon inter in intelligence which means everything around us is going to have that intelligence. So starting with one of the actually my favorite TED talks of all time was Salmon Khan talking about tutors in every kid's pockets. Y the tutor that the richest person cannot buy is now almost free that any child anywhere in the world can actually right and I don't I don't know if you teach but I I do and um and my students are smart. It's Columbia Business School. And yet despite that everyone has a different learning style, right? and someone learns from reading and someone from writing and someone from listening and someone from doing. And as a teacher, even with really bright kids, you still kind of have to teach to the lowest common denominator, right? And if you could instead use AI to sort of teach things to everyone's individualized learning style, I I just the efficacy of education would be exponentially greater. Yeah. So that's that's education uh in medicine. We listened to a talk today about these rare diseases and existing medication that can actually cure them. But there's like millions of combinations. How are you going to check every single one of them? But guess what? AI is going to make that so much easier. Again, they're scaling intelligence, right? And you can cure I think they said one out of 10 of us are our children are going to experience one of these rare diseases for which there is no medication and the process of coming up with one would be so expensive. So again right right now you don't get solved. Sorry. So, education, healthcare, what else? And I guess uh coming into the physical world. Yeah. Um I have this thesis that we are about to unbundle the car. Okay. So, take it apart into we we basically made this monster of a machine that's by the way getting bigger and more dangerous. Unfortunately, we've started reversing the trend around safety. And if you could have again a a shopping cart size robot do the last mile deliveries, have a drone that does the long longer distance kind of deliveries, have autonomous vehicles for the the appropriate applications for them. Um even scooters the one of the challenges with scooters has been you have to bring them to people at the right time. If if you do there would be more adoption but the scooters can't move by themselves right now. What if they could by by making them autonomous? So I think removing those cars off the road is is one of the biggest most interesting things because the our city is going to change. Imagine how our cities changed when cars were first introduced, right? Like that's the kind of scale of change that I expect to see in cities again for the better. By the way, I'll even just say as a someone who lives in Manhattan in this congestion pricing zone since January 2nd whenever it kicked in, there's a difference, right? And that's a relatively minor change, right? That's just a minor tax policy designed to disincentivize certain amounts of consumer driver behavior at certain times, right? Like that's pretty low level. And yet I experience it and I benefit from it and I see it. So now one thing I've always wondered about is how you kind of the declination between drones and and robots when it comes to delivery, right? And the way I think about it in my head, but I don't know if this is right at all, would be suburban and rural areas, drones make a lot of sense. Highdensity urban areas, drones would be really hard and that's where robots come in. Is that a fair way to think about it? Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Actually, they may even work together. Okay. So, we we're doing this um program pilots actually with uh wing, which is the subs of alphabet. And the idea is drones work great when they they're going longer distances into less populated areas, but a lot of goods originate in highly populated areas like restaurants. Yeah. But drones need some real estate to get to the restaurant. Yes. How do you solve that? How does the drone actually get the food when most restaurants don't have the real estate? Also, you know, drone can have noise. There there other challenges. Well, we actually have a robot pick up the food and hand it over just like a couple blocks away, maybe in an empty parking lot to the drone automatically to the drone and the drone would would actually go completely. These are all very comp. Yeah, it's very cool. It's the only thing cooler than robots is robots and drones, right? Together. Yeah. And I'm actually curious. Yeah. What do you think your system um would have what kind of impact in other countries? We've talked about the US. Yeah. So, um, good news is we want this is anyone's welcome to use this. I'm actually in Estonia and England next month about it. I'm in Israel the following month about it. So, I would be thrilled to see any country adopt this. Like overall, unless there's compulsory voting like Australia, voter turnout is never as good as it should be. So always if you take our underlying agreement that more turnout leads to more democracy, better outcomes, more alignment with the market and everything else, you would see that everywhere. You know that what's really interesting is the most common question I get about robots is about vandalism. Yeah. To the point that I get the question more often than it happens. I could see that. And so what's the real answer? The real answer is it doesn't happen as often as people ask me the question. like robots can complete deliveries at a better reliability rate than actually human career is right now and that that like a small percentage of failure includes vandalism and everything else that could go wrong. Right? So I've always had noticed this this this phenomenal that we have such a low opinion of ourselves for some reason and I don't know where that comes from. Maybe it's Hollywood every apocalyptic movie you know people are behaving the worst possible way. I remember when I first moved to Canada and there was some some issue with the water. So, everybody had to go get water from the store rather than like from the pipes and people were so kind. But when you see that in the movie, right, they're all killing each other. Exactly. I'm like I I don't know where this gap comes from, but we definitely have a lower opinion of ourselves. I would argue social media is the culprit of a lot of this, right? because we have this mechanism that seems to bring out the absolute worst in people and then the regulations are this is a case where there's not nearly in my view enough regulation around innovation because as I understand it human beings have an inherent negativity bias because it's literally what makes us leave the house when we smell gas it's what went back in the old days if we saw a lion you walked in the other direction right like you have to have it to survive five, but then it it manifests itself in lots of different ways. And one of the ways it manifests itself is if you have two two headlines to click on, and there's endless AB testing showing this, you're going to most likely click on the negative headline. And you know who knows that? Mark Zuckerberg. You know who knows that? Elon Musk. You know who knows that Bite Dance. to all of the people that own these platforms, if all of the money they make is basically just based on clicks, which is 99% of their business models, then they are perversially incentivized to push the most toxic content towards people. And so we are seeing the worst stuff. And so if you think about it, many ways social media is almost the unhappiness machine because it does two things. One, it shows you how your real life is inadequate compared to everyone else's fake life. So you feel bad about yourself. Two, everything bad happening everywhere in the world is thrown at you at once. So your life seems inadequate and the world seems terrible. And so of course you develop these sort of negative sentiments and views about humanity and everything else. And so I would argue this is a case where you could have regulation. This may be getting too granular, but do you know what section 230 is? Right. So for the for the viewers and listeners um in 1996, Congress passed a law called the Communications Decency Act and they had a provision in there called section 230 that said that internet platforms are not liable for the content posted by its users. And in 1996 that made a lot of sense, right? Because the internet was just barely happening and it needed to get off the ground. But what they couldn't have envisioned back then was social media and all these other things and they never updated the law. And as a result, the same responsibilities that a normal media company has to meet where, you know, if they were to defame you in some way, you could sue them, right? Or even that among individuals, we have, you know, legal obligations. They don't have any at all. So you're saying to these companies, you can make as much more money by showing people toxic stuff and they can't sue you. You can't get in trouble for it. Like what do you expect them to do, right? And by the way, to just bring this back to mobile voting right now, it's not that politicians don't understand that they need to repeal section 230. In fact, in the 2020 election, ironically, Trump and Biden both had it in their platforms. The problem is in a world of 10% turnout in congressional races, the meta lobbyists walk around the halls of the capital and say, ""Hey, you know, section 230, I heard you might be for repealing it. be a real shame if someone ran against you next time and had a $5 million check from us and everyone's like, ""Well, I don't want to lose my election, so I won't do it."" Um, and as a result, it prevents change. And that, you know, is not just sort of this negative sentiment, but we see, you know, massive rise in self harm, massive rise in cyber bullying, massive rise in teenage suicide, like all these really terrible outcomes. And so it all gets back to like we need a government that is working in the interests of people and what people want is to be heard. What people want is to be able to get things done and find reasonable compromises and they want to be able to take advantage of technologies and ideas that will make their lives easier and better and more fun. Um and fundamentally that's what we should be working towards in my view. Empowering the 80% like we keep coming back to that. Yes. like getting them to actually be the reason why politicians do things, not the not the extreme ends. So I guess what makes you optimistic? We've talked about a lot of problems. Yeah. But like what are you looking for? Well, I I think a few things. I think one is I do believe in the underlying nature of people. Two, I believe in the underlying nature of technology to make people's lives better. And so while I do believe for example that we do need regulation to deal with certain negative manifestations of AI surveillance for example um the drug development the you know one thing we didn't talk about yet would be energy right like the way to me that you solve the climate crisis is AI figuring out carbon capture right um education so there are so many ways that technology can make our lives better I think the inherent nature of people and then you know I go to a conference like TED had and it's hard not to be inspired by it because all of the speakers and by the way not just the speakers just anyone even randomly I've like sat down next to someone and we've struck up a conversation you have all these really smart people and I think the same thing applies for people watching this and who are just engaged in the TED content who want to make the world better are working on specific tangible ideas to make the world better dedicating their money their lives their resources their reputations to making it better and I think those people ultimately only win. Agreed. We have a incredible system of experimentation in place for those people that are trying absolutely everything under the sun to to find all these interesting ways. Like our idea of robots was not very popular when we first started, but now you know you're getting to see the results and it's getting more popular. I'm sure you know you you probably felt that way at the beginning of oh voting on your phone and then everybody's complaining about these voting machines and like you know but the fact that all these people are out there trying different things and and you know eventually some of these ideas actually work and and and can have such material impact. All right, thank you. Thank you so much.",unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mhLWUjB2ox4,"When you pick a piece of fruit off a tree, it's like a ticking time bomb. It's literally this living
and breathing thing that's slowly cannibalizing
its own stores of energy and nutrients, just trying to stay alive until it ultimately gets eaten by microbes or some other animal, like us. Have you ever wondered why that is and what could be done about it? My journey in trying to figure that out started in the spring of 2013. I'm finishing up my postdoctoral
research in chemistry at the University
of Santa Barbara, California. And all that really means
is I’m a huge nerd and I've been in school for way too long. And I'm trying to figure out how to put
all that training to meaningful use. So two of my lab mates,
James Rogers and Louis Perez, invite me to dinner. But it turns out to be a pitch
disguised as dinner, and they opened by totally flooring me
with some staggering stats. A third of the food
that we produce worldwide is lost or wasted before it ever
has a chance to be eaten. For fresh fruits and vegetables, that number is a half. And waste is a problem
at every single step of the supply chain. From the farm, trying to get it to market, in stores, restaurants and in our homes. And it's not just a waste of the food. It's a waste of the land, water, fertilizers, labor, energy, fuel, packaging and money out of farmers' and our pockets. If global food waste was a country, it'd be the third-highest emitter
of greenhouse gases after China and the US. For decades, all around the world, we've relied heavily on a surprisingly
small number of ways to help fruits and vegetables
last longer after harvest. These have gotten us a really long way, but they also have their challenges. Refrigeration is a massive energy suck, a significant source of emissions, and it's expensive. It's unfortunately why
a lot of places around the world don't have access to refrigeration. Designer pesticides aren't great for our long-term health
or the environment. Waxes, some can be plant-based, but a lot of them are also
animal-derived or petroleum-derived, and they help make produce look better but not really meaningfully extend
their life and quality. And packaging, that's just adding to our problems with single-use plastics
and microplastics. And then all of this leads to a pretty narrow set
of fruits and vegetables that are available in stores today relative to the amazing diversity
of what's really out there. And so it's really like the categories that can survive storage
and transportation that are commonly available. And those aren't always
the ones that taste best or have the highest density of nutrients. So my friends wanted
to approach this differently. And we led first with some questions. How do plants protect themselves? Well, with a peel. Plants, just like us,
have a skin or a peel, technically called the plant cuticle, and that helps to protect them
from moisture loss, oxidation and infection. And what are those peels made of? Fatty acids, glycerides. That's what's the important part. And these are ingredients
found universally in all plants. In the peel, pulp and seeds, and including in plants
that we already eat. Different fruits have
different shelf lives because of the thickness and arrangement
of these materials in those peels. So the idea then is: Can we take these harmless,
edible, plant-based ingredients, apply them in a thin layer on the surface of fresh
fruits and vegetables to help reinforce
the existing natural peel? And if you do that, can you help to retain peak flavor,
texture and nutrients for longer without reliance on refrigeration, pesticides, waxes or plastics? And so that's what James, Lou and I, that's why we founded Apeel Sciences and ultimately headed to James's garage
to try and figure out. We started first by partnering
with a small local grower, and we tested the idea on this category
you may not have heard of called finger limes. They are literally finger-shaped,
and when you cut them open, the pulp is in the shape
of beads, like caviar. They are delicious,
and they’re super fragrant. But once they’re picked, that grower had maybe about seven days before their organic limes
would start to dry out and the skin would start to change color. And that was even with refrigeration. So we took a test batch
of material that we made using leftover tomato peels, since those are rich
in these fatty acids and glycerides. We dipped those limes in a bowl
of these ingredients in water and set them aside to dry. And then we waited. And we saw that we could add an extra week
of freshness to these limes. And when we saw that for the first time, we were like, ""Shut the front door! Oh my God, this might actually work."" So we then went and wanted to apply
this little bit of extra peel to all other kinds of fruits
and vegetables. Bananas, avocados, limes, green beans, tomatoes, bell peppers, cucumbers, berries, like, you name it. And what we saw, amazed
and quite frankly, still amazes us. This concept works
for dozens of categories, things that need to ripen
before you eat them, things that don't. Things that have edible peels, non-edible peels. We even saw
that with protected blueberries, we could retain vitamin C levels
at higher levels for longer than unprotected blueberries. And tomatoes could be harvested later, not when they were green and tasteless, but when they were red and actually ripe, and they'd still have enough time
to get into your homes. And we love that it really
takes so little material, the little bit of extra peel we add
to an average avocado, for example, that's equivalent in weight
to a 10th of a small raisin. And even though these materials are,
of course, they're edible, you can wash them off
by just rubbing under running water. We also, the more that we learned about the fresh produce
supply chain today, we realized we could integrate
into how these are processed in these packing houses
before they're sent to grocery stores. So thinking about replacing
a standard waxing step, for example. We've made good progress
since those early days in the garage. We've established a supply chain
for responsibly sourced, high-purity ingredients. We've demonstrated safety
and effectiveness to regulators in the US, the European Union and more than 40 additional
countries around the world. And while we're still relatively
small and early in our journey, we have a presence
in about 10 markets worldwide. What I'm most proud of, though, it's why we got into all
of this in the first place. And that is that since 2021,
when we started measuring, we've prevented 166 million pieces
of produce from going to waste. In doing that, that's avoided the emissions
of more than 29,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions, which is equivalent
to planting 485,000 trees and saved almost seven
billion liters of water, or enough to fill 2,800
Olympic-sized swimming pools. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) What we're also excited about is the opportunity
to add a little extra peel to help small growers get their unique varieties of fruits
and vegetables to market with more confidence. This is especially important
in places that don't have widespread or reliable access to refrigeration, like with these regional mango varieties. This could mean that a greater
diversity of fruits and vegetables could be more available to more people. The work, though, is far from done. We've unfortunately encountered
food and agriculture companies that have a really hard time seeing past
the food waste status quo. ""Shrink,"" as it's called in the industry, it's just accepted
as a normal part of doing business. And disappointingly,
we’ve had some folks -- producers, packers
and retailers -- tell us, ""Well, the waste bin
is kind of my best friend. The more that people throw away, the more they have
to come back and buy again."" So let's just say
that's not what we expected when we first approached them to talk about extending the life and quality of fresh products. But we can't change this thinking alone. And we're not a silver bullet
to end food waste ourselves. But thankfully there are lots
of start-ups, scale-ups, organizations and individuals all around the world working to transform
this post-harvest space. And we're optimistic
that our one small innovation, using common ingredients inspired by the ancient wisdom of plants, is playing its part and having an impact, reinventing the food system and helping to create abundance for all. Thanks so much. (Applause) Thank you. Latif Nasser: Incredible,
thank you, Jenny. I feel like, when I buy avocados and then I bring them home, and then I blink and they are rotten. How long could you extend
the shelf life of an avocado? Jenny Du: In your experience,
maybe you have this, too, there's like a day, a day and a half when they're like, perfect. Like, avocado toast, cuttable,
before you’re like, do I sacrifice them to guacamole? And so it takes that day and a half
and extend it to four days. Maybe you're actually going
to have a chance to use it before you throw it away. LN: So you're more than doubling. And when you're spraying
things that don't have a shell, does it have a taste
or a smell or anything? JD: No, they're very neutral. So no taste, no smell. You saw we used a little of it. It's like a strange thing
we do around the office, which is like, eat the fruit,
lick the surface, like, confirm that. But we've also done it with
credible other institutions, like universities doing these blind
taste tests with strawberries. And you can't tell
that there's anything on them. LN: Amazing. Jenny Du, everybody. Thank you so much, Jenny.

EGM-b1bhqkY,"Everyone talks about building
a better world. But let me tell you, without a business model
designed to get us there, it's just wishful thinking. In the private sector, we've seen retreat: DEI diluted, ESG scaled back, brands that were once bold
are afraid of being called woke. It was like a purpose gold rush. They all rushed in,
dug around for a bit, thought it was hard. And they're moving on. And I say stop! Your business models are failing you. Your business models are failing
society, and they’re failing us. And you know what? And just as the private
sector is retreating, aid is disappearing. Progress on everything,
from women's health, climate change, education, isn't just stalling, it's reversing. Yet the needs have not shrunk. They have grown deeper,
louder, more urgent. Now the key question is: How are we going to reduce the gap between what is really needed
and what's being done? The answer isn't more philanthropy. And it isn't finger pointing. We need to fix business models. And the way we will fix
business models is together. Because we need to create
a new kind of value for people, planet and profit. And this is what I came
to speak to you about. I've been working
at this space for decades. At the intersection of public health
and global brands. I'm an author, a long-time campaigner
on ethical business. And you know what excites me the most? It's when I get companies
to dream up their mission in a way that they can help
solve a global problem. Whilst being great for the business. And let me show you how that's worked. So first, I never expected
to be working in a corporation trying to solve a global problem. I grew up at a dinner table where the main course served was justice. This is me with my parents. Economy students that ended up
living their ideals, became aid workers. Me and my younger siblings
were raised between refugee camps and UN report briefings. And every night was a lesson
in inequality and possibility. This is us living in rural Mali,
next to Timbuktu. And it is in places like this that I grew my conviction that I wanted to make a difference
for the most vulnerable in this world. Years later, when I went on to do
my doctorate in public health, I came across a staggering fact. Over one million people could be saved by something as simple
as handwashing with soap. And mostly children under five, not dissimilar from the age
of my siblings in this picture. And yet, only one person in five
washed their hands after the toilet. Oh, well. And a massive opportunity
for a bar of soap. So fueled with all this conviction
and this desire to save lives, I joined the world's largest
soap manufacturer, Unilever. In countries like India and Bangladesh, where child mortality was obscenely high, soap was already in eight
out of 10 households. And the iconic bar of soap, red Lifebuoy, was in the market leaders. So what was the problem? The technology was there. Obviously, the challenge
was behavior change at scale. Because soap on shelves
doesn’t save lives. Behavior change does. So we reimagined our business
model around three things. We committed for the long haul because behavior change
takes time, trust and trial. Two, we put the impact need
at the core of our business model. Lifebuoy’s mission
became help a child reach five. And that single focus enabled us
to think about product innovation, marketing and market
expansion very differently. Three, we embraced radical collaborations, collaborations with government, foundations, NGOs, even our competitors. We didn't just attract partners, we built believers. And you know what happened? Well, this -- we co-created the largest hygiene program in the world. We changed the behavior
of one billion people. Let me repeat that. One billion people. (Applause) That's the equivalent
of one in seven people. And Lifebuoy did become
a one-billion-dollar brand. Proof that what's good for society
can be great for business. I spent 15 years of my career
working on Lifebuoy. And this is what I've learned. Through persistence, failures and belief. Real impact does not happen overnight. It never happens alone. And when you create value
for both business and society, that's when real change happens. And any one of us can do the same. Which may sound impossible,
but in this playbook of not overnight, never alone, creating value
in business and society, we have the playbook for success. I can already hear you say,
""Well, that's easy. It's a soap bar. How difficult can that be? Low risk, benign functional product."" But our playbook applies to any business. Now let me take you to South Africa, where one in three women
face gender-based violence. Where most murders are committed
by an intimate partner. An unlikely ally? A beer brand? Well, Carling Black Label,
long trusted by men, used that influence
to confront toxic masculinity. Since 2017, they've been driving
their #NoExcuse campaign and workshops in townships
with grassroots organizations and redefining what manhood should be: strength through respect. Teaching men how to drink smartly. And the results of that, 40 percent of men publicly standing up
against gender-based violence and more brand love from women and men. Now we have not solved
gender-based violence. Let's just get that straight. But we've seen what can be done when unlikely allies do step up. And when brands do align
with their consumer to try to shift something
and change norms. Real things just change. Change happens right there and then because you're not just selling a product. Our playbook has worked across the world, and here's something else
that we've learned in the process. A mission isn't what one brand
can and should do alone. A mission is what none of us can do alone. Let me now introduce you to someone
very brave and close to my heart. Her name is Fatima. She's 15, smart, brave, curious. She's a voice. And she's built through
a radical collaboration between local partners and AI. She represents millions of girls. Girls who miss school every month
because of their periods. Girls who navigate and hide in shame and stigma and sometimes violence. Girls, who in the most desperate moment
will trade sex for pads. Yes, it happens. And yes, it's preventable. Now we've gathered hundreds of stories
across Africa in their own languages, and soon the world. And what Fatima does
is that she synthesizes their voice, not to speak for them,
but to speak with them and tell us what they want, which is mental health support, contraceptive access in dignity, creative freedom, leadership skills, safe places to dream and grow and learn. Now these stories are not just emotional, they're systemic. I always say that everything I've learned about building a mission-driven economy, I have learned from sex, soap and alcohol. (Laughter) (Applause) You know, strange bedfellows, yes. But they're at the front
lines of inequality, culture and transformation. And they've taught me that when you deal with what's hard
and you do it ethically, then brands can be a powerful engine
for dignity and change. Now we have a chance to create
the world we want to live in. A world where business
doesn't perform just for optics. We don't need to have many,
many, many more chief marketing officers. But what I need is for each one of you to unleash this inner
chief mission officer. You know that person who's obsessed about driving positive impact
for billions of people. Because that's within reach. But you can't do this overnight. Not alone. And by creating value
for business and society, that's when we go from mission impossible to mission possible. Thank you very much.

iSUZjXiGHpQ,"Alright, so -- Get a degree, get a job, build your future. No matter where you're from, it's like page one
of the universal parenting handbook. And if you grew up
with parents anything like mine, you knew it was one of those,
you know, just casual, non-negotiable suggestions
that they had for you. (Laughter) But no matter what our parents might say,
it's a path that for so many, just doesn't hold up. Not here in Kenya, not across the world. Every month, more than a million
young people enter the workforce across Sub-Saharan Africa. Fewer than one in four
will get access to a formal job. And at first glance,
it looks a lot like a crisis, right? Like this jobless generation. Honestly, I used to see it that way too. I'm a third generation East African. I've always believed in the power
of business and technology to fuel development. For the longest time,
I thought that meant one thing: helping to create formal jobs. But after more than a decade of working
with young people here in Kenya, I started to see something
very different, right? People like Kelvin running his cyber cafe. Or Melissa, with her hair salon. Or Mercy, with her auto repair shop. And the thing is, they are not outliers. They are part of this powerful engine. Millions of young people contributing
over 540 million dollars a month into Kenya's economy. The informal economy is an engine
that is already turning. It’s how 85 percent of people
across Sub-Saharan Africa and 60 percent of the global
workforce earn an income. So a few years ago,
a couple of colleagues and I decided to take a step back,
ask ourselves a different question, not, how do we pull people out
of the informal economy, but what if we invested in it and helped it grow
more efficiently and at scale. And that’s what led us
to build MESH in 2021. It's this platform to help
this hustle economy grow. It's a professional
social network where today, more than 800,000 micro entrepreneurs come to connect and learn and trade and access a marketplace
of opportunities each month. And the thing is, as we built MESH, we started to see these patterns
and behaviors start to emerge that often challenged some
of our long-held assumptions, but also revealed some of the levers that really drive growth
in the informal economy. And so I wanted to take this opportunity
to share three of our big lessons with you today, because if we're serious
about building a sustainable future, we can't ignore the billions
navigating the informal sector. So our first, and honestly,
possibly coolest, lesson that we've learned is that the most powerful lever
for income growth in the informal economy is identity. See, young people have been told
an incredibly unhelpful story for most of their life: That success means getting a formal job. And when that path doesn't open up,
it can be paralyzing. But when identity shifts, behavior shifts. So when they stop seeing
themselves as unemployed or jobless and actually as entrepreneurs, things change and pretty quickly. So, take Brian. Brian studied to be a teacher, but he spent years bouncing between gigs, and he will be the first to tell you he never saw himself
as someone who could run a business. One day he was chatting with a connection
he made on the platform, a woman named Eunice. At some point she said,
""Honestly, Brian, just why not business?"" Something eventually just clicked for him. He said, ""I started admiring her business. I thought maybe I could do that too."" And so he did. He started small,
selling fruit, then donuts, then he moved into charcoal. Today, Brian is running
three small businesses and he's saving up
for his own permanent stall. And Brian wasn't alone. When we started
measuring this more closely, we were blown away by just how powerful this shift
in identity could actually be. Seventy-eight percent of our
MESH members were telling us that they had either started
a brand new business, or improved by adding to an existing one, often within just a couple of months
of signing up for the platform. And amongst that group, the number earning more than national
minimum wage more than doubled. So when I see myself differently,
I act differently. And when that happens amongst our peers,
that change can often be contagious. So our second big lesson was really about the importance
of designing for the real world. And the best example of that that I have
is how we approach skills development. So most programs aimed
at the informal economy assume that growth
looks a lot like a ladder, right? You, you know, study hard, get a certificate,
use that to get the job, to build credentials,
to move up step by step. And so the learning systems
are all designed to match this, right? You know, longer courses, modules, quizzes,
formal learning pathways. That's how we approached it too. The problem is, that's not how growth
really happens in the informal economy. Growth here is often entirely non-linear. It's characterized
by rapidly shifting needs or new opportunities
that you need to jump on. It looks a lot less like a ladder, and it looks a lot more like a jungle gym. My favorite example of this is Caroline. Caroline graduated with a degree
in analytical chemistry, but she could not find a job. She started a business selling clothes,
saved up some money, and fashion wasn't her thing. But she spotted a new opportunity
that she really loved, hair. And so she invested
in a one-month wig making class and she just ran with it. She built a business. She picked up pricing tips
from other MESHers. She learned digital marketing skills
to build and grow her online sales. When she needed to,
she picked up basic bookkeeping to help her manage her cash flow. Today, Caroline's
a full-time entrepreneur, but she didn't climb a ladder. She moved across this jungle gym, one business and one pivot at a time. And all along the way, she invested in the skills she needed
to keep her growing. And we saw this happening
all across the platform. Young people were not engaging
with our formal learning tools, but their incomes were growing. So 66 percent of our MESHers tell us
that they have learned a new skill, which has improved
their business on the platform, but not from a course, often from a peer. Another micro entrepreneur,
just two steps ahead, just sharing what they'd figured out. And the learning itself,
it's so practical, it's so immediate. It's like a 90-second video
on how to price your sandals, or a group chat on how
to save water in your agribusiness. One of our favorites, ""Why bad loans
are a lot like bad boyfriends and how to spot the red flags."" (Laughter) It is learning that just
mirrors real life. So our third lesson is a pretty
fundamental one. It's about trust. In the informal economy, there are no contracts
or insurance policies or formal protections. If a deal goes wrong, it's on you. Take Alfine. Alfine trained to be a photographer. She saved up painstakingly
to get her first camera. And one day a client reached out. They paid a deposit, it seemed legitimate. She showed up for the shoot, and within minutes, her gear was stolen. It set her back, she was set up,
and she had to start all over again. And this is why a lot
of micro entrepreneurs, they choose to play it safe. They stick to trusted circles. And when we asked our MESH members, ""How do you know
who you can actually trust?"" The word that we hear
most often is ""serious."" ""I look for serious people."" ""I knew he was a serious guy."" It's shorthand, right? For someone reliable,
for someone who shows up. But we wanted to understand
that a little bit better. So we ran an experiment. It was really simple. We brought 30 micro
entrepreneurs into a room. No profiles, no CVs. Everyone got a blank poster and a marker just to describe who they were
in their own words. And then everyone got five post-it notes to put on the profiles of the individuals
that they would most like to work with, and to tell us why. And consistently, the most sought-after profiles weren't the ones
with the highest education or the most established businesses. They were the ones who wrote
about helping others, mentoring peers,
supporting their communities, the ones with social capital. Because in the informal sector, trust and reliability
aren't about what you have, they're about what you
contribute, seriously. And that kind of social capital is what makes the informal
sector function, right? It's how you know who you can work with, lend to, buy from. The problem is, it isn't really bankable
beyond your immediate circle, and unfortunately,
least of all at the bank itself. But that is a massive opportunity. Because when young people
are able to build visible, trusted identities online that showcase all the ways
that they show up, it unlocks a whole new world
of peer-to-peer trade. And a massive opportunity
for the formal world, right? So for lenders, for corporates, for organizations that are looking
to assess trustworthiness, if we lean into these models, all of a sudden we can begin
to lend with more confidence, or find talent, or offer gigs in ways that just
have not been possible before. So in the informal economy, what we're seeing is that this
is absolutely working, right? Today, when we do surveys, markets are expanding on MESH. Forty-nine percent of our audience are telling us that they have now
begun to work with and earn from other MESH members
on the platform. And what we're seeing
isn't just a way to facilitate trade or establish trust in the informal sector. It's a glimpse into how
more resilient economies could work. Because when we think about a world
facing climate constraints or rising inequalities, economies that reward
this type of contribution, rather than just consumption might be one of the most
sustainable shifts that we can actually make. Look, honestly, we've learned
a ton over the last five years. The most important lesson is this. The informal economy
is not a problem to be solved. It is this phenomenally
powerful engine to be supported. And I'm not saying jobs don't matter. Of course they do, right? But the road to those jobs and to broader economic growth might just run through
the informal economy first. And what we’re seeing goes beyond MESH. So from digital lenders experimenting with social
and behavioral data, to renewable-energy companies leveraging community distribution models
to expand their reach and sales. When we design for the informal economy, we unlock massive new possibilities. And whether that is growing new markets or expanding livelihoods, or even accelerating climate action, this generation and the economy
that they power are central to all of it. So the solutions that we build
have to work for them here and now. And so the real opportunity here
isn't to fix the informal economy. It's to fuel it. Thank you. (Applause)",unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whaesnYloMQ,"I am here to talk about parenting, which is kind of weird because
if you Google ""America's worst mom,"" you find me there for 22 Google pages, followed by ""America's Worst
Mother's Day gift,"" which, guys -- a lot of you here -- we don't want an iron
and lingerie's for Father's Day. So -- (Laughter) How do you get a name like that? Well, years ago,
when our younger son was nine, he started asking me and my husband if we would take him
someplace he'd never been before in New York City, where we live, and let him find
his own way home by subway. So we talked about it, me and my husband, who you never hear of
as ""America's worst dad."" Hmm. (Laughter) And we decided, sure. Long story short,
I wrote a newspaper column, ""Why I let my nine-year-old
ride the subway alone,"" and two days later,
I was on the ""Today Show,"" MSNBC, Fox News and NPR. Fox News and NPR. OK? Kind of wild. (Laughter) And I realize that a lot of you would not
make the same decision, obviously. But you should have seen our son. He came into the apartment levitating. He was so happy. So I want you to think back
for just a second on something that you
absolutely loved doing as a kid. Maybe flashlight tag, building forts. And now I want you to raise your hand if your mom knew exactly where you were. OK. It's an older crowd here. (Laughter) It is usually the younger people
who raise their hands because that's what's changed. In fact, that's what I wrote
my book about, ""Free-Range Kids."" For the last generation or two, kids have been getting
so little time on their own, so little time unsupervised. And of course, some of that's good.
Togetherness is good. Kids need a strong bond. But, you know, too much
is driving us all crazy. There was the Surgeon General
report from 2021, which a lot of you probably saw. It said that kids are more depressed
and anxious than ever. Right? And then he came out with a report
like two years later that said parents are more depressed
and anxious than ever. I'm like, yeah, because
we need our space, right? The olden days were not perfect, but back then there were three worlds
that were absolutely, perfectly balanced. There was the kid world
filled with, you know, bikes and adventures and playing, and the adult world -- so boring. People were always talking about politics
and who was having a procedure. And a lot of polyps, polyps, polyps. And then there was -- (Laughter) Then there was family world
when everyone was together, like on vacation or at dinner. But now they've all been
sort of mashed up together, and especially since phones, because now, even when parents
aren't physically with their kids, they can be texting and talking
and tracking them. So the worlds are not in balance anymore. Fortunately, the reason I'm here, is that there is a sort of easy way to start teasing the worlds apart again, and it just begins
with a little bit of deprogramming. So here goes. We have to realize
that we've been sort of brainwashed into believing that anytime
our kids aren't with us, they're in terrible danger
of being kidnapped by a guy in a white van looking for his puppy. Or -- also tragic --
not getting into Harvard. And as a result -- (Laughter) Terrible. I don't even like
to think about it. (Laughter) But the upshot is that we are spending
way more time with our kids than our parents spent with us, usually helping them do things
that they could do on their own. And the -- I call it the adult takeover of childhood because it's so vast that the University of Michigan
did a study two years ago, and they found that parents
want to give their kids independence, they recognize its importance. But the majority of parents of kids
age 9 to 11, which is tweens, right, kind of old, will not let them play
at the park with a friend, will not let them
walk to a friend's house. And if they're at the store,
shopping together, only 50 percent will let their kid
go to another aisle. That's a real statistic.
That's University of Michigan. So sending your kid for a can of peas
is like sending them to Nam. OK? (Laughter) It's just crazy.
We've got to get braver than that. We got to get brave enough
to send our kids to the canned food aisle or to the park before their voice changes. So how? (Laughter) Well, I've got two
helpful facts and three solutions. Helpful fact one is this: your kid is not going to be kidnapped. OK? If for some reason you wanted them to be snatched
off the street by a stranger, statistically, how long would you
have to keep them outside? 750,000 years. OK? It's a while. And after the first 100,000,
they're not even kids anymore, right? They're not even cute. They're like dust. (Laughter) Fact two is that
when our kids aren't with us and all our teachable moments, they're actually learning more. And let me explain. When adults organize a game,
we are efficient, right? We decide what they're going to play
and whether the ball was in or out, and who gets a trophy,
which is easy because everyone, right? (Laughter) But when kids are organizing a game,
it is a total mess. Especially if you got, like,
a bunch of kids of different ages, like the “Peanuts” gang, well, they have to decide
what they're going to play, and then they have to make the teams
kind of even -- lot of negotiating. And then you have to keep the game going, even when there are arguments,
which there will be. So along the way, they're learning
how to make something happen, how to get buy-in, executive function,
focus, compromise, you know, communication, just all the skills they need
to be a functioning human being. And if a 12-year-old
ends up pitching to a five-year-old, which would never, ever happen
in adult organized sports, well, there's no glory
in striking out a kindergartener, right? So the older kid
throws the ball kind of gently, and the little kid taps it, and the older one goes,
""My God, it's a home run!"" And the little kid is so ecstatic, right? But the older one is too,
because he's doing something new. He is learning how to empathize and how to be generous, how to be an adult. And that's the most
teachable moment of all. When we take those experiences
out of our kids' lives by always being with them
to help them and high-five them, ""good job, good buddy,"" they get anxious because
they don't see how much they can do, how much they can handle on their own. And we get anxious
because we don't see it either. And so we're all feeling
way more anxious than we have to. What can we do? Here's the deal. About eight years ago, the social psychologist Jonathan Haidt and I and two others got together, and we started a nonprofit to make it easy, normal and legal for parents to let go and let grow. OK? In fact, we call
our organization Let Grow. And because a collective problem, which is nobody
letting their kids do anything, needs a collective solution,
everybody doing it at the same time so you don't feel guilty or weird
or judged, God forbid, judged, we came up with two school programs that are free and one new law. The law is this. The law says that it is not illegal to let your kid play
at the park with a friend, or walk to the store,
do all sorts of things on their own. We call it the Reasonable
Childhood Independence law, and so far as of last month,
it has been passed in nine states. (Applause) Yes, right. Thank you. It's a great law. And actually they're voting on it
in Florida tomorrow. And then our two
school programs are these. We would like schools
to stay open after school, not just for chess
and homework help and soccer and all these adult-run activities, but for actual mixed age,
no-devices free play. You put out some balls,
some chalk, cardboard boxes, and there is an adult there
crouching in the corner with an EpiPen. (Laughter) But they don't solve the arguments. They don't organize the game. They're like a lifeguard, OK? And I know everyone thinks
that kids just want to run home. They really want to be with their phones. They really want to be with each other. They really want to be having fun,
playing, having adventures, maybe flirting. And if the only place they can do that
without constant adult supervision is on their phones, of course, that's where they go. But if you give them back a place
that's free of phones, filled with kids a swath of time, they love it. I've gone to these play clubs.
It is so great. I consider them a wildlife sanctuary -- (Laughter) for childhood, right? (Applause) Simple. Just keep
the schools open for free play. Right? The second thing we suggest is that schools do
the Let Grow experience. And that's when teachers give kids
the homework assignment that says, ""Go home and do something new
on your own with your parents' permission, but without your parents. You can climb a tree, walk the dog, make pancakes, doesn't matter, anything. Depending on your age
and your neighborhood, etc."" And it's in just over
a thousand schools so far. And last year we heard of one kid
who was 10 or 11, and he decided for his Let Grow experience
he would make dinner for his family. So he went to get
the ingredients at the store, and he's shopping
and he's getting everything. And then he can't find the hot sauce. And the idea of asking a clerk for help, going up to an adult
like a moron, an idiot -- He just felt so tiny. He couldn't do it.
He ran out of the store. He literally left his cart
and all the other groceries there, and he bolted. And then ... he went back in and he talked to the clerk,
and he got the hot sauce. And in one sense,
it's just a simple errand. Right? But in another sense, it's the hero's journey, right? Because he had been defeated
and humiliated. He actually abandoned his quest, just like they say
in those hero's journeys books. But then he went back in ... and he did it himself. “I did it myself” are childhood’s magic words. ""I did it myself""
is the original anxiety buster. And in fact, if I asked you right now --
and probably we'll talk about it later -- to remember something
that made you really proud of your own kid or your grandkid, or your niece
or your student or nephew, whatever, it's usually something like, you know,
he was on an overnight last night, and the other mom called to say
he cleared the table. Really? Or we were on vacation and she got lost, but she found her own way
back to the hotel. Or my kid took the cousins out last night and let the five-year-old get a home run. We're most proud of our kids
when they do something on their own, and our kids are most proud of themselves
when they do something on their own. So the solution
to the parent anxiety crisis and the kid anxiety crisis turns out to be the exact same thing. You got to pull apart those worlds again. You got to put the kid world
separate from the parent world. Put them back in balance. You got to let kids do something
on their own in the big wide world, maybe without even tracking them
or talking to them or texting them, just trusting them
to do something on their own. And if you can do that, if you can let go, I can guarantee your kids
are going to end up less anxious. Your kids are going to end up smarter. And your kids are going
to feel really proud, but not as proud as you. Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.",unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LAjACL6-Yd4,"And I'm starting to get really nervous because for a long time no one says anything. It's just completely silent. And then one of the professors starts to speak and he says, ""Your work gives me a feeling of joy."" Joy? I wanted to be a designer because I wanted to solve real problems. Joy is nice, I guess, but it's kind of light, not substantial. I asked the professors, ""How do things make us feel joy? How do tangible things make us feel intangible joy?"" They hemmed and hawed and gestured a lot with their hands. ""They just do,"" they said. And this launched a journey, one that I didn't know at the time, would take me 10 years to understand the relationship between the physical world and the mysterious quicksotic emotion we call joy. Hi, I'm Ingred Fatelli. I am a designer and a researcher who studies the relationship between our emotions and our surroundings. I am the author of a book called Joyful and I wrote a blog called The Aesthetics of Joy. Ingred, so let's get started with something that you actually mentioned right before we started this interview. You said I'm not like 100% in the joyful headsp space. It might take me a minute to get back into it. >> Well, it's funny. So, I was talking about how I am researching something new and it's very heady. I'm very in my mind. And I think one of the things that always brings me back to joy is getting back into my body somehow. In this case, like it literally for me was putting on like a colorful, you know, something brightly colored, going for a quick walk or, you know, jumping like doing a few jumps in the air like a kid would do. Um, or spinning around like some physical movement I think often helps to get me out of that rumination headsp space or your, you know, worrying or thinking over problems and back into um, you know, your joyful body. Something that Aesthetics of Joy, the the blog that you wrote and continue to write, has made me think a lot about is the way in which these things like putting on a a colorful piece of clothing or like having polka dots in your house that there are these ways that we can kind of like structurally put more joy into our lives. And I had never thought about it that way before I started reading your work. >> You know, as a kid growing up, I always thought of joy as this thing that you stumble upon, you know, if you get lucky. um you get a few moments of joy in a day, but you never really know where they're going to come from. Um and it wasn't until I became a designer where I was actually, you know, learning to create things something out of nothing, right? You know, you have an idea and you actually literally turn it into physical matter. Um that I started to think about could we actually create things that give this feeling of joy? And if we could, wouldn't that be amazing? because it would take some of the pressure off having to do it for ourselves. If we can put more of it on our surroundings, then you know we have chances we have these repeatable chances to experience joy in our daily lives. >> Before we go too much further, I think maybe we should just go back to square one and say what is joy? >> We often use the words joy and happiness interchangeably. There are so many words in our culture that we use for positive emotions. Um, and yet they kind of all get mixed up. And I think it's for me it's most helpful to define joy in relationship to happiness because those are the two that I think get most uh conflated. So when psychologists use the word joy, what they generally mean is an intense momentary experience of positive emotion. And this is something that we can measure through direct physical expressions. things like smiling and laughter, feeling of wanting to jump up and down. You know, you watch a kid and if they're in a moment of joy, you know, um because they don't mask it, they don't hide it. It's this very um physical visceral feeling. I think this is a really powerful distinction because we spend a lot of our time pursuing happiness, you know, trying to figure out what is the precise combination of things to put into place in our lives that's going to create that perfect state of happiness, that kind of happily ever after from the fairy tales. And yet these little moments of joy are happening all the time. They're always available to us. And when we start to gather them up, lots of positive changes start to happen in our lives. >> Little kids are so full of joy and it's very natural. You are very much an adult and you are a joyful adult. So can you talk about like how you bring joy in to the phase of life that you're in? I love that you brought this up because I think this is such a deep cultural bias that we have, right? That joy is for children um or we associate it with childhood and therefore it must be juvenile. The idea that we can retain joy as we age, it often isn't modeled for us, right? I think a lot of us have seen joy be pushed off to the sort of edges of our lives. And so to me, it's less about, you know, how do I bring joy into this phase of life, but how do I um remember that that's actually my natural state? >> It it feels like a lot of this comes from um being a designer and you having a background in design. So kind of seeing how joy is created through curves or through um a you know a window that's an unexpected shape or through color or through the design of an interaction or an event. Um I think of that as like a much a nuanced sophisticated view of joy that's not just like kids love bubbles and that's great but I think you kind of think about but why what is it about bubbles that we love? For a lot of us, when we think, oh, we're going to make something joyful, we think about what is joyful, and then we just do that. So, it's like, oh, kindergarteners are joyful. Okay, we're just going to put brightly colored bean bags everywhere and we're just gonna, you know, put Legos everywhere and and bubbles and that's just going to make it joyful. And you're right, as part of my work, what I was trying to understand was, you know, what makes these things specifically joyful. And it's understanding that there are sensorial qualities to those joyful things that are repeatable that we can find throughout cultures all over the planet. Um so things like bright color, um round shapes, um a sense of abundance and multiplicity as a a feeling of lightness or elevation, repeating patterns. And it's that level of abstraction of being able to understand what is the essence that's actually making this joyful from a neuroscientific perspective that allows us to then say okay well what's really doing the work of creating the joy is the repetition. It's the repetition of the circular shape and and those two things together are what's creating that feeling of joy. And so we can apply that idea somewhere else and it doesn't necessarily have to feel >> Let's do a quick exercise. What are three things in the last week that have have given you joy? >> You know, they're pretty mundane, but um but I think that's that's the nature of it, right? Is often we're finding joy in these like really mundane things. Um the first is so my son has not been wanting to go to school. Maybe I'm a little bit like too like, you know, get your shoes on, let's go in the mornings. I'm not in the joy mindset. So he started playing a different artist every morning in the car, a different artist from, you know, my childhood, my growing up. And that's been so just watching him get so excited for like what is the artist of the day and what we're going to pick. That has been a really joyful thing for me. >> Oh, I love that. >> Yeah. So maybe that one's not >> It's joyful even just to hear about secondhand. >> Yeah. It's like it's it's like, oh, we can take this thing that we've sort of we've settled into this kind of slump around and we can actually turn that into something um that's joyful. The second is just the sun coming out. It has been really gloomy and we've had like a couple of sunny days and it has just been like giving me so much life. And the third is um I've been planting and so I've been back in the garden. Just really great feeling to be out in the sunshine, hands in the dirt. It's also interesting to note that just remembering and listing those three, I started smiling, you started smiling. There was kind of this second wave of joy of just remembering and reexperiencing a joyful thing. >> Absolutely. Recounting joyful moments is one of the ways to extend and deepen our experiences of joy. And so telling someone about it, a lot of us are taught to sort of downplay our joy either because we're afraid of seeming like we're bragging. Uh we're afraid of seeming like we're silly or frivolous because we're sort of in this very cheerful, joyful state. So sometimes it can be helpful to overexpress because our brains are sort of reading our bodily state. And when we do a happy dance, when we get a good email or, you know, something like that, it sort of sends that BOF feedback that you're in a joyful state and it tends to sort of reinforce that idea of an upward spiral where you're looking now for more joy and you're more attuned to it. >> I love that. I love that. And I'm going to deliberately overemphasize how much I love that as a thing. That's so good. Someone tells you something good or you tell them something good and then you both celebrate it together. That feels so good. >> Yeah, it it feels good and it's also really important. There are all these like viral red flags posts going around or green flags like maybe we'll stay in the green flag but like a green flag in a relationship is someone who will celebrate your good news with you and be actively celebrating with you and they are like you know wanting to build on that. You know you say hey like I I got this promotion and like the they are just like so excited. They want to talk about it with you. They want to hear all about it. They want um you to tell the story over and over again. Go out to dinner with someone else, they're like, ""Tell the story, tell the story."" Right? Like those kinds of that kind of encouragement is, I think, a really positive green flag in a relationship. >> There's lots of things that I like about comedy. But one of the biggest ones is just this not just license, but requirement to walk around the world looking for strange, hilarious, odd things that make me laugh. >> Well, so I call it in my line of work, I call it joy spotting. this idea that you're attuning your senses to what's joyful in your surroundings and you're picking that stuff up. You're sort of collecting it, but you become kind of like this joy or humor collector because you know you have a responsibility to pass it on. >> Like that's what you signed on for is to pass that on and to help other people laugh. And so you're looking for those things with a very generous eye, right? It doesn't necessarily have to be something that is big or momentous. It can it can be literally like I saw this car and it was your favorite color. >> I had to send it to you. You know um they can be very very trivial but I think we forget you know what's great about joy and humor as well is that they're just such great excuses to connect. >> What would you say to a person who is listening and they are saying I got nothing. It is hard to find joy. I do an exercise in my talks where I ask people to close their eyes and I give them prompts um to sort of think of something that might have brought them joy recently. And every talk I often get people come up to me at the end and say, ""I got nothing >> and should I be worried about that?"" Right? It's not that there's anything wrong with you if you can't come up with something. Right? We go through seasons of life where joy is hard to find. Um, but we also sometimes fall out of the habit of it because we went through something hard and we've forgotten to put joy back into our lives or we've forgotten that we're entitled to joy and we know that everything that gives us joy we will lose eventually. So if you've experience that loss, you may you may struggle to find it. And to me, the simplest thing is just um starting this practice of joy spotting or noticing joy around you or trying to pay attention when it just comes over you. Catch yourself smiling, right? Be the observer who catches yourself smiling or catches yourself laughing and notice what's happening in in those circumstances. And then you can start to work on creating more of those moments. joy is in there and it is it is your natural state. There is a a piece of you that still remembers it. Um so and it will feel very familiar when it starts to come back. >> Is there some part of the fleetingness that is also what makes it special? >> I'm really glad you asked this because it's it gets at the evolutionary purpose of joy. >> So we often think of joy as just this nice thing that we have and doesn't really have a purpose. And you know, for many decades in psychology, that was sort of how it was treated because there really wasn't a ton of interest in positive emotions. And so positive emotions were just kind of like this extra and everything was focused on the pathologies, right? On the mental illness and how do we, you know, remedy mental illness. And no one was really thinking about joy. Um, it was just a thing that was like this evolutionary nice to have. And then when psychologists started to dig into it, they realized that like we don't nothing is universal in human nature without a purpose. Joy is one of those seven universal emotions that is consistent in all humans. Then why is why do we have it? And the sort of consensus that emerged is that joy evolved to move us toward things that would be beneficial for our survival and and the thriving of the species, right? And so when we see things that bring us joy, they are um they are signs of what can help us thrive. >> In my personal experience, often people who are doing the on the ground work to address some of the most serious, least joyful problems are really joyful themselves. And I don't think that they see it as a contradiction. >> Yeah, that makes sense. And maybe what we're really feeling when we feel joy when we feel guilty about joy is actually it's guilt about our inaction or our sense of detachment um from the problem and not necessarily actually the joy. Really this idea that joy can thrive even in the most um unexpected places because these are places that experience extreme hardship. Um, and yet joy can be alive and well in those places. >> What are some of the things that you found have most resonated with people and and have been people have been able to put into place in their own life to to bring some more joy into it? >> That's a big question. Um, okay. Uh, one thing that seems to immediately resonate with people is color. This idea that having more color in our surroundings, uh, can create joy in a repeatable way. I think really tends to click for people, especially because, you know, we've many of us are working in offices that are gray and beige. Uh we come home to homes that are kind of white and beige. Um and that, you know, these neutrals have sort of taken hold and we don't really know why they've taken hold. And I think people go and they're like, ""Yeah, why don't I have more color in my life?"" And then they put a little into their homes. you know, they paint a couple walls or they buy something colorful and they bring it home and like even if it's like a colorful coffee mug, it's like something so small and simple or they start wearing more color. And that was my hope for the book that people would start to look at their surroundings in a different way. Of course, I'm also really excited when people who are in involved in spaces in the community start to look at their spaces in a different way. teachers when they start to look at the school environment create more joy in the school building or you know the crosswalks or the playground or you know the areas around the school. >> If you were to say like describe joy all of the examples that I would have given you you said give me 20 examples of joy I would have given you individual or maybe at most family and friend examples. I had would have thought of it in a much more individual way before I read your book. >> Right. I it I think we have a very individualistic society. Right. So we tend to concentrate our efforts uh toward joy in the private realm. The result of that is that our common spaces often when we even have them, right? They lack joy. So like you go to Europe and you have these beautiful common spaces and piazas and places where people gather and you know we lack a lot of those in the US. Um, but even when we do have them, they tend to be focused on commercialism and economic activity rather than on the creation of joy. And so viewing those spaces through the lens of joy, I think, is a we can suddenly see what's missing. So, I'm all for the reintroduction, a reinfusion of joy into our public spaces because I think it's part of what we're trying to achieve in terms of reinvigorating our communal um our communal rituals and our communal life. >> You are the author of a book called Joyful. You run courses for people about finding joy, about decorating with joy, about living with joy. Do you ever feel like pressure to be joyful when you're not joyful all the time? No, I don't think it's a pressure to feel joyful when I'm not. I think it's I have a lot of gratitude for having chosen this lens on the world. And part of that is because again, I don't expect joy to to last. So I know that there are going to be crappy days. And my job on the crappy days is not to force myself to feel joy or put on a happy face. it is to feel the other feelings and stay available to joy. You know, I think the way that I used to think about it was, oh, I'm having a bad day. I just get through this bad day and then I will, you know, maybe tomorrow will be a better day. Now, my mindset is more this is really a bad day and there might be one joyful thing in this day and one day I might not remember all the stuff that was so hard today, but I might remember that. And so I'm just gonna stay available to the possibility of it. >> Ingred, this has been uh such a delight to talk to you. I am always and forever a fan of your work and I'm I'm really glad that you made the time to be on the show. It was it was truly a delight. >> Oh, likewise. It was really fun. Thank you so much for having me.",unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
moZMjD3imN8,"Rob Bredow: Most artists, I think, our first reaction,
my first reaction was like, that seems like a really bad idea. I don't want a machine taking over my job. And then when you start using it,
you realize like, oh, OK, I'm very safe. The machine can't do what I can do. But actually it does help me
with this one part here. And then you start finding little parts
of the workflow that it helps you. Then it becomes a tool,
like a better paintbrush. At that point, we've achieved something that actually can have
a really nice benefit, I think. [Intersections] [Nora Atkinson, Craft curator] [Rob Bredow, Visual effects trailblazer] RB: How do you see like,
in the space that you're in, in museums and curation, how do you see art that has AI
used as one of the tools in it? Do you see it making its way in? Is it going to be 10
or 20 years down the line? Because it's going to be something that gets considered art
much later in the scheme of things? NA: There's a lot of work
being done that's using AI, either as the main focus of the work or at least as part
of the production of the work. And I think it's unfortunate right now
that there are very few people who've made it into
the public eye in that realm. And I hope that a lot more
of those barriers get broken down. I think in part, there's also the sort
of gloss of the new technology, and people are using it
the way it's supposed to be used. But all of my favorite work, typically, is when people get to the point
with the technology that they start to try to break it. And that's what I'm really
looking forward to seeing. RB: Yeah, that'll be really interesting. And that's you know, our uses of AI tend to be more about trying
to get it to do what we need it to do, because our process is very artistic,
but it's very commercial as well. We're doing a lot of work. We're doing a lot of shots in a row,
we're telling a cohesive story, so we always need a lot of control. And that's one
of the reasons our artists -- That's what artists are excellent at. It's getting what we're looking for, fine-tuning the results
to get that high quality of craft. So it is interesting,
we're trying to force these tools that can tend to have a mind of their own, especially if you're just using the stuff that everyone has available
in their social media and things, trying to turn that into something
that is more controllable is a whole operation unto itself. So when you're curating a new exhibit or thinking about the future
of your museum in San Francisco, how do you consider
all the different disciplines that can go into the craft? Is that an important factor for you? NA: I think it is. I think, you know, particularly
with the Museum of Craft, which is what we are, craft was mostly defined by things
that happened in the 20th century. And so we've been trying to break down
the barriers of what that even means. But generally speaking, you know, you think differently
through different media. And so the more media you can include,
the more disciplines you can include, the more sort of inclusive
an exhibition becomes. You bring in different audiences and I like to think about the idea that an exhibition largely
can be about an idea more than it has to be
about a specific discipline. RB: That's so interesting. It’s actually kind of
similar in filmmaking, too. It tends to be a filmmaker, or sometimes a team,
if it's a whole series, that have a very particular vision
and you always know where to go when you have a question
about what you're making, because they're the ultimate
decision makers. But all the different crafts
coming together, it's a collaborative process. And on a common day on the set,
we'll always have more than 100 people. Sometimes if it's
a complicated shooting day, there's 250 people
working in their specialties, and it's down to lighting
and the set dressing and the rest of the rigging
and paint touch-ups and all these things
happening simultaneously. It's one of the things
that makes filmmaking so amazing is that all that can happen in a compressed period of time on the set, just to get that moment
of acting in front of the camera. It's what makes movies
kind of special, I think. NA: So what that reminds me of
is this sort of idea of soul in art. And I know that there was another
TED Talk from a few years ago, there was a composer who came, and he was showing off
that he had created an algorithm that made infinite symphonic music. And it was a fascinating thing that you could create
infinite symphonic music. And there's certainly application
for that in video games and whatnot where you want to go on forever. But of course, it struck me
that music then, what is it, essentially? Is it music? Because it isn't communicating anything. And I think that's really
at the soul of a lot of this. How do you keep the soul in the work? RB: I think it's so important as we
start using more and more AI tools, to have them driven by the people who are the artistic experts
in their relative crafts. I think one of the tricky things about the existing commercially
available tools right now is they tend to be designed for someone who is not going to invest very much time
and wants to get a lot of output. So a little bit of input,
tons of output and it's impressive. It's technically impressive
that it can happen, but it doesn't allow for someone who's a real expert
in the craft to refine that, to get them something
that is maybe a cut above. So you have to figure out. I think we'll be better off when the tools are being designed
for these artists that have the experience. And that'll be interesting to see, because we have a bit of a hump
to get over with the AI tools. NA: Right. I find when I'm experimenting
with any kind of AI tool, that the first time,
it's really, really cool. And after you've done it
for a few sessions, you realize some of the same tropes
come up again and again. And that's where you get
kind of the more, you know, you start to become more adept
at telling a story with it. So I don't think there's any danger
that artists are going to go away. They're just going to transform. RB: Yeah, that's been
our experience so far. I think in concept, most people,
most artists, I think, our first reaction,
my first reaction was like, well, that seems like a really bad idea. I don't want a machine taking over my job. And then when you start using it,
you realize like, oh, OK, I'm very safe. The machine can't do what I can do. But actually it does help me
with this one part here. And then you start finding little parts
of the workflow that it helps you, and then it becomes a tool like,
you know, a better paintbrush. And then I think at that point,
we've achieved something that actually can have
a really nice benefit, I think. NA: For sure. I like to remind people, for instance, that the Jacquard loom
was part of the history of computing, and all these things are part
of the same spectrum. RB: That's such a great example
to really look back. Every time there's been
a technical innovation, there's people wanting
to hold it back for good reason, and then there's people
who want to lean into it. The example we often refer to
is photography versus painting, which of course, when
photography came around, there were a lot of painters saying
it took the painters' jobs, but then the painters became
more expressionistic and did a whole new thing
with that craft that, of course, there's still photorealistic
painters today, but many more of them are able
to express new kinds of things because the photos are doing the job
of just documenting what happened. NA: How does curiosity
play a role in what you do? RB: Well, there's so many
different ways, actually. A lot of the things we invent at Industrial Light and Magic
and inside of Lucasfilm are as a result of a person
or a team getting curious about whether something will work. And our hunches in that area. I mean, of course they're informed hunches
because this is coming from experts, but the areas to explore are almost always
as a result of someone saying, I think there's either a better way or this person needs
to do this impossible thing, and we've got to come up
with some way of doing it. So having that intense curiosity
to want to chase those things down because it's always inconvenient, right? There's never enough time. There's always risk
that it's not going to work. But that's one of the things
that I think people in general, who are attracted to this company to work, they come with a lot of curiosity and a little bit of dissatisfaction
of the status quo. Like, status quo is not quite good enough,
we can do this better. NA: That is why our jobs are fun. Because my job, as well, as a curator, is all about just running down
whatever thing I'm super curious about, because someone else
will be curious about that. And if it really gets you excited, and usually it's a risky proposition, like putting Burning Man
in the Smithsonian, if it really starts to hit that spot
in the back of your brain, you're like, ""Why can't I just do this,"" then, you know, you get the opportunity
to lead that charge. RB: So I'm so interested, I mean, that's an innovative move
to do at the Smithsonian. Do you run into a lot of resistance, or do people who are pushing
the state of the art in museums -- is there a lot of resistance
to the status quo, or is there a lot of like, invitation? NA: So interestingly, again, I'm a curator of craft
in basically an art world, and there aren't very many of us. And craft is kind of a sidelight, and I think it gives us
permission to do things that you couldn't necessarily do
in the art world at large. So Burning Man had been an aspect of art that had been pushed off to the sidelines, and I just started to draw the lines between what was going on
in the craft world and what was going on out there, and seeing the value in something
that wasn't valued. And that's, I think the most fun
that I have in my job, is just trying to see something
from a different perspective and then bring it full circle
and bring other people along, which is probably very similar
to what you have the opportunity to do. RB: Yeah, absolutely. Especially as we look
at new tools, we look at AI, making sure first that we
position it the right way, that it's not about replacing artists, it's about empowering artists and making our craft
as efficient as possible, giving everybody the right tools. I think if everybody
gets on board with that, then we're headed in a useful direction,
which I think is really interesting. NA: I think there's one thing, though,
that I find interesting as well, which is that we're in this moment
when everything is about now and we're progressing
so fast towards the future, and then the sort of subversive act
sometimes is that looking backwards, actually embracing lessons
that we had from the past or amazing people. One of my favorite exhibitions
that I ever curated was a show called ""Murder Is Her Hobby: Frances Glessner Lee and The Nutshell
Studies of Unexplained Death."" And she was a woman
who was creating miniature dioramas that trained forensic investigators
how to approach a scene of the crime in the 19th century, breaking barriers. RB: That's amazing. NA: So it's those opportunities as well, to bring these sort of little-known
things from the past up and have those conversations. Do you have the opportunity to kind of blend old and new
in those kinds of ways? RB: I love that question. That's exactly what we do. And sometimes we look back
at some of those original shots in the original “Star Wars,” and the craft that went into them is, well, first, things like shot composition
and those kind of things, those are timeless. So there's lessons to be learned from the people
who invented visual effects, some of whom we still get to work with, so we can ask them questions
about how they approached it. But also, like when we started
""Star Wars: Episode VII,"" so JJ Abrams’ film,
this was about 12 years ago. We went back to all those miniature shots because we were going
to do most of it with CG, almost all of it with computer graphics. We went back to those original shots
and said, what about that AT-AT Walker is so charming in this original, and what are the things that we want
to preserve from that era or emulate with the new tools? And what are the things
that actually are just artifacts of the old way of doing it and actually they should just be
improved with the new digital tools? So a great example of that is the ships
that, when they were miniatures, the lights could only be so many feet away like the studio we're in now, they can only be 10 or 15 feet away, because at some point
you run into the wall. You’re trying to simulate a sun, but you can only do so well with that. And it turns out, flying a ship
that has mostly flat surfaces with a light that's relatively close and can only be so small, if you're simulating a sun,
it's like infinitely far away. The computer can simulate it perfectly,
but it's a little boring because it's just like
an even illumination of light. But if you have a light
that's relatively close, as the ship flies around,
you get more interesting shading. And we wanted the hard shadows
so you believed it was a sun, but we liked the more interesting shading, so we were able to keep the elements
from the stage photography that we liked and drop the elements
that made it feel a little bit artificial. So those are the kind of details
we kind of obsess over. NA: So it's a really interesting
question because at this moment, you know, I always think that the most
interesting design and innovation comes from the constraints. And at this moment,
we feel very unconstrained. AI is not maybe all the way there yet, but you can just do pretty much anything. So how do you create
the necessary constraint to make something really
interesting and meaningful? RB: Well, I love that question. I think it, especially for storytelling, the constraints make the story. I think we relate to it well because we understand the world,
the constraints of the world. And you set up the rules
in the first five minutes of a movie and you want to adhere to those. So that goes for, I think,
the visual language, the storytelling, how the camera moves. I feel like it's upon us as creators to actually set the rule set for our show so the audience can then relax and go, somebody's thought this through. We know the tone, we know the feeling. I hear people a lot talk about tone
of their favorite shows. And myself, when I see something
that is well crafted, that has a consistency of style
and design through it, I know I'm in good hands
so I can relax and watch the movie. I imagine that's somewhat similar
when you're talking about an exhibit, you're talking about a museum,
laying that out and feeling that design. NA: That consistency. Yeah, I mean, I've been
very fortunate at Smithsonian to work with some really
wonderful exhibit designers, but always it has to be something
conceptualized in your head from start to finish and really
crafted room by room to make sure that people enter into the feeling of the space, as well as just appreciating the object. RB: Yes. Through the course of my work, I've become familiar
with Refik Anadol's work, and I'm just so excited to see the kind of attention
it's getting in museums where people sit there for half an hour
and watch it on exhibit because it's very mesmerizing. It's kind of almost trance-inducing. Is this the kind of thing that, like, you would like to see, in general,
in the museum community, the kind of exhibit
that you would like to see continued to be explored
and pushed forward? Or is it just like the right dose of it
is what we need right now? NA: I think it's important
to have it in the museums, and I'd like to see more of it,
frankly, in the museums, because the faster that we can bring
some of those aspects into museums and allow all of the breadth
of what's going on in that, the more we can document it, but also, the more you
really get a sense for what's possible. RB: The variety of different kinds
of expressions of that might be interesting to see next. NA: I think, just by and large, there hasn't been enough AI art
that has made it into the museum yet. And I see a lot of the early
ages of media art that was collected
so much later in the game, and it's still fascinating because it's the opportunity
to see an evolution in progress. RB: Yeah, and this stuff is so ephemeral, it requires a certain computer
with a certain GPU, like, these are going to be
harder pieces of art to keep and preserve
than a painting on a canvas. NA: Well, there's another
aspect to that as well, which is that I don't think that we need
to be afraid of technology, and people who are doing it
really well should be in a museum, and it should be sitting there
right next to a marble sculpture or a crafted, you know,
a painting or whatnot. Because you're seeing different
types of true skill and value, and it actually lifts the value
of those other things when you see them all in context. RB: I love that. This is the pitch I heard when George Lucas talked
about opening his museum in LA, which is still under development, and I don't have any
inside information about it. But what I heard early on was that it was going to be
classic painting next to a movie poster that was also a fantastic painting, and I don't know if that's how
they're going to end up curating it, but if they do,
that sounds delightful to me. NA: A story is a story is a story. And if it's a great object,
it's going to survive that. I wish for TED that we would
be able to see many more of those handcrafted things
next to some of these AI things. Because I think it enriches both stories. RB: Yeah, they really do
complement each other. Like, we have a shot in ""The Mandalorian"" that I talked about in my TED Talk, where we have stop-motion animation combined with real-time computer graphics combined with a real set, and it's it seamlessly blended
between all three of those live on set, where 100 people can compose
their shots and make a show inside this both high-tech
and low-tech system, which I think, that kind
of combination is really nice. NA: And I think it's that layering
of information again, that now you're looking at this
and the fact that it's seamless, the fact that you're sort of peering
through these different lenses, you can sense it and you
don't know where it happens. That makes it more magical. RB: Totally, that is 100 percent
the right word for it. It is the magic trick when you could never
guess how it would be done. Like, even people who've seen
the behind-the-scenes are like, I know they used LED walls,
I know they did digital extensions. They would have never guessed
it was also some stop-motion in there. And as soon as you start mixing the media, it informs what it looks like. NA: So how much do you care
whether people are coming to the films because they're romanced by the technology or that they're drawn to the story? RB: Oh, I mean, the story
is king, 100 percent. The story has to be the driver
and the characters. You know, when I first got
into visual effects, especially when I first got to the point
where I could help design sequences, because we do a lot of, let's say there's something
like the Kessel Run or something like that in ""Solo."" The visual effects supervisor has a lot
to do with the design of that sequence, trying to make sure we understand how
we're going to approach all those shots. It would be too easy
to lose track of the people when you're just designing
spectacular ship shots. And even knowing that, it's still easy to design in
too many ship shots and not enough shots where
the action is going to take place on the actors' faces. As soon as you shoot the whole thing,
you realize, oh, of course. Every time, I always get reminded,
the story is on the actors' faces. It's not even just their lines. It's their lines, but it's more
their reactions to other people's lines, to what's happening in the world. And you do need a few shots to keep
yourself organized in the geography and to understand the story. But most of it's on actors' faces, which is lovely, because that's what
we love to look at. NA: What do you see
as the limitations now? RB: Oh, I think the opportunity
to continue to give that moment on set, the most information as possible. So some of the reasons
the LED walls are fun is because the actors get
so much more information than acting in front of a blue screen. And I think there's a temptation
to build less and less and to lean into the digital
techniques more. For cost reasons,
for efficiency, to move fast, all sorts of good reasons. But being able to make sure
that set stays a magical space. You know, when we loaded the cast
of “Solo” into the “Millennium Falcon” and there was a wraparound
projection screen, and we didn't tell them in advance
that it could do everything. It could do the whole Kessel Run. We just had stars up there. As far as they could tell,
it was a painting. So they got in there. And this was Ron Howard's idea
not to tell them, let them get up there and experience it. He's like, ""Why don't we do a dry run?"" They're still holding their script,
half-ready for the shoot, so they sit down in their spots. And this is Donald Glover,
Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Alden, I can't remember who else
was in that particular shot. But they're first time in the cockpit,
Alden was playing Solo. So Ron does the countdown and he goes,
""Rob, cue hyperspace."" And so we cue hyperspace and the special effects guys
shake the ""Millennium Falcon,"" and they're just all freaking out in there
because they pulled the lever and went into hyperspace. They didn't expect this to happen. Everybody was yelling and having fun. And then I heard Donald Glover say,
after the take was all over, because I was listening
on the headphones and he goes, ""This is the coolest thing
I have ever done."" Which was just, I mean, to do that
and have that be their first rehearsal, it changes what they're going
to do on screen. NA: It must transform acting. You can really put people there. RB: Absolutely. Giant space monster appears on the screen, everybody knows right where to look,
exactly when to react, you get a different performance
than if you're just saying, ""Look at that tennis ball,
and ready one, two, three."" And actors are great, they can do it. But how much better is it
when you give them the real thing? When you're thinking about how
a piece is going to resonate emotionally with people walking through the museum, or what story you're telling and what you want people
to experience emotionally as they've gone through
a whole part of an exhibit, what are the ways you try to use the art to kind of create certain
emotional feelings? NA: I mean, that's what art is. You're walking through -- You wouldn't put the piece in the museum if there wasn't some kind
of an emotional human resonance to it. So I think that's the glory
of what a museum exhibition can be. I really love trying to create sort
of hidden connections between things in the exhibitions as well, because your brain lights up
as you're looking at all of these things, and you put this over here and all of a sudden it transforms
what the piece is about. So I think it's just
probably very similar to film. It's all about this sort
of emotional storyline. And one of the beauties, of course,
of a museum, similar to film, is that you’re bringing people
through it typically all together. There's a group of people who were
walking through this and having this, you know, multiplicity in that room that are sharing that experience, and the awe and the way one person
will point to something and it brings others into that experience. One of the biggest joys I have
putting together exhibitions is watching people walk through them. And something that touches this person might not be the same thing
that touches someone else, but they bring each other
along on that story. RB: Yeah, that is very
similar in filmmaking, where our best heads of departments, the teams that run all the different
departments that work on the show, they spend so much time with the script, understanding the story, the theme, and then using as many tools as possible to reinforce those themes, those emotions. And sometimes that can be
technique, you know, the choices that are made in the craft. Sometimes that's just a feeling
that everybody's going for. Like some of my favorite movies
have these wonderful color scripts that even before we know
what all the designs are, we know what the mood
of the various scenes are going to be because of the colors that we're going
to establish way early. So then you get back
into that and you're like, how are we going to make
that magenta feel in here? As you're adding in each of the designs so it gives the cohesive flow
over the course of a movie. NA: And then that humanism is messy
and people bring their own lives to it. There's a whole nother overlay
that you never expected. My favorite thing, actually,
is always opening an exhibition because after weeks
and weeks of, you know, well, you know,
years putting together a show, weeks of installing it in the gallery, you're kind of sick
of looking at all of it, and it doesn't register any longer. And then the first people walk in
and you get the wonder on their faces. RB: Dennis Muren,
who is a visual effects supervisor who worked on the original
""Star Wars,"" he said, on ""Star Wars: Episode IV,""
that was our first big movie, right? They'd done all the shots. They could only see the mistakes
that were left in the shots, all the things they wanted to make better. And then he went to the premiere down in Los Angeles, in Hollywood. And he watched the movie
with the audience, and all he was seeing was those mistakes, but he could see everybody else
was seeing the storytelling. And he said, that's when he became
a filmmaker instead of a shot maker. Someone who could see the whole story
instead of just all the different details, which I think is kind of beautiful. NA: Some of those mistakes end up
being the kind of gems in the end product. RB: Absolutely,
perfection isn't necessary. And Dennis would always
be teaching us this. Dennis Muren and Ken Ralston and the teams that worked
on those original films that inspired so many of us in our craft, they're really good at saying, well, that detail over there,
it's imperfect, but it doesn't matter, people aren't looking there. I'd rather spend the time working
on the thing that people are looking at. So there's lots and lots
of great examples of films. NA: We're imperfect. RB: Yeah, exactly. Perfection is not always better. NA: Well, thank you so much,
this has been so fun. RB: It has really been fun. I love learning a little
bit about your world. So thanks for taking the time.",unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
aw59Z8v3LX0,"[Music] When you've had a lot of opportunity taken out of your community, you just feel incredibly powerless. You're not sure where to start. You also don't have the energy to figure out how do you impact something like an economy. Often what we really need is a new imagination. How do we create opportunities that can root wealth and overturn these cycles of generational poverty in our communities? I'm Molly Himmstreet. I'm the co-founder and co-executive director of the Industrial Commons and I work to bring opportunity to rural communities across southern Appalachia. Appalachia for me is a really beautiful place and it is where I call home. I always think the season I'm in is my most favorite season. There's lots and lots of trees, animals, insects. It's my favorite place to be. It's also a really complex place. A lot of the story of Appalachia has been about extraction, things leaving our communities. Where I grew up, we have been manufacturers and makers for generations and particularly textile manufacturing. Textiles are really these workh horses of our world. It's not just the clothing we wear. If I think about the stint that's in my dad's heart that's keeping that heartbeating, that's a medical textile. If you think about a firefighter that walks into a burning building, they're protected by a textile. So much of our world is about fiber and is about the textile industry. And it's really our communities that are helping to ensure that that industry stays vibrant and active in the United States. But around the 1990s into the 2000s, that work left, leaving our communities with upwards of 15% unemployment. Entire families just didn't have work. So I really started asking this question of myself like what do I do as someone who really wants to stay here but someone who wants to be sure that there's opportunity not just for me and my family but for my friends and neighbors. There were several things that I wanted to be different from what I had seen coming down around me. I wanted this to be a profitable enterprise. I wanted it to be about people and I wanted to be sure that we were making things that weren't hurting the environment and I knew that the people in my community had incredible skill and incredible knowledge and so Opportunity Threads was started as an employeeowned company around developing sustainable textiles. The idea of employee ownership is just really really basic and I think we can all relate to it. If we work really hard for something, that reward should come back to us. We all want to feel like we're valued. We all want to feel like the opportunity that we create, the profits that we create, we have a say in those. Opportunity Threads is a really magical place. They're one of the largest upycling facilities in the US, upycling upwards of 60,000 t-shirts every week. They're a profitable company, a really brilliant, bright light in our community. I'm very proud of I'm proud of that work. From there, I was like, ""Oh, this is kind of cool. This seems to be working. Let me find some more help."" I wasn't an economist. Didn't have a business major. Didn't consider myself an entrepreneur. What I did know is that I cared very deeply about where I lived. And so, we started building a network. We called it the Carolina Textile District with this whole idea of being big by being small together. So we were going to band together in order to build scale. And then after we built that, we built the industrial commons. What we do with the industrial commons is we support workers. We support businesses. Some of those businesses we help to buy and convert to employeeowned companies. Some of those businesses we start ourselves. We've drawn the attention of folks like the National Science Foundation who have chosen us as one of 10 innovation communities across the country. And it was really the organization that I needed when I was getting started that I didn't have. One of the projects that the industrial commons right now is working on is called material return. And what we do at material return is we take back the region's textile waste. We grind it up and we send it through this big machine and then we're able to make that back into a yarn. Something that might be sold for 3 cents a pound. If we can put it through our system, it can come out on the other side and we can sell it for $9 a pound. So, we're engineering value back into this waist stream just like we're trying to engineer opportunity back into our communities. Bob has really been the leader that's helped material return get started. He's somebody that grew up in Burke County, started to work when he was 16 in a sawmill. What's so neat about Bob's story is, you know, Bob is still working in manufacturing. In fact, he's working in these same plants where his uncle and his dad used to work. But now he's an owner of that plant. He has a say in what's going to happen at that facility and he's really one of the leaders. So Bob for me really represents why I come to work every day. We call ourselves we're long haul people. We're in this for the long haul. This isn't just a project of 6 months. This is a project of of generations. Right now, there's 27,000 workers working in the textile industry. We would love to see half of those workers engaged in some type of enterprise or economic opportunity that we're creating through our ecosystem. My hope is not just southern Appalachia, but all over that there's more say, there's more wealth that can be rooted, there's less extraction, and there's really just a more thriving working class. Every community has opportunity. Every community has something good in it. Every community has a future where you can show up every day. You can work hard. You can get ahead, but that's not at the expense of the person beside you getting ahead. That there's opportunities for your kids. Where there's a lightness and there's a joy where you really feel like you're not staying because you're forced to stay, but you're staying because you've chosen to stay. We forget that we are part of the economy. We forget that we have power in it. It just takes a few people to start and you don't have to necessarily have a complex set of skills. What you really have to have is a deep care and a deep love and a deep knowledge of where you're planted and where you want to grow.",unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3kkMPD744dY,"Can I get a show of hands
if you know what this instrument is. Great. Five people, that's what I'm here for. (Laughter) So this is a guzheng, an ancient Chinese zither
that has over 2,000 years of history. But growing up in China,
I played the two most popular instruments. Can you guess what they are? It's the guitar and the piano, yeah. (Laughter) Not this. So I wrote a song on the guitar that ended up on one of the biggest
music shows of the time, called Zhōngguó Hǎo Gēqǔ. And at 16, my life changed overnight. I entered this parallel universe
as the Hannah Montana version of myself as a high school kid. I saw my face on news headlines. I heard my music played in public,
which was a weird experience, and I was working with music legends
I grew up admiring, who helped my debut album win
the prestigious Huá Yǔ Bǎng Zhōng Bǎng, also known as the Chinese Music Awards. However, as a Chinese musician,
my music was very ""westernized."" I didn't sound Chinese, and in a way, I'm not sure
if I really wanted to. See, with traditional music,
I didn't really think it was cool. I have to admit, in my language, there's this word for something
that's not cool or backwards, called “tu.” But “tu” literally means the earth
or soil that we stand on. On the other hand,
you have this word called “yangtzi,” which means the opposite, something very trendy
and cool and avant garde. But “yangtzi” literally means Western. And over time, I realized
that this isn't just a Chinese issue, but a global one. Music traditions are dying
in the hands of our generation. But how can we preserve a tradition if we don't feel a personal
connection to it? So I felt inspired to learn
the traditional instrument and folk music to reconnect with my roots. But instead of playing
traditional music traditionally, it's important for me
to be creative with it. So I'm going to show you how I do that. I'm going to play you a song that's a combination
of a traditional folk song, as well as my own composition. I think you can guess which part
is the traditional, which one is not. (Music) (Singing) (Applause) So there's this quote attributed
to the composer Gustav Mahler that I really like. That tradition is not
the worship of ashes but the preservation of fire. And music can transcend not just
the barriers of language and culture but also time and space. For me, music can build a bridge
between the East and the West, the past and the present,
and between you and me. And I've witnessed how music
can reach beyond the limits of not just our human memory
but even our very own consciousness. When my grandmother developed Alzheimer's, we could no longer
communicate through words. However, there was this lullaby that she used to sing to me
when I was a child. It’s a lullaby that her mother
used to sing to her, so it’s been passed down my family
for over four generations. And whenever I sing the melody, she would recognize the melody
and sing along with me, which was really sweet. And even though my grandmother
has recently passed away, whenever I sing this lullaby,
I still feel deeply connected with her. It's almost like she's still

kAFBhYRlkZc,"Hello and thank you for watching TED Explains, where we take the biggest headlines of the moment and offer clarity around what it all means and context on why it matters. I'm Whitney Pennington Rogers and I'm your host for this conversation. These days, it's virtually impossible to watch the news and not see stories about migration. It is and has always been the defining force of humanity. Around the world, people are on the move for an array of reasons, from climate change to conflict to economic shifts and of course the enduring human pursuit of opportunity and safety. And yet, the headlines often reduce migration to crisis and controversy, leaving out the bigger picture that movement is a natural, even necessary part of who we are. As borders tighten and debates intensify, it's more important than ever to understand what's really driving migration today, how it's shaping our global future, and what it means for all of us. To help us make sense of this moment, I'm thrilled to be joined today by two big thinkers in the space of human migration. Journalist Sonia Shaw, who is a past TED speaker and an author whose most recently released book, The Next Great Migration, unravels our historical understanding of migration and its impact on the present moment. and Z Hernandez, who is a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School and the author of The Truth About Immigration, which examines immigration's impact on the economy and beyond. Hello to you both. >> Hi, thanks for having us. >> Hi. Yeah, great to be here. >> Thank you both so much for being here. Well, we have so much to to get into, so I'm just going to dive right in. And I think one of the the bigger questions around this issue when we think about migration is looking around to understand whether or not this moment feels different and actually whether it is different from others we've seen in history. So so that will actually be my first question. I'd love to to maybe start with you with you Sonia um in in the work that you've done. You've you've sort of looked at the history of of how uh we've migrated. How does this moment compare to others in history? I think um the most striking thing about the present moment is that u migrants are being scapegoed for a lot of our social problems, economic problems um in a way that does feel quite new. But what isn't new is the migration that's been happening kind of all along. I don't know that we really track migration that well. There's there's a lot of different flows of migration and we only really look carefully at a very few of those. Um, so I'm not I I don't feel confident in our the way we assess global migration. I don't think we have a very good idea of how much people are moving around the planet. But from what we can tell through history, we're looking from the very beginning when humans first walked out of Africa, we have been moving all along in complex ways um to and fro movements across mountains, across oceans, across deserts. And we've been doing it since, you know, with stone age technology. People walked up into the heights of the Himalayan mountains where there wasn't enough oxygen during, you know, mill thousands of years ago. People paddled out of Asia into the featureless expanse of the Pacific Ocean multiple times using stone age navigation technology. Um, and that's how you know that's that's kind of been the human experience from the beginning. So what's happening now is we are moving in somewhat new ways because of climate change and other factors, but I don't think there's any really good evidence that we're moving a lot more in in in a way that's commensurate with the backlash we are seeing to migration today. >> So you're suggesting then Sonia that we're you're we're not actually seeing people migrate more than in the past. It just feels like it based on the way the media is covering it. I think the media and uh and political leaders that are really highlighting migration as sort of the cause of a lot of our problems, you know, in a way that that's easier for them to do than to actually address some of those underlying problems. >> Well, I think that actually leads to uh another point here, which is is that migration has been a really huge political topic these days. And I think um one thing I find really interesting is that you both sort of make a point to tackle this topic from a place that largely leaves politics out of it and is is sort of just looking at the what you find to be the facts and the things that you've studied. How do you think politicization of migration has um impacted the way people think about migration? I'll ask you uh this seek because I I know that's a a huge part of your work in thinking about um migration and how it sort of intersects with um econ economics. >> Yeah, I I I think I want to start by re-emphasizing something Sonia mentioned that people have always moved and really as a as a fraction of the world population. Uh migration there's no indication it's any bigger than it has been in at least in our modern era. Uh for example, most people don't realize that uh immigrants are only about 3% 3 and a half% of the world population. Another way to say that is like over, you know, about 97% of people never move uh across countries. And so we're talking really about something that in the grand scheme of things is not that large. It's just that there are waves uh of time under which um for political reasons uh migrants are whether it's scapegoed or resisted or not. And so this moment to me is very similar than about a hundred years ago uh in the early 1900s uh with the science of the pseudocience of eugenics uh and and other you know supposed national security concerns there was kind of a wave of resistance to immigrants to give an example from the United States in in 1924 the US passed its most restrictive immigration law in history as a conclusion to a moment that's very very similar politically to the moment that we're living right now. Uh and then in 1965 sort of the borders were were opened again and we went through a a wave of sort of modern mass migration. That has been true in many many other countries. Uh to me what feels a little bit different historically this time is that there seems to be more of a wave of many many countries uh uh wanting to be more restrictive about immigration under the argument that immigrants are creating sort of economic and social problems even though the evidence doesn't hold that up. So there's a big discrepancy between politician between what politicians are claiming and what the facts say that seems to be more coordinated globally than than right now. And what's ironic about that uh which is unlike any other moment in recent history is that our populations are shrinking. Birth rates have gone below replacement in most immigrant receiving countries. Whereas in the past we were receiving immigrants as a natural population was also increasing. So ironically countries need immigrants more than ever but they're resisting them in a uniform way more than in the recent decades. You touched on this a little bit, Zeke, but when you think about the sentiment then around immigration that feels like that is something then that as we're looking at how things are changing as far as the politics and culturally the way we think about it. Do you feel that there is a um a sentiment that is more anti-immigrant these days than we've seen in the past? I' I'd love both of your takes on this, but Zeke, um why don't you start since you touched on this a little bit? >> Yeah. Honestly, no, I don't think so. I think there has always been resistance to immigrants. uh in in you know in just about every country uh I think uh the fear of the unknown literally creates um uh creates concern about people. Uh the two common concerns are you know that immigrants are going to sort of fundamentally change the culture uh of a society and the other one is that immigrants compete economically with uh with locals. Uh and I'm sure we'll get into that. I won't address um all the all the evidence suggesting that those fears are unfounded. I think just what changes are the political moments, right? Um there are politicians who always have taken advantage of that. Um and and and there are waves in which that goes up and down, but there has always been resistance. Um what I do want to emphasize though is that the average person, the majority of people tend to like immigrants. So it's usually a minority that is against immigrants. And what changes is just there are moments when that minority controls the conversation. And we're in one of those moments right now. And and Sonia, sort of turning to you, I think to even add to this, I'd love your thoughts on what you think are um the fundamental differences we're seeing in our world that might contribute to the way we think about migration as you've looked at it over over history. >> Yeah. Um, well, I want to respond to something Zeke just said actually, which is I think it's it's true that there is often resistance to migration, especially if you make migrants conspicuous, but if you don't make migration conspicuous, then people assimilate very quickly. And we can see this in our biological genetic structure that whenever human groups have, you know, dispersed, isolated, become separate, culturally distinct, but then they come together again, if they overlap, if their territories overlap, they mix, they meld, they make families together. That is why all of our genes are mixed up the way they are. So geneticists know this. They can see this in our population structure. And what social science has found is that the the the sentiment of xenophobia isn't isn't automatic. Like it doesn't happen everywhere where new people come in. If new people come in and there's no actual barriers to their entry and their assimilation and those new people are not made conspicuous by say policies that say you have to wear this kind of you know ankle bracelet or you have to line up in this line here and we can see you or you know something like that. If there's not those kind of exclusionary policies that make migrants conspicuous and migrants assimilate into the local culture extremely quickly and that is why you know yes migration is it's only 3.5% of the global population but we are all touched by it. Very very very few humans today are more than a few generations removed from an act of long-distance migration. For me it's my parents. for Donald Trump, it's his parents. For Steve Bannon, it is just a few generations ago. So, we all have been touched by this in some way. Um, so xenophob xenophobic uh, you know, backlash, it's the potential is there, but we also have an even greater potential for assimilation. And that I think is in the broader picture. That is actually what happens with most migration is most migrants, we don't notice them. They are the they are like you know the the the blood pulsing through our veins where it's beneath our notice. Um it just happens and it's part of the way societies function. It's part of how we have evolved to respond to you know living on a dynamic earth that has changing conditions all the time. And you know, I think I'd love to to get into that more too, just sort of thinking about um how migration really affects the way we live our lives and affects um our our world. And of course, we know that there are a lot of reasons why people migrate. And we're using migr migration as sort of this umbrella term to talk about people who are immigrating by choice. Um people who are refugees and fleeing something. um and the the media regardless of of what type of migration is happening we see is often painting human migration as either good or bad but it seems the truth um is a a bit more gray as is the case with most things right um so I'd love to break that down and maybe um in specific areas so maybe we could first start with um the economy which of course um Zeke I know this is your uh real specialty in thinking about migration and the economy how how do you see migration um is impacting the economy both uh within um national local sort of local national level um and then thinking globally look we have very good evidence on this uh I think when it comes to to immigration in the economy the story is overwhelmingly positive and I think it's scientifically dishonest to say anything else right if you talk to anyone who studies the data immigrants are net positive economic contributors the simplest way I can put it is to use the five fingers of my hand right in in that immigrants bring five key economic inputs that everybody wants and and they're the following. First, they increase the amount of investment in your community. Second, they bring talent, right? They fill jobs and they bring skills. Third, they bring innovation. A lot of the new technologies, products, foods that you consume and make your life better were introduced by immigrants. Uh fourth, they're consumers. So, they buy the goods and services that are produced that businesses desperately want to sell. and five, they pay taxes. Now, I don't know anybody, I don't know any mayor, president, governor, uh, average citizen, business person that says, ""No, I do not want those five things."" Okay? And, um, of course, the numbers attached to those five things vary a little bit by country. Uh, but but you can sort of put it in the bank that immigrants will bring those five things. And those five things are what creates jobs, what causes the economy to grow. Um, again to use an example from the United States because it's the country that I study the most, right? We know that immigrants are nearly one in five workers in the US, but more than one in five in key sectors that we depend on, both high and low skill. Immigrants are responsible for over a third of all patents in the United States. That is a staggering amount of innovation, right? Immigrants have well over a trillion dollars in spending power, etc., etc., etc. we can kind of um quantify the same for different countries. And so, you know, we need those things desperately. And and when you make the case that way, then it's much easier to think of why we want legal and regular pathways for immigrants to come. Uh because we all we all need that. And again, remember, we're in an environment where populations are otherwise shrinking. So, we have no source of economic growth other than immigrants. there is no other way that economic growth will happen other than with immigration at least in countries u that tend to be sort of the rich countries that receive immigrants around the world and Sonia I I know historically you've sort of seen what uh the conversation around migration has looked like as it relates to things like uh safety and and security and that that's often in um in the media and when we talk about the politics around migration uh is a big point of of conversation around whether um spaces become less safe because there are migrants there. Are you making spaces safer by removing people from a space? How how do you see that migration actually does affect uh safety and security? >> Yeah, I mean I actually got into studying migration uh from the perspective of public health risks. So I you know my book previous to the next great migration was a book about pandemics. And uh after I finished that book, I I there was a big movement of people across the Mediterranean, people from North Africa and the Middle East trying to get into Europe. This is around 2015. And uh I went there because I thought to do some reporting because I thought, well, this is a public health risk, right? This is like a health security issue with huge movements of people into new places. That's how you can spark epidemics. So I went there to do this reporting project and what I found was it was exactly the opposite that in fact the people on the move were healthier than the host populations in which they were entering. They had less communicable diseases, less non-communicable diseases. They smoked less. They had less obesity. They had all these great health practices. And if they get sick, they get better faster. if they get say even cancers they'll they won't die as quickly like there's all this amazing medical phenomenon that's very well defined very well documented and it's called the healthy migrant effect um and you know it it it sort of is what took me on this journey of like well why did I immediately think oh people are moving it's it's a crisis right it's a migrant crisis these two words just go together right they just roll off your tongue it's in all the headlines if there's migrants there's a crisis well it turns out that's it's ex it was exactly wrong. Um and so I uh you know I wanted to kind of investigate why is it that we automatically think of migration as a crisis. Um and I think the idea of the the healthy migrant effect really goes to the you know the point Zeke was just making about innovation and diversity. It takes a certain kind of person to make migration work effectively, right? Like you migrants are not people who are kind of the richest of the rich who have a lot of assets, who have titles, who have, you know, this kind of capital that they can't really take with them to new places. They're also not the poorest of the poor. They're people who have what's, you know, mobile capital. They have things they can take with them. They have skills, education, good health. You know, these are the things that are portable that you can take with you and what make it possible for people to move because of course migration is disruptive. It is very risky to actually accomplish it. So the people who actually can do it have all of these qualities that contribute to the kinds of uh benefits, economic benefits that Zeke was just talking about. Um and they, you know, they that really goes to how you get diversity and innovation in a society, right? Like people move into new places, they adapt to those places. They maybe come up with ways of using the local foods, new cuisines, new ways of thinking, new ways of housing themselves, new ways of doing technology. All these ways you adapt to a new place. And then when they move, they bring some of that with them. And that is kind of the insertion of diversity and innovation into new societies is the dispersal of this innovation that gets that evolves you know as we adapt to new places. So migration and innovation it's all it's all kind of wrapped up in this you know dynamic tension. So if we want those benefits we need to you know we need to cap we need to capitalize on all that minimize the risks minimize the costs and and capitalize on those benefits. It's it's a it's you know we're really seeing a backlash to that whole equation right now which is why uh you know I mean why we're having this conversation to be to be frank right >> yeah could I respond to that for a second of course yeah I mean I I just want to expand on it really I I I agree with what Sonia is saying u but I think it's very important for for um so for us to understand where a lot of the concerns about immigrants come from and and strangely they come from sort of importing ideas about um sort of natural ecological systems with limited resources to human systems and human populations, right? And the the core idea uh that that has uh really been at the root of a lot of the anti-immigrant movements is the the idea of carrying capacity, right? That a natural ecosystem reaches its limit and cannot sustain anymore uh because resources run out and then you just have competition for resources. But the the fundamental misunderstanding of that is that human and economic systems are not that way, right? Because because because of innovation, humans can increase the so-called carrying capacity of a system, right? Uh you know, for example, humans are unlike animals uh in that they can they can invent solutions to their problems and and work their way through them. They can produce more. And so often the fallacy is that we think of new people just as consumers, but not as producers. And that's producers of new ideas, producers of a lot of different things. And so once you understand that and you kind of uh detach yourself from that fallacy of you know human systems being identical to like uh you know your backyard, right, which is kind of this closed sandbox with limited carrying capacity, you start to realize that more people actually is often the solution and new people in particular, not just more but also new people because they bring this variety, right? whether it's a variety of of of you know uh you know human physical health systems or a variety of ideas or or other assets as an economist would say it uh that's so important because if you look at actually you trace the lineage of our current anti-immigrant movements and think tanks in many parts of the world they started with this idea of carrying capacity being limited >> well you know and I think obviously it feels like the biggest marker of how immigration is is impacting things or changing things will have to do with actually our our own identities and how our sense of self and how migration is changing the way we we think about even our our own humanity. Um when you see uh folks entering a space and uh this is how we define what it is to be human and and figure out um who we are. So, I'm curious what you both think as far as how immigration has affected our identities and um and the way we think about about who we are. And maybe Sonia, we could start with you. >> Yeah, I mean, I think it goes back to how we think of our kind of place in nature. you know, um, Zeke just pointed out the idea of the carrying capacity, and I think a lot of our anti-immigrant rhetoric does trace back to these biological ideas, these ideas about nature and um, and which are actually outdated in biology itself. So, ecosystems are not these uh, they don't have settled carrying capacities either. Other species are moving around just as much as we are, we're finding. And they also do create technologies if you can you know if you think about the web of a spider or the nest of a bird being a kind of technology for those species. So we are not exceptional in moving around the planet either. Um and this has been happening all along. Um so and the reason we can say that is you know why why are we doing that? Well uh in evolution we know things that last over time that get dispersed throughout all these different species. It's because the benefits outweigh the risks over time. And so migration is sort of our adaptive solution to life on a dynamic planet. And that's not just true for us. That's true for all these other species. And we're learning that now because we have things like solar powered GPS tags that we can put on animals and actually see where do they go? Uh, you know, actually study that perspectively. This is something new. This is a lot of new knowledge we're getting now. And what scientists are finding is that all these other species are moving farther, faster, and in more complex ways than anyone ever thought was possible before. Um, so you know, the story of migration is just it's it's it's expansive and it's not just in humanity. And so I think we need to rethink what is our place in nature. There's this very old idea that goes back to Lanaeus that there is some kind of, you know, a settled order in nature that Everything belongs in a certain place, right? We name things that way. We say, uh, you know, there's the the Japanese maple or the Canadian goose. You know, we associate the place and the animal as if one they're the same thing. Well, now we know these animals are moving all over the place. They don't sit in certain fixed places on the planet at all. Um, and that's true for us, too. We've all been moving all along. So we need to kind of rethink our ideas about nature I think and and our place in nature as well. >> And Zeke, what have you um what have you found in this space that how is this changing the our sense of self? >> Yeah. Yeah. Obviously on a shorter time scale than what Sonia spoke about. The evidence on this is also um pretty good uh in that uh you know im immigrants assimilate successfully to society to to the to the values and the economy and the language uh of a receiving society. Um now the way that we the way that we stop that we can we can um slow down the process if we uh threaten immigrants uh or if we uh put in place policies that are dysfunctional and slow down the process. Right? We can do that. Uh usually the way we do that is that we we tend to also um have another fallacy and you know similar to the fallacy of carrying capacity. the fallacy that cultures are two are are competing uh um entities, right? So that so that cultures exist on a continuum and if you and if you move towards one, you have to move away from the other and and therefore we insist that immigrants assimilate. But the mental model we have is that assimilation means abandon your previous identity, right? Abandon your previous language, abandon your previous cultural values, abandon what you used to eat. Uh but we know from cultural psychology that cultures can coexist. They're not competing uh ends of the same continuum, but they exist kind of orthogonally, right? And so you can a person can be highly attached to two different cultures or they can be detached to both or they can be more attached to one or the other. The most successful immigrants and the most successful societies that receive immigrants allow people to be who they were and also add something new to their identity. Uh, as it turns out, I'm an immigrant from Uruguay and South America. I feel very American, but I also feel Uruguayan. I am both, right? You can't tell me that I'm not both. Uh, and so once we accept that uh that model of cultures as not competing, but complimentary things, then immigrants can uh kind of overcome that paradox of being from another place, but also fully being from the new place. And all the evidence suggests that when allowed to do so, immigrants will uh successfully assimilate. Um they will not when we tell them that they have to give up their previous identity. And so uh once our policies are designed around that principle, uh things work out uh you know things work out just fine. And and if I if I'll be allowed to just say just one more thing about this. Um the other thing is that any changes that immigrants bring to society, you think of Italy as a good example, right? A place with iconic food, right? Italy wouldn't have Italian food had it not been for immigration, right? Uh a lot of the innovations in Italian cuisine came because uh Italians left, Italians returned. Italians sent back ingredients and ideas uh from the places they settled. And so a lot of the modern Italian foods that we associate with being like always Italian didn't even exist a hundred years ago, right? They were they existed because of a process of migration. And so uh so immigrants will change things but they change them very slowly, right? To the point where like the next generation doesn't see what immigrants bring as exotic. So we also have to take a long-term view, right? It's not like immigrants will change and disrupt society so quickly that we cannot adapt. Um, so yeah, that's what the social science tells us. >> Now, I think it's uh to this point, we've largely talked about the effects of migration from what feels like a positive lens, maybe some of the benefits that are not often highlighted um in the media. But I' I'd love to hear from both of you because I I I I know you you both acknowledge in your work that there are some negative uh social effects of of um migration um and beyond just, you know, the these positive implications. And so what are what are some of these major um negative effects and how do you think we can work to reduce them? Uh so maybe Sonia, we'll start with you. >> Yeah, there's no doubt about it. Migration is disruptive. It's a change and all change is difficult. You have to adapt to it. You have to make allowances for it. I think uh if we accepted migration is a part of nature. It's part of the human experience. It's part of innovation and resilience. It's how we secure that for our future generations. then we could look at migration as an investment and we could say well let's try to minimize the disruptions so we can maximize the benefits because this is part of what is happening this is part of our society it's part of our future um and I think there's ways to do that and you know I think a lot can be done with pace the pace of migration the direction of m migration these are the even the the potential large scale if you you know meter the pace um so if you create more avenues for legal migration right now. For example, um people are moving because the climate's changing. You know, desertification. If your fields are drying up and your kids are not going to be able to make money uh farming anymore, then it's likely that they're going to start looking for looking to move first to a city and then maybe to another country. Um that is how migration unfolds. Well, if we know that's we know that's coming, we know that's happening. But there is literally no nowhere on earth where it is legal to move because of climate change. We don't have that infrastructure at all. Um so that means that what happens instead is that you have people kind of trapped in places where conditions are changing too fast for them to adapt to and they need to leave to you know to secure their their futures and that of their children but they have no pathway for that. So what happens? Well, you they wait for a disaster, right? A big storm comes or a dust storm dust bowl happens or you know something like that happens and then everyone has to move all at once and you have these mass movements that are the most disruptive of all. So, you know, by not creating those avenues beforehand, we actually are making migration more disruptive. And I think, you know, in in fact, what we're seeing right now is that there are enough political regimes that find disruptive migration to be a good problem to have because this is something they can crack down on. They can make it look like they're really doing something and it takes everyone's attention away from the actual underlying problems which are really, you know, quite difficult to solve. >> And and what about you, Zeke? What have what have you seen as some of the negatives? >> I I think it's really important to separate two things, right? It's immigrants and what they do and the immigration systems we have in place to manage the flow. Right? Empirically speaking, there's very little that's wrong with the first. Right? When immigrants arrive, like I said, they bring those five economic things. They're highly adaptable. They're law-abiding. Something we haven't talked about is that the myth of immigrants increasing crime is just a myth. It's exactly the opposite. So, what immigrants do is overwhelmingly positive. There are not too many negatives there. the systems we use to manage their flow though there's a lot of negatives and so in as much as we see negatives whether it's social backlash uh or concern or disorder or chaos it's it's like Sonia was saying it's because we don't have proper systems um and so I think what's what's wrong is it's just that we uh if you look at most countries uh with very very few exceptions the way countries have designed their immigration systems has been under the principle of keeping people out blocking them, right? We don't want these people as opposed to the premise immigrants bring these positive things and let's design a system around harnessing those benefits in a way that is that is orderly, right? That is certainly true of the US system. That is certainly true of most systems in Europe um and in in a large immigrant receiving countries. So when you change the default from blockage to flow, you get a very different system. The problem is that we don't think about it that way and and it comes down to like Sonia was saying a flash point where too many people arrive in one single location um you know in a short period of time. Uh and so I think that um a lot of it comes down to not so much managing immigration but managing infrastructure. For example, if too many people settle in one place at the same time, you are going to get something like a housing shortage or the roads will be crowded or schools will be a little bit crowded. But that tells us more about our inability to be thoughtful and build infrastructure effectively than a",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
out what immigrants do themselves. Does that make sense? So, a lot of it is is about um we don't have good systems to manage flows of people. Uh and and I think it probably would be worth spending a few minutes on that, but um maybe I'll stop there for now. >> That's great. And I I definitely do want us to at the end uh sort of get to a place of talking about what how do we redesign some of this and rethink this? But but before we even get there, um I know that there's so much that you've already sort of touched on in thinking about where things are headed um and how the future might unfold and and so taking into account things like you know Sonia, you touched on climate change and I know that your your work um in many ways is thinking about migration as a result of climate change or um as it's uh you know affected by climate change but then of course other things like conflict and you look at declining birth rates which you touched on Zeke and and what that um you and booms in other places. Uh how do you predict migration will change in the coming decade or even century if you're you know looking out further? Um and and Sonia, I'd love you to start uh since you have such a a great historical sense of of how migration has played out over over the course of humanity. >> Um I I think we might see some broad like right now we're seeing about 80% of other species are on the move. They're moving into new places. Um and that's in sync with the changing climate. they're moving uh into higher latitudes. They're moving higher up into higher altitudes and that is so that they can stay within the climates that they are they are adapted to. Um so you know that's not how humans are moving yet but I think it takes time and I think uh right now we have a lot of barriers political barriers that say well you can't move for this reason and you can't move here and you can't move there. Um but if we were to sort of start to overcome some of that and I think you know I think policy works to some extent to uh deter migration these you know we have more walls on border international borders today than at any time but it has more of a deflecting effect than a deterrent effect. People still want to move and they still will move. It's like throwing a boulder in a stream right like people find a way to go around and a lot of times uh people will take more dangerous routes. So like Zeke was saying, we don't have a s we really don't have a system for moving people around the planet in a safe, orderly and dignified fashion. We could create that if we wanted to um and things would be quite different, but that's not what we have. So we, you know, the system we have now is about well let's make sure people don't move or don't move too much or don't not these people that these people don't move, right? So all of these uh barriers we erect actually um you know can make migration far more dangerous. Um but I think what we'll see in the longer picture is you know in the past we've seen big movements that are going east to west. Generally human populations have been flowing that way. But if we were to sync up with climate change we would start seeing more south to north movements. That is what we're seeing in other species. Um humans are animals like other species. So, you know, I expect over time that that's what's going to be happening in the kind of bigger picture for human migration, too. >> And um and see, you know, you also touched on um this idea of of policy. And so, maybe that's something we could also bring in to this um conversation when you think about um what migration might look like in the years to come. um what might policy look like to to help for what sounds like what you're suggesting Sonia and also Z love your take on this if that will be sort of inevitable that people will continue to migrate. >> Let me let me perhaps say it even more strongly and more provocatively. Um you know we're in a moment right now where it seems like immigration is is unpopular. It's not on average but it is for many governments. But I think we're going to see a future very soon where countries are going to go go from immigration choosers that is you know kind of choosing their pick of the litter to immigration beggars. Countries will be desperate for people. And it's simple math. You need 2.1 uh you know uh uh you need a fertility rate of 2.1 on average to just maintain the population. In most countries we're well well below two. And there is no other source of economic growth um uh of of fiscal security. There's no other source of of just maintaining our resources than people. And so uh for a long time the world population has been growing that is going to plateau. And so there's going to be a lot of competition for talent and for people. And so I think we're going to look back at this moment and kind of scoff, right? I'm not saying maybe in 5 years, but definitely by the time my kids are adults, I think we're going to be scoffing at this moment because countries are going to be putting in place, putting in programs, excuse me, out of sheer demographic desperation to attract more people, at least at least wealthier countries will. So, I think we're going to see a lot more immigration openness. And then if you couple that with climate change and um kind of these these push factors like war uh there's going to be uh more I think more movement and probably you know ironically perhaps more orderly than now just because the need on the receiving side is going to be much uh much bigger. Uh that's my that's my sense of uh of where we're going. I don't know if I answered the full question you asked, but >> No, that that's great. And I and I'd love for you, Sonia, to to sort of even respond to some of this like this idea of um migration becoming inevitable because of the push factors and also as um Zeke mentioned, these um these choosers, you know, who h who have to um choose to immigrate uh for the flourishing of their own of of of a nation. Um, do you see this? Do you think this is going to be an inevitability that all of us should begin to think of ourselves as migrants in some way? >> I mean, I think we all are migrants in some way, except for a very, very few of us who are still in, you know, parts of Africa and have stayed there since the dawn of humanity. Um, even when we first walked out of Africa, actually, we walked into Europe and Asia and North America, there already were other humans there, other human species that are now extinct. So even that was a migration that wasn't just we populated the empty earth. No, there were already other humans there, Neanderthalss, others. Um and we intermingled with them too. We a lot of people today still have Neanderthal genes. Um because that's what we do as humans. We mix. Um so migration has been complicated from the very beginning. We now know from paleogenetics that, you know, people walked out of Africa, came into North America, and then they didn't just stay there. They went back to Asia, they went back to Europe, they went back to Africa, they came out again, they went, you know, it's been this complex story from the very beginning. Um, and so I think what we're seeing is just it's going to continue because that's that's just how it has been. Um, we have new drivers today because of climate change. So like I said, I think that's going to change directionality to some extent. But you know, I think the idea that well, uh, you know, there was this idea we all grew up with in my generation that, you know, we kind of walked out of Africa and then we we po populated the planet and then we just stayed still for thousands and thousands of years until sort of modern uh, you know, travel made it easy to move around like airplanes and ships and stuff. But what we now know is that we didn't need any of that. we were moving all along. Um, and we have evidence of that in our bodies, in our DNA. We all carry that around with us. So, um, yes, migration is, uh, at any one moment in time, it's a small number of us that are moving around, but we are all really touched by migration in a very profound way. So, and and I think the reason why is because because it's been so critical to how you have innovation, how you have resilience, how you have diversity. This is why so many conservationists are actually trying to build bridges for other species so that they can move into new places because we know that if they can move into new places, we can secure biodiversity in the future. And we want that. We should want that same thing for us, human diversity. That's what gives us resilience, too. So, you know, again, I mean, this is I don't know if this is the the specific answer to your question, but it kind of gets back to the same the same sort of overall theme, which is that migration is not the crisis. Migration is the solution. Um, and for, you know, if you go back to well, what is the crisis? It's it's it's not a migration crisis. It's a crisis of welcome. It's a crisis of the fact that we don't have any system to to actually, you know, get people around into places where we can take advantage of all the benefits that they bring. >> That really does then get to this this point around the sentiment of it. And you you know you've seen nations that have had at one point um very migrationfriendly policies have become more populist and nivist and um in recent years decades um a lot of spaces in Europe for for instance and um the question I then I guess then is if migration is the answer how how do we um change the sentiment? How do we avoid people swinging um to the other side here in in ways that we can almost predict as we're, you know, seeing people push in um push out of certain spaces and into other spaces more. Um Zeke, maybe you could take that to start. >> Yeah, I mean I think that we've made a huge mistake in the narratives that we tell ourselves about immigrants which deeply affect the sentiment. And um uh the way I often put it is that basically there are two stories that we have told ourselves and people believe sort of one of the two. The first is the immigrants as villains. The villain story, right? That immigrants are here to you know take your job and you know steal your house and your car, right? To commit crimes that they're here to change the the cultural heritage heritage that you love so much. Meaning that immigrants are here to to take stuff and and and they're villains, right? And so if if someone if a villain is at your door, you should kind of, you know, block them and build walls to keep them out. What what's interesting to me is not that there's always been an anti-immigrant message or the villain message. What what is fascinating to me is that um in some ways the more pro-immigrant message is what it is, and it's what I call the immigrants as victims, right? uh you know the needy outsiders who who who are who are just desperate and we have to extend a hand of of kindness and charity to them even if it costs us a lot. Um, right. And so then we, you know, we have kind of the bleeding heart type message that is perhaps more open to immigrants. But it but it but it what's interesting is that villain and victim can be perfectly consistent with each other because even if you have a bleeding welcoming heart, it still opens up leaves open that possibility, well maybe this is very costly for our society both economically and culturally. And the reality is that immigrants are neither villains nor victims. But as long as we keep kind of telling ourselves these stories and and public opinion and our policies keep swinging right and the pendulum goes from villain to victim and back and forth we end up with really dysfunctional policies. So I would say that the the way we start is very simple. We start with a very different premise. Immigrants are good for us. That is immigration is good for us not just for the movers. It's good for the receivers. Right? Right. And it's good for us for the economic reasons and social and other reasons we've been talking about for the health reasons that Sonia mentioned. Once you start with that premise that immigration is good for us, then you have a third possibility that's neither villain nor victim. It's that immigrants are essential for our health and prosperity in in in every possible way. Once that message is taken along, then we can design the systems and we can change mindsets. What I find remarkable is that there's almost no political parties in the world that have that positive premise in their immigration platform. Certainly, it's not true of Democrats or Republicans in the US. Uh and it's not true of almost any party that I know of in Europe or Australia or, you know, anywhere. Uh and so I think that's the opportunity. The good news is though that the empirical evidence is very much in favor of that third uh that third message that immigrants are good for us. So, it's not just rhetoric, it's it's really fact. If we start there, I think the rest will follow. And I'm not naive in that. Of course, there's a lot of politicking and hard work involved in changing public opinion, but but that's the start. We need a better message. And Sonia, as we um think about the future and sort of where things could head, uh it feels like it's always important to kind of think back to the past and what we have seen and what h and what are some lessons that I that we could take from the past when it comes to migration to help us shape a future here um around how we move? >> You know, I always think about I think it was in the 1980s and the Republican primary debates um and I think it was it was Reagan and and maybe it was Bush also. Anyway, they were they were arguing with each other over who was more whose policy was more welcoming to immigrants and and this was this was in living memory you know I I I was alive then and you know think so things can change quite rapidly politically I think um and I think what's quite interesting about the current moment is a lot of people who thought that uh they wanted to get rid of immigrants because they thought they were these villains that they we've been told that they are in in uh you know by these political leaders. Um and then they see well masked men have come into my community and they have abducted this woman who I was part of my you know everyday life who I I actually really enjoyed and was my neighbor. This person who ran the doughnut shop or this person who was my kid's teacher or this person who used to you know uh uh be my my coworker. and these are members of the community and now suddenly they are kind of outed as oh you're a migrant we didn't know we thought you were just one of us right so but there's a lesson in there and it's a very very cruel way to make this lesson it's a brutal policy that we're seeing unfold here in the United States but what is happening in a lot of these communities is people are realizing well m these migrants these immigrants they're everywhere they are part of our neighborhood they are part of our community they're part of our culture and I I I would I would hope that that that is that that that profound experience to know that migration is not something that happens elsewhere. It's not these others, these aliens, these, you know, people who look different from us who we can keep at that would never assimilate into our communities. No, they that's not who they are. Um and we are now seeing that because our communities are actually being torn apart by these you know uh by this deportation secret police kind of regime that we're seeing here at least here in the United States that's coming up. >> And so it almost begs a question of then what what does humane migration policy look like? What does it look like for someone to um for nations to implement this in a way that uh is actually is not uh cruel and is is uh thoughtful about what it means for the individual and how it benefits the community. Um and and how could we usefully do this at scale? Um Zeke, what do you think? >> Yeah, I I think that the the good news here is that we can have our moral cake and eat it too. That is we can do what's morally right and humane um and do what's good for us, right? In in this case, morality and self-interest are are aligned. And so, uh, because of that, I would say that we want to build policies around our self-interest. Think about what you want for a successful community, for a successful country, right? You you want uh a vibrant labor market. You want a lot of innovation. You want people that bring in, you know, healthy bodies, uh, like Sonia was saying earlier. And so, I think that we we have to start with the reality that we need more immigrants. At least most countries do. Right. Um and so we could double or triple the number of immigrants that we allow uh and we would be fine. In fact, we would we would increase economic prosperity and job creation because of that. Um increasing the flows. It turns out we don't need to do too much in terms of spending our public coffers on providing benefits. A lot of European countries uh have the fallacy that the only humane or proper way to welcome immigrants is to spend a lot of money on housing and language lessons and put them all in the same neighborhood. And actually that kind of backfires because immigrants become kind of coddled and isolated instead of just naturally interacting with their neighbors. And so in an interesting way we have to sort of get out of the way. The one thing we do have to do deliberately though is build infrastructure, right? So building housing, building roads, uh uh you know building building up in big cities uh rather than having very restrictive zoning laws. So I would say actually that housing and infrastructure development are like the policies I would focus on rather than immigration policy per se if that makes sense. Right? If you let people flow um uh and we need to increase the quotas compared to what we have now, focus on infrastructure policy. That's the one kind of active area that I would focus on. But we don't need to do too much in terms of to manipulate what people do because people will do what they do which is which is in in their quest for survival in a good life. They will bring good stuff uh for their neighbors. Um uh the other thing is that we also want to give responsibility for immigration to agencies that frame immigration positively. uh uh you know and with apologies to our non- US uh listeners and viewers here just to give an example from the US just because it's a country I live in isn't it so telling that in the United States we have put the department of homeland security in charge of our immigration apparatus right the agency that is t tasked with protecting you from external threats so that itself tells you that we have framed immigration all wrong imagine if we gave responsibility to department of commerce department of labor right these are entities that are tasked task with developing policies and rules that are about uh human prosperity rather than just sort of safety and barriers. Uh that would be a very different framing than what we have right now. >> And I'd love to hear your thoughts on this too, Sonia. And also um if there are examples you can share of spaces that uh where you have seen implementing sort of these humane u migration policies similar to what Zeik has suggested or proposed for the United States. Yeah, I mean I think there's a lot we can do to kind of think about absorptive capacity. Um where are there places where we need more people? Um where are there places where there's enough housing to accommodate people quickly, enough jobs, enough schools, enough, you know, all of those things. We can we can kind of evaluate places in that way and we can encourage our migrants to go to those places. I mean some of it happens naturally like Zeke says because it's in migrants interests themselves to go to those places but sometimes it doesn't and you know we policy makers could address that uh we could make uh migration safe humane and dignified by giving people papers by giving people legal channels if they had more legal channels to move then they wouldn't move in disaster circumstances they wouldn't move all at once in the most disruptive way possible to the mo the closest place that they can get to as opposed to maybe somewhere else which would make more sense and would have more absorptive capacity. These are all things that could be evaluated by policy makers and incentives could be put into place to you know to to move migration in ways that we will capitalize on the benefits and minimize the disruptions. Um I think uh you know the UN has come up with a lot of great ideas on how to do this. There's a global compact on migration that several countries have signed. This is not rocket science. This is like basic policym but like Zeke said we have to change the way we think about migration and I think you know economically yes we can think about it instrumentally like do we need do we need migrants yes we do let's get let's turn the faucet on but I think we can even go deeper than that and just say migration is part of how we are resilient that is part of how we have diversity and innovation and it is a it is a deep human impulse and it's not going anywhere so let's just just adapt to it. Let's just you know the same way we have children and adapt to that even though it is hugely disruptive to have children it's an investment in the future we do it anyway. >> Yeah. And if I if I may add just a quick thought to that I mean I know I talk economics a lot and and uh but there's another aspect. Think of security national security right everyone wants national security. Uh im immigration is a great source of national security for a variety of reasons. One of them is that it creates bilateral relationships and goodwill across countries. And so countries that share a lot of immigrants and movement of people are much less likely to go to war with each other because they understand each other better because u from the grassroots you get just more natural relationships and linkages across places. The other way in which immigrants make us safer is that they have relatively low crime rates and so they make individual local communities safer. Uh and the other thing is that immigrants because of the innovations they bring are often the sources of technological improvements that increase security for countries as well. And so it's not just economics, it's not just uh ecology, it's also just uh safety, right? Which is which is turning the message completely on its head because so much of the villain message is that immigrants are a safety threat when they're exactly the opposite. Well, I I feel like the big goal with this conversation was to really um understand how we can thrive in a world where people are on the move, where it it is happening, whether um you support the ways it's happening or you don't or support the idea of immigration or don't. Um, and I guess as we're winding down the conversation, I'd love to hear from both of you, just what you you feel like is the the big thing that we're not saying or not seeing uh in in the media uh in the way migration is being portrayed or talked about um that you think we're missing in this moment? What what is the thing that um we should be talking about uh that we're we're not saying enough? Uh so Sonia, maybe we'll start with you. Yeah. I mean, I think we need to turn the whole conversation around, which is don't talk about migration at all. Talk about the problem of people being trapped. When people are trapped in places, we are all suffering in a lot of different ways. We're not getting the innovation. We're we're making people more vulnerable to climate catastrophes. We're not getting the diversity. We're not getting the the new workers we need. All those things, right? So let's talk about let's report on all the terrible things that happen when people are trapped when people cannot move. Right? So that's a new way to get at this question instead of focusing on let's look at the migrants. Are they are they good? Are they bad? Are they are they gang members or are they going to take our jobs or are they actually nice people? Let's judge them. No, forget about that. Let's look at a whole different problem which is what happens when people cannot migrate. go to those places where people are trapped, where people want to move, and see what is happening there. That is a completely under reportported story. And that that really gets to the heart of what Zeke and I are both talking about. The people being trapped in a place is much worse than letting them move around. >> Yeah. I mean, that's really, really well said. Um, you know, I hope I can I can add to that. But related to that, I think that look, I spend a reasonable amount of time speaking to journalists and to the media. I think they're they're doing the job the best they can. But unfortunately, we as consumers of media love sensational stories, right? And so so the story of some disorder at some border will get eyeballs. But the story of, hey, regular everyday migrant goes to work, pays taxes, contributes to their community, is a good person, helps a little lady cross the street, that doesn't make the headlines. But in reality, like the vast majority of immigration is just that, everyday people doing the right thing. And also the vast majority of immigration is orderly and regular and not chaotic. And so I think that unfortunately because of the incentives that the media has because of what we consume, there's this very distorted reporting of the kinds of immigration that happens and and and what it does. So that would be number one is just find a way to report the average everyday normal things that migrants do, just like normal people do. Second is that we're too obsessed with how people arrive at our borders and not obsessed enough with what they do once they're inside. And once you understand what they do what when they're inside, which is overwhelmingly good, it's much easier to have conversations about how to manage the arrival process. The problem is we get it exactly backwards. We obsess so much about how they arrive, we never talk about what they do. Uh and then the third is, you know, stop with the villain and victim dichotomy. Focus on how immigrants are good for us. And again, then the conversation is much easier to have. I think if we do those three things, uh, we can, I think, pretty quickly come to an agreement and and we'll be much more sane about how we deal with this issue. >> Well, I want to thank you both so much for sharing all of your insight and and thoughts on this. I I definitely learned a lot during this conversation and um have taken in so much um about how I think about this topic and I I hope that everyone um watching um will also has also gained something from this. Um so," thank you. Thank you both. >> Thank you. >> Thank you. This is really fun. >> It's a pleasure to be here.""",unknown
gN07gbipMoY,"Five years ago, I was a prisoner in my own life. I was hopelessly addicted to drugs. Every morning I would get up, go buy drugs, and then spend the rest of the day using, barely conscious, until I passed out again
at the end of the night. I spent months at a time like that. I don't have a lot of memories
from that time, but one thing I do remember very clearly is this incredible sense
of awe and resentment I felt just watching normal people
do normal things. I would see somebody
meeting a friend for lunch, and it would seem inconceivable to me that anybody could be that free. They could just decide
what to do with an afternoon. This talk isn't about addiction per se, but I'm telling you this
because I really need you to understand where I'm coming from, how trapped I was, before I tell you that my life
is amazing now. I'm clean, first and foremost. (Applause) I'm married to an incredible man, and we get to do all sorts
of fun projects together. And I'm CEO of Astera Institute, a multibillion dollar private foundation that's pioneering a new approach to supporting innovative
science and technology. (Applause) What I do want to talk about today is how I got from point A to point B. What changed? It's not that I got smarter
or that I started trying harder. I think what changed was even
more fundamental. It was developing a sense
of personal agency, which I think about as the capacity
to both see and act on all of the degrees of freedom
we actually have. It's about being able to find
the hidden doors in the walls of life. I want to argue that when it comes to living
a satisfying and meaningful life, agency is actually much more important than the things we usually
think about as critical to success, like intelligence and hard work, both of which are next
to useless if misapplied, and which are becoming
less and less important as we increasingly
outsource them to machines. I saw a quote recently from Garry Tan,
the CEO of Y Combinator, that I really liked. He said, ""Intelligence is on tap now, so agency is even more important."" For all of the freedom
that addiction took from me, I think it actually gave
me an unnatural advantage when it came to cultivating agency. And that's because while
agency has many mothers, one of them is certainly desperation. Addicts call this the gift
of desperation, actually. The willingness to do
whatever it takes to change your life, to embarrass yourself by standing up
in front of a roomful of strangers and say, “My name is Cate,
and I’m a drug addict.” Or to lock yourself away for months. Or to take medications
that will put you in the ER if you drink. By the time I went to rehab, I definitely had the gift of desperation. I lost my job, most of my friends. For a time, I'd basically
lost the ability to walk. And so when I left,
I walked into a halfway house and a complete mess of a life. But in a way, I think
that was actually good. Because I felt like I had
nothing left to lose. And that made me fearless and hungry. I started saying yes to everything, every connection
someone was willing to make in hopes it might lead to something
that would help me get back on my feet. I remember just going for volume. It didn't matter if I could tell
how something would benefit me. That's how I ended up meeting
most of the people I've worked with in the last four years. Losing my sense of pride
also helped me learn really fast. I had brain damage, which meant that I didn't
always understand things, and I couldn't pretend that I did either. So I got good at saying,
""I don't understand what you just said. Can you explain it to me?"" in situations where before
I might have just nodded along. Side note: people love to explain things. (Laughter) It's a total win win. Now I have great news, which is that you don't need
to ruin your life and then rebuild it in order to learn to be more agentic. I do think it helps
to be some kind of desperate, but there's always something
to be desperate for. I felt that during COVID, as friends and I watched low-income
countries struggle with vaccinations because they lacked
adequate cold chain storage. So we created a company
that created a shelf-stable vaccine, and we let that desperation drive us
into clinical trials in under six months, faster than any start-up in history. I felt another kind of desperation
early on in my marriage, when it seemed like there was
an invisible wall between the two of us. So in desperation, I learned how to resolve
the emotional barriers that made it difficult for me
to connect with people. I don't think agency is innate. But I do think most people
learn it through sheer luck. If it's not the luck of desperation, then maybe it's just the luck
of seeing somebody highly agentic operating up close. I also think, though, that it can be learned systematically
and by many more people. I want to share some of the tactics
I've learned for becoming more agentic. First, assume everything is learnable. I gave the example of learning
to connect with my husband, but I could have just as easily spoken
from personal experience about learning to be
more optimistic or curious. I think most traits
that people treat as fixed are actually quite learnable. If you both believe that they are and put the same kind of effort
into learning them that you would anything else. Second, court rejection. We spend our lives carefully avoiding it, but if you're only aiming
for things you get you're doing yourself a disservice. In fact, sometimes you have to aim
for things that feel unreasonable to make sure your instinct
about what's reasonable is right. Last time I was applying for a job,
I told a couple people: ""I'm thinking about starting
an organization much like your own. Can I run yours instead?"" (Laughter) A little delusional, maybe. But the thing is,
sometimes delusional works. Third, seek real feedback. Pretty much every one of us
has something holding us back that we're completely blind to and that's obvious to other people. Don't you want to know what that is? The single best way to find out is to give people a way
to tell you anonymously. I know that might sound scary, it was to me at first, but it can also be exhilarating. I have an anonymous feedback box
linked to my Twitter profile, and it has honestly been life-changing, not just in terms of the specific
feedback I've gotten, but in knowing that I'm not trying
to hide things from myself anymore. If I could go back in time five years and talk to the person that I was then and tell her that I would one day
experience that kind of freedom, to not have to hide things, to do whatever I feel like
with my afternoons, to be basically happy. I would not have believed it. But that is the power of personal agency. No matter how stuck you are, if you can learn to locate
the doors hidden within you, you can unlock inconceivable
kinds of freedom. Thank you. (Applause)",unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6cJViq5lGBw,"When I was in that time, the thing that could bring like white hot fury to me was the idea that there is like every cloud has a silver lining. Yeah. Yeah. That's a trigger point for me. You know, like I would try and tell someone how absolutely horrific things were and they'd be like, ""You're going to get through this and be stronger on the other side."" And I was like, ""I could rip your jugular vein out right now. Hi, I'm Katherine May, author of Wintering and Enchantment. Let's start for people who maybe aren't familiar with your work. Can you start by explaining what wintering and enchantment are about? Sure. So, Wintering is a book about the dark seasons in life. So, it thinks about our metaphorical winters when we feel frozen out of life, out in the cold, all those words that we commonly use to describe periods of illness or disaster or or just general trouble. And it's also like a a song to winter, which is my favorite season. And then enchantment kind of follows it up in lots of ways and thinks about how we emerge from those winters and how we can reestablish contact with the world and and just begin to feel that sense of exchange between us and everything around us again when we've felt very numb and very dislocated. These books resonated so deeply with me and one of the big reasons I think is you are directly addressing a really big problem in our society I think which is that we believe that we can avoid dark and painful and difficult times and that when they happen since we think we they can be avoided we think that it's somehow our fault that we've brought them on and that they shouldn't be there and that we should keep them hidden away rather than sharing them with others. Yeah, there's a really profound belief that we fail if we winter. Whereas actually if if you think about it for just a few moments, it's entirely obvious that it's normal. You know, we can't live a whole life without having someone dear to us die. We can't live a whole life without getting sick. We rarely get to live a whole life without losing a job, for example. I mean there there are so many different things that can happen and yet quite often when we see them happen to other people we do this little trick of the mind that that says okay so why is that their fault like what would I have done differently and I still catch myself doing it and that you know it's protective isn't it like we just don't want to think that that kind of horror is possible but then of course when it visits us we are left with no toolkit to process what's happening. And of course, guilt is inevitably the thing that comes up first of all because we we do seem to be like a very guiltladen species in the first place. Um and we we don't allow ourselves any other exit route really. I want to read a few quotes from from wintering here. Towards the beginning, you write, ""However it arrives, wintering is usually involuntary, lonely, and deeply painful. Yet, it's also inevitable. We like to imagine that it's possible for life to be one eternal summer and that we have uniquely failed to achieve that for ourselves. A few pages later, you write, ""In our relentlessly busy contemporary world, we are forever trying to defer the onset of winter. We don't ever dare to feel its full bite, and we don't dare to show the way it ravages us. An occasional sharp wintering would do us good. We must stop believing that these times in our lives are somehow silly, a failure of nerve, a lack of willpower. We must stop trying to ignore them or dispose of them. They are real and they're asking something of us. We must learn to invite the winter in. We may never choose to winter, but we can choose how. I was so struck especially by this last line there. We may never choose to winter, but we can choose how. I wonder if I can just get you to talk a little bit more about that. Yeah, I mean, we can't push that phrase too far because obviously like if we got to choose how, we would tend to rush it through actually. Like, you know, this time in life is vile and I want it over with. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But what we can do is enter this path of radical acceptance and know that actually winter is like necessary change arriving. Not welcome change but necessary change. And what that means is that we can allow ourselves to be mindful through that process to notice everything that's happening to ask what's going on to try and find a way to stop resisting it because as Alan Watts says like a lot of the the pain that we experience is the running from the pain that that is the kind of very definition of pain. Um, and instead we can begin to think, okay, I'm going through a fundamentally human process here, and when I come out the other side of it, which I will on some level, I will have gained in like wisdom and the rich experience of the world. And we need to learn to do that without saying and I can avoid suffering in the process because that just isn't part of the deal. I think this is the kind of conversation where it actually really helps sometimes to be specific and personal. So, just to share a a particularly dark winter for me was my wife had gotten very ill mysteriously with injuries and chronic pain and it had led to her essentially not being able to take care of herself. It felt to me as a person who loved her like things were getting so bad so fast and past a point that I knew that things could ever get bad. And I felt for me this sense that I was working as hard as I possibly could, trying so hard and it was essentially doing nothing. Like I was barely keeping the wheels on, but the things were just getting worse and worse and worse. It's that kind of treading water thing and you're getting more and more exhausted and nothing and you're just actually losing ground. Yeah. Yeah. The metaphor I used quite frequently was that I am using 100% of my effort to just keep us both from drowning, but we are not making any progress. You know, fortunately, that is not where we're at anymore. Um, and so one of the things that really resonates with me about the metaphor you choose of winter is that it's a season. It doesn't mean that it's a short season. When I was in that time, the thing that could bring like white hot fury to me was the idea that there is like every cloud has a silver lining. Yeah. Yeah. That's a trigger point for me. You know, like I would try and tell someone how absolutely horrific things were and they'd be like, ""You're going to get through this and be stronger in the other side."" I was like, ""I could rip your jugular vein out right now."" Oh, Chris, I have to tell you, you know, having spent the last 5 years talking about wintering, um, we are in my family currently dealing with a very new winter. My husband got a cancer diagnosis two weeks ago and that is a very live issue for us right now. The number of people who who just can't go there and like all I need right now is for people to say, ""God, that's awful. I'm so sorry."" Like I don't I need no more than that. Like if they want to make me a cup of coffee alongside that, I'm delighted with with any help I can get. Cuz as you say, like it illness is exhausting for everybody in the household. you know, least of all the person who's actually sick. But I'm hearing everybody's kind of cancer fears coming up for at me at the moment. Um, and they're not relating to what we're going through. And instead, actually, what people want to say is, ""Oh, it's fine. He'll get better. Loads of people get better."" Mhm. And yes, that's really true. And, you know, prognosis is so much better than it used to be. And medical medical technology is extraordinary. And you know, we're doing everything we can, but actually we need to develop safe spaces in this world to say, ""Oh, that's scary, isn't it?"" You know, or wow, that that uncertainty must be hard to deal with rather than kind of jumping to hang on in there. You'll you'll be able to tough it out. You know, this is going to be fine. Um it's just not true. It's not true. And we are intelligent people and we need to have better conversations with each other than this. We deserve it. Yeah. I I think it really does reveal the lie in some of the cliches that we want to believe, right? Like what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. And I'm like many things that don't kill you actually leave you much weaker. Yeah. Yeah. And also I mean having again like having had these conversations for many years, people say and of course um you'll come out better. And actually, the truth is, no, no, no, no, no. You won't necessarily. Like, sometimes when we're wintering, we're processing a decline or a loss. And life won't be better afterwards necessarily. And the and the horrible truth behind all of that is that we will all at some point in our lives face a decline. However, that doesn't make our lives worthless. And it doesn't mean we can't come to terms with it. And it doesn't mean that we can't live a beautiful and full and rich human existence within that difficulty. But the thing that I think is so important about the message that you're delivering is not you're going to be better or it's all going to be okay. It is you are not alone. Yeah. You're not the only person who's ever experienced this. I understand. That is actually the important message and that is the message that you're delivering. So that's why I really feel like it is the perfect messenger and it is possible to experience your pain and come out the other side of it. That is that's not an impossible feat. I mean at the moment the world seems so dark. So much is happening that is so utterly terrifying. And I just think we we need we need this ability right now to say, ""Oh god, that is hitting me right in the chest. This is this is agony. This is awful. I am in pain. Okay. Yeah. That's how we look each other in the eye then, isn't it? That's that is the stuff that we've got in common. You have this beautiful quote towards the end of of wintering where you're talking about Alan Watt saying in the wisdom of insecurity. He says to hold your breath is to lose your breath. And then you you explain that um the case that he's making is that life is by its very nature uncontrollable. that we should stop trying to finalize our comfort and security and instead find a radical acceptance of the endless unpredictable change that is the very essence of this life. Our suffering, he says, comes from the fight we put up against this fundamental truth. Yeah, we create the suffering. Well, maybe not entirely, but we certainly make it way, way worse because we do everything we can to get around the suffering. You know, it's almost like you get a thorn in your hand and your body swells around it. That's what we do around our pain. Instead of actually allowing oursel to perceive the thorn, we we will do anything to avoid feeling it. You know, in some cases turn to drugs or alcohol. We will keep so busy we can't think straight. We will seek out solutions that we know won't work. Like we we will just run and run and run and run and run. And the problem is at some point we are stopped. We run out of energy. We run out of options. Like there the world just says enough. Come on. That's it now. And it's like taking a drunk person home. You know, there's there's this interesting phenomenon which is that uh some form of art can sometimes really speak to you in a way that other things can't. I mean this the classic is to listen to a breakup song. But but for some people it's going to the movies or watching a comedy special or looking at art or um making art. Again, just speaking for myself, one of the really interesting sensations of being in these moments of intense emotion is I have felt like my outer layer of skin is completely removed and I just feel everything and it's overwhelming and impossible to live like that forever. But there's this moment where it just everything is so intense. Again, without saying like there's a gift or this is a good thing, but that is quite an interesting and different way of experiencing the world. And I think it's very tied towards art and the experiencing and the making of art is to to feel every emotion to be able to cry so easily to be able to laugh with wild abandon to to have these feelings run through you at a 10 immediately rather than the three or four that they might be at in in a a different moment in your life. Yeah. I mean, it's a complicated gift, but it is actually a strange gift that we're that we're given at these points because as well as being alive to pain, we are so alive to beauty in these moments. And just the tiniest tiniest thing can just feel transcendent for a few moments. And I I do think that one of the one of the factors of a wintering that we ignore is how emotionally varied they are. You know, like we we come away remembering the sadness and the misery and the struggle, but when you look at it moment by moment, what we're actually experiencing is like super intense emotions all all the way through. And you know, people's kindness to us right now is so moving. When someone's sick, you often end up like remodeling the bathroom so they can get in and out of the shower and things like that. Like as if everything else isn't on your plate. That's that's where we are right now. And I had a pallet of tiles delivered yesterday and I was already like dreading it, you know? I was just thinking, I've got to carry all these damn tiles in on my own, you know, like it's all I could think about all day. The pallet arrived, I picked up the first box, carried it into my house, and as I was coming out of my front door to get the next box, my neighbor was already carrying a box in like he had seen it out the window and he just came out to help. He didn't ask. He didn't need me to ask. And I was so moved by that. That's the beauty that you begin to see is that people are looking for a way to help. And it was it was a little bit of magic, honestly. Like I really I really kind of thought I never want to forget how beautiful it was just for someone to to just know that you'd be struggling with that and to just pop out of their house and carry stuff in for you. It's so much better when you experience that kindness from others, the companionship of others. And yet, I think most commonly people say, ""Catherine, I'm so sorry to hear this is going on. Let me know if there's anything I can do to help."" And that's very very well-intentioned almost impossible to take to take them up on that. So, how do you how how does one and how are you leaving yourself open to those moments of absolutely necessary vital kindness without having to text all the people who have texted you back and say, ""Could you come and help me move these pallets, which just feels impossible to do?"" I've reflected on this a lot because I think that we're all happier giving care than receiving it essentially. you know, we see the state of needing care as a kind of humiliation or a weakness and and yet like we are in need of care right now. And so I've been disciplining myself when people say how are things into kind of if it's the right person like not not just any any person but the people that I'm actually close to who do who I know really care saying things are really rough today actually like just practicing that sentence and not defaulting to the stuff I want to say with like yeah we're all right we're we're going through it step by step you know people ask how my son is and you know my default is like oh he's fine he's not fine but none of us are fine and so actually like opening up that pathway to let people help is in a weird way a way of being generous to other people because they do they do want to help and so yeah I've started started to say practical things like you know could you maybe come around and just play cards with with someone this afternoon like or you know if you're free everyone would love some company honestly. Um or if people come around, I always now say, ""Can you just give me a hand with the washing up before you go?"" Because I've just done so much of it lately. Nobody minds. Nobody minds. And and it's a way of communicating that I'm exhausted. I'm at the end of my tether and I could actually do with a little care. Like it it's okay to need a little care. And I know that I have given care to all of those people in the past and very gladly. And it's it's letting them in. It's giving them a little crack that they can just, you know, just glimpse what you're going through and and do something. I often feel like people are very well set up to understand and care and help you if it is a clear acute problem. my foot is broken and the cast will be off in three weeks. People 100% know what to do and they're so comfortable with that. It's much harder when it's I'm in pain and no one understands why and it's been 4 months and it might be 4 years. At a certain point, people seem to say, ""Well, that's just your deal. I don't want to hear about it anymore."" Yeah, that's how it goes. Uh there's a book called The Wounded Storyteller. I don't know if you've ever come across it, but that book makes the point that the illness is a narrative experience essentially. There are loads of different narratives that can come from it, but one of the key narratives is chaos. Like we are rarely given in our illnesses a very simple beginning, middle, and end story. You know, the hero's journey doesn't doesn't often really apply to illness. It's often random, chaotic. it goes here and there. We think we're getting better and then we're not. You know, acknowledging those more more chaotic narratives is so so tough. I mean, we, you know, my husband's been sick for like nearly 6 months now. And it's really interesting seeing people's reaction to the diagnosis cuz it's not changing anything materially about how he feels and what he's able to do. This sounds so bitter and I don't mean it to, but like now people are offering help that we've needed all along honestly. Um, but it's just so much easier for us as humans to process a name. And for some illnesses, people don't get a name for it forever or for years or they get a really unsatisfying name for it that doesn't it feel like it even nearly covers it and there's no treatment plan and there's no cure. You know, we we find it very very hard to conceptualize the vast majority of illnesses. For people who aren't familiar with the um the hero's journey or the the narrative arc, can you just give us a little bit of a a brief understanding of that? It's the idea that the kind of traditional story um contains a hero who is who goes through a series of tests um and who essentially like there's there's always a kind of moment of doubt and refusal of the mission, but ultimately they triumph. I mean that's the that's the kind of the very very compact form of it. Um, my lectures were always often about how problematic that is like and how it often represents, you know, a sort of imagined male lifestyle rather than the heroine. Um, but also how kind of boring that story gets. You know, I I spend a lot of time annoying my family going, ""Right, just pause the film now. I'm going to tell you what's going to happen next."" Because once you once you have a a sort of a knowledge of that hero's journey, films become very very predictable. Like the good old Hollywood movie is like, ""Oh, yeah, they're about to get separated."" You know, and everyone's like, ""Oh, come on. Why do you have to do this?"" It's like, ""For smug reasons is why I have to do it."" Yes. Those are some of the best reasons I believe in life. Listen, you got to take what you can get in this life. The truth is that real life journeys, real life narrative arcs are rarely like that very heroic narrative and we rarely get this moment of simple triumph, you know, that we might be led to expect that that we can hope for. Um, and in fact, the gifts are more complicated than that. I always like John York's book about storytelling called Into the Woods. Um, if you if you're going to study narrative, that's my favorite because he says that a story, and I'm about to badly misquote him, but is the process of going into the woods and bringing something back for your home. The journey is there, but the the the gift that you bring back is complex and not necessarily what you expected to get, but it it does sit right in the middle of of your existence. I love that. Also, uh, when I was, you know, when I was trying to to process all of the the things that had happened to to us and figure things out, I talked to my friend Emma, who's a quite brilliant therapist. And um, she was just asking me very kindly how things were and where we were at. And uh, I things were kind of stabilizing. I think that was true. It was stabilizing. And I said, I think that we we might be out of the woods. And uh something that she said that I've thought about so many times, even when we're not in hard times, is she said, ""I don't think that you ever leave the woods. You just go to nicer or less nice parts of the woods."" But you're always in the woods. And also, the woods are great. Like, let's not diss the woods either. I mean, this is the this is the thing. People pay a lot of money to get to a cabin in the woods. I love the woods. Um yeah, it's that I mean, I always Oh, I'm about to quote Shakespeare. I do apologize, but like I always think about full fathom five from the tempest. You know, full fathom five, thy father lies of his bones are corals made. They once were pearls that are his eyes. None of them that do fade but to suffer a sea change into something rich and strange. And at times like this, that's the poem that goes through my mind because this it's about transformation and it's about something odd coming out of it quite often, but there's a richness to that existence and we we can't just discard the richness of that because it really does take us to the core of of of being a a person. I think I love that. It's also um you you fulfilled the dream of any American speaking to anyone from the UK is that somehow somehow they would quote Shakespeare to us. I'm a little bit embarrassed. I'm sorry. That's just that's what rolls through my head right now. Yeah, don't worry. I'll I'll reference something in Texas and say ye-haw later on. So, we'll we'll both have fulfilled our duties. I appreciate that. That would be really nice. Thanks. Absolutely necessary. Um there's a a moment in um another moment in wintering where you're you're talking to a f to a friend and she's telling you that um a her doctor has essentially said to her that um this isn't about getting you fixed. It's about living the best life you can with the parameters that you have. And I think that's something that people don't often think about, right? It's always like this hero's journey is about like you get back to better than you ever were before. It's all resolved. And the real life version of this is sometimes not that it's fixed. It's sometimes that how can you still have a a good and meaningful and purposeful life. Absolutely. That was daughter who had lived for years with bipolar. And what what's really fascinating about that was that having for years tried all these different treatments and therapies and approaches and nothing had worked and she was left with this kind of increasing sense of desolation about what she could possibly be going forward. Um, it was having a doctor that was brave enough to say to her, ""This might be as good as it gets."" Like, ""How do you adapt to this life? This this life that you've been given."" That was this point at which her life suddenly got way better because she then started to genuinely adapt. I talked to her in the book about her cold swimming. Um, which I mean, I love swimming in cold water, but she really really loves swimming in cold water. Um, and it but it's how she learned to actually make herself happy rather than to ask other people to make her happy. And I think that fascinated me that that it was by absorbing the truth that did that for her rather than anything else. You know, we talk so much about hope. Like I don't concern myself with hope. I concern myself with dealing with what's in front of me. Honestly, I I could talk to you about wintering for days and not run out of things to talk about, but I do want to also talk about enchantment. Can you tell me a little bit about like the question that enchantment was answering and then how you've answered that question? I think probably two questions. One is, you know, what happens next? Like what's the dot dot dot after a wintering? Because I began at the end of the book to deal with the idea of Thor. Um, but how does that actually look? And how do we come back even more connected like even feeling that stuff even more deeply? Like how do we not lose those insights that have began to grow in us during a wintering? But I think on a personal level for me, I was writing Enchantment in the middle of lockdowns, like successive lockdowns, and just thinking, you know, what can I say now about this world that is so unpredictable and that really feels like the pot is being stirred. You know, I didn't know what life was going to look like when this book landed. you write a book and it's more than a year until it comes out and and at that point it felt could have been anything and it actually still does like I it has that that sense of enormous change has carried on I think really and I I was looking for what I could say that would carry on working whatever was happening and that's what drew me to think about not the big stuff but actually the small and the local and the personal and and like looking in your own backyard for wonder rather than going out and finding it on a special expedition or or whatever it is we think we need to do these days. You know, I I think that I actually really struggled after my own winter to think like how do I reconcile the comedy with the lessons of the wintering. I think that I really came to find that like for me I can hold all of that. I can hold the things that I learned and experience this delight, this enchantment, right, with looking at the world and seeing the absurdity and not denying the hard parts, but realizing that like for me, laughter and humor is the way that you release the tension and continue doing that necessary work that has the A that leads to B that leads to C that has to get done so that you can just survive. For me, this is that's my answer. Yeah, that makes loads of sense to me. I mean, I we have this weird idea that serious things are not funny. And I I actually think that the most serious things are often the most funny. 100% agree, you know, and I'm a I'm such a believer in Gallow's humor. Like I think it is this amazing human function that we have to that helps us to cope. I never believe in any story that has no humor in it. You know, like people don't I don't know. People don't deal with things dead pan. They deal with things by making terrible jokes. Like that's definitely the way I cope with everything. But there's been a lot of lung cancer jokes in my house lately. Um they would not be appropriate for anyone outside our living room, but um but they're very they're really important to us. We need we need it because we it's how you it's how you like acclimatize yourself to the language. you try stuff out, you know, and every now and then one of us will crack a joke that goes a bit far and we'll be like bit like too soon. But that's really important, too. We we really we're really needing those jokes right now. And that I think is such an important piece, right? It's not like everyone should be able to make you laugh about your thing. It's that you should be able to find your people and laugh together. Definitely. Definitely. And and actually making jokes allows you to voice the otherwise unvoicable, to voice the really grim parts of your experience because it's so hard to get those words out, you know, and a and a offcolor joke will deliver it. And laughter is a is a release of tension and emotion as well, of course, which I it's a it's a release of strong feeling. Other than humor, what are some other forms of enchantment that people can find um when they're trying to come out of these times? Yeah, I mean I I structured the book after a long long long writing journey. I ended up structuring the book around the elements, the classical elements, earth, water, fire, and air. That's actually quite a good a kind of good guide like how can you make contact with what those things mean to you? I think one of the simplest is Earth. Like I I there's a chapter about taking off your shoes and just touching the ground with bare feet and how, you know, we all do that when we hit a beach, you know, cuz we don't want sand in our shoes. But actually, we forget to do that at other times. And I like one of the simplest I kicked off my shoes as I'm speaking now. It's irresistible. Um, one of the simplest ways that you can just make contact with the actual earth again and join yourself to the the planet that is supporting you all the time is just taking off your shoes. Your feet are so sensitive. We have all these opportunities around us to just make contact. We don't have to load it with loads of meaning. We don't have to have a guru to show us how to do it. We don't have to have like a text to explain it. you can just rely on the feedback of your own senses and and for me that's such an important insight and I get so far away from that so often before I just think walk barefoot around the garden again for 5 minutes you you will feel better also the experience of being in contact with water is always transformative even if sometimes it's just plunging your feet into a bowl of water you know at the end of a long day baths showers swimming going out in the rain, you know, all of those things. Different people will love different parts of that, but water always makes you think about fluidity. It has to. Um, and it also is a is a like a profoundly temperature changing experience as well. It makes me think that I was visiting some some friends who live in um Austin, Texas, and I I jumped into this body of water there, Barton Springs, this public body of water. It's cold and it felt incredible and I popped out and I just went yee-haw. U you promised your yee-haw baby. I promised I'd do it for you. So there you go. Now we can end the podcast. Uh Katherine May, what a what an absolute delight it has been to talk to you. Thank you for your work and for your time and for your gifts. Um I really appreciate it. It's been lovely. And thank you for the yee-haw at the end. I just love that. [Music] Hi everyone. I hope you enjoyed this episode of How to be a better human.

y0xn1C6ALvo,"This is inner Mongolia, Gobi Desert. My favorite place. It's the most Mars-like on the planet. Barren and empty. Wind blows all year round. Sandstorms happen often. In the winter, temperature is as low as minus 40 degrees. In the summer, it reaches 40 degrees. It's useless. (Laughter) But it's my most favorite place. If you look at that small dot, it's me. (Laughter) I come to Gobi with a belief. I believe this could be
the new space for our civilization. When people see uselessness, barrenness, emptiness, I see abundance. Abundance. If you look at the barren desert, it is filled up with abundant
renewable energy. The strong wind and the shining sun. They are infinite and never end. I found out the important equation
between energy and our prosperity. Two thousand years
before industrial revolution, our global GDP only grew five times. Why? Because we are only able
to use five times energy. Natural energy, agriculture,
then transfer to muscle power. Since Industrial Revolution, our global GDP expanded 100 times because we are using
100 times more energy. So abundant fossil fuel
energy has been turned and created forces to drive the machines. Created materials like steel, created fertilizer to improve the food production. Today it's even creating
tremendous intelligence for humanity. So how can we unlock such
a big potential from desert, to push humanity
to the next level of prosperity? Because one hour of solar radiation is able to meet our entire
annual demand for energy. It is free, and it is green. In front of Gobi, we have to solve three challenges. The first one. How can we capture the rough
and raw wind energy? Just as steam engine is able to turn coal energy into motion, we end up with wind turbine to capture
wind energy to turn into electricity. Most importantly is to really
design the wind turbine [to be] able to survive
in the extreme wind condition in the desert. Secondly, how can we [avoid building] 
a long-distance, or thousands of miles
of transmission lines, which is costly and extremely expensive? We end up with the largest
off-grid renewable system by integrating wind turbine,
solar panel, storage with AI orchestrations. OK, then the last remaining challenge. How can we utilize such abundant, locally-made electricity? We end up with a solution
to build net-zero industrial park, which is going to produce
energy-intensive products like batteries and the green hydrogen and ammonia,
those green molecules. Why green ammonia? One ton of green ammonia is able to hold 10,000
kilowatt hours of electricity. Most importantly, the green molecule
is so important for us to decarbonize our economic system. It’s the most difficult,
hard to abate segment. The green hydrogen is going
to be used to make green steel, to make net-zero chemicals, to make green aviation and shipping. So what about today? Just right in the heart of Gobi desert, the first net-zero
industrial park has been built. It is totally off grid. 100 percent by renewable energy. It is making the state-of-the-art battery. But most importantly, it is the lowest cost of battery among all envisioned production base. Why? Because it's tremendous -- (Applause) Free, abundant renewable energy. And we are also building, in the desert, the largest green-hydrogen
project in the world, 1.5 million ton green hydrogen
and green ammonia. The first phase, 300,000 tons, as you see, is commissioning now. We are not supposed to build the largest. Our goal is to make the cheapest. To make green hydrogen as cheap as grid. Why [is the] cost so vital? Because, history told us, this 100 times energy growth is the result of cost reductions. In order to unlock
these tremendous renewables, we have to make renewable
energy much lower than fossil fuels. There are two forms of energy. One is electron, one is molecule. Today, renewable has already
won the battle against electricity. So renewable energy is much
lower on making electricity. But there's still another battle. Green molecule is about two
or three times [more] expensive than gray molecule from coal and gas. We have to make as cheap as possible, have this cost parity to the grid. So we should redesign
the entire energy system and redesign the equipment, then reduce the cost significantly. So first we designed AI-regulated wind turbine which is able to capture more energy while reducing cost significantly. We are also designing the world's
first hybrid energy storage system by combining lithium battery
with supercapacitor, [which] is able to support the grid
with much less cost. And we are improving
the efficiency of electrolyzer by innovating membranes and electrodes significantly. In order to make the construction work
in the desert much easier, much cheaper, we designed modular,
prefabricated hydrogen plant. Which has made construction
work in the desert as easy as stacking LEGO. And we are also developing
AI physical model, starting from predicting weather, wind and solar, to manage grid automatically. So today, we already are achieving the lowest
cost of green hydrogen and green ammonia in the world. But there are still some gaps. I believe within three years, by 2028, we are able to make
such cost parity to grid. Why am I so convinced? If you look at the last 20 years, the cost of wind and solar
have been reduced 90 percent. For the last five years, the cost of energy storage
has been reduced 90 percent. End of the day, green electricity [will] still be
the majority cost of green hydrogen. So by combining the significant
improvement on the electrolyzer and hydrogen factory, we are for sure to achieve
such a cost parity. By the time we achieve cost parity to grid for molecules, it is going to be a milestone
for our humanity because we are going
to remove the last bottleneck which is preventing us to unlock
tremendous renewable energy. It's the last bottleneck. It is going to open the gate to tremendous new possibilities. Just imagine, as we repeated in the history, within the next 100 years, if we are able to use
100 times more energy, how the world will look like. We are going to harvest
the superintelligence with AI data centers everywhere. We are going to desalinate seawater and turn the desert into green oasis. We are going to remove poverty
by producing our food and protein in the basement. We are going, for sure,
to reverse climate crisis by taking carbon from the air and turning it into building materials. And we are even able to make
interstellar traveling as a daily routine. (Laughter) So where's the answer? The answer it just right
in the heart of the desert. From Sahara in Africa to Middle East, from Australia to Gobi, there are 100 times [more]
energy than what we need. It's infinite, green and free. It's up to our technology. So, ladies and gentlemen, this net-zero transition is not a costly burden for us. It is indeed the one and only pathway for us, for our humanity, to achieve a new, great prosperity. Thank you.

_LDAnryI0Hw,"Why does so much of the world look like this? Why do we go to work here? Why do we send our kids to schools that look like this? How did we end up in a world that looks like this? We all have this impulse to seek out joy in our surroundings. This got me thinking, where does joy come from? I saw all these patterns, round things, pops of bright color, symmetrical shapes, a sense of abundance and multiplicity. When I saw it this way, I realized that though the feeling of joy is mysterious and elusive, we can access it through tangible physical attributes. How do we bring these ideas back into the real world? So I started finding people who were doing just that. For example, this hospital designed by the Danish artist Puljarn or these schools transformed by the nonprofit Public Color. And what's interesting is that Public Color has heard from school administrators who say that attendance improves, graffiti disappears, and kids actually say they feel safer in these painted schools. color in a very primal way is a sign of life, a sign of energy. And the same is true of abundance. We evolved in a world where scarcity is dangerous and abundance meant survival. So one confettto, which happens to be the singular of confetti in case you were wondering, isn't very joyful. But multiply it and you have a handful of one of the most joyful substances on the planet. The architect Emmanuel Maro uses this idea in her work a lot. This is a nursing home she designed where she uses these multicolored spheres to create a feeling of abundance. Each moment of joy is small, but over time they add up to more than the sum of their parts. What we should be doing is embracing joy and finding ways to put ourselves in the path of it more often.",unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GZKU7TgR6IU,"When the little boy said
the emperor was naked, he wasn't telling them anything
they didn't already know. But he added to their
knowledge nonetheless. By blurting out what everyone could see within earshot of the others, he ensured that everyone knew
that everyone else knew what they knew, that everyone knew that, and so on. And that changed their
relationship with the emperor from obsequious deference to ridicule and scorn. Hans Christian Andersen's immortal story draws on a momentous logical distinction. With private knowledge, I know something, and you know it. With common knowledge, I know that fact, and you know it, but in addition, I know that you know it, and you know that I know it, and I know that you know that I know it, ad infinitum. Of course, the reason that common
knowledge is significant is that it is essential for coordination. In a classic example
from Thomas Schelling, a couple is separated
in Manhattan, incommunicado, and somehow must find each other. Well he knows that she likes
to browse the aisles of certain bookstore, so he heads there. But then he realizes that she knows that he likes to hang out
in a certain camera store, so he changes course until he figures that she will anticipate that he will guess that she will opt
for the bookstore. So he does another about face, only for it to dawn on him that it will occur to her that he knows that she is aware
that he likes to haunt the bookstore, so he pirouettes once again. Meanwhile, she is whipsawed
by the same futile empathy. Nothing short of common knowledge
can guarantee that they'll end up at the same place and at the same time. Of course, no one can think
an infinite Russian doll of “I know that she knows
that I know that she knows” thoughts. Our heads start to spin
with three or four layers, let alone an infinite number. In a well-known episode of ""Friends,"" Phoebe says to Rachel, “They don’t know we know
they know we know. Joey, you can't say anything!"" And he replies, ""I couldn't even if I wanted to!"" (Laughter) Instead, common knowledge can be captured in a simple mental intuition that something is public or conspicuous or out there, and that can be conveyed by direct speech. In the case of our separated couple,
a cell phone call. Indeed, solving coordination dilemmas
may be the reason that language evolved in our species in the first place. In the absence of a public event, the next best thing
is conspicuous salience, or a focal point. Schelling suggests that our couple
might gravitate toward the big clock in Grand Central Station, even if it wasn't particularly close to the point at which
they'd been separated, simply because each might anticipate that it would pop
into the mind of the other. A third solution is a convention. A tacit agreement
to do something in a certain way for no other reason than they
have agreed to do it that way, which is reason enough. Our separated couple might agree that should they ever be
separated in the future, they will adopt the convention of chivalry and go to the bookstore. Or patriarchy, and go to the camera store. Or whimsy, and go to a lost-and-found
in a department store. Or fairness, and take turns or flip coins. At larger scales, common salience or focal points and conventions, drive a lot of our legal
and financial coordination. An everyday example is driving
on the left, or on the right. It doesn't matter as long as everyone
agrees to drive on the same side, as in the joke about the woman who calls
her husband during his morning commute and says, ""Be careful, honey. The radio says that there's a maniac
driving on the wrong side of the freeway."" And he says, ""One maniac? There are hundreds of them."" (Laughter) Another everyday example is money. I accept a piece of paper
in exchange for an old chair, because I know that my grocer will accept it in exchange
for some groceries because he knows his supplier
will accept it, and so on. Now not all the examples
are this obvious. Why are autocrats terrified
of public protests? Well the basic reason was explained
by Gandhi in the eponymous movie when he said, ""100,000 Englishmen
cannot control 350 million Indians if the Indians refuse to cooperate."" The problem is that the Indians
can't refuse to cooperate if each one fears
that no one will join him. In a public demonstration, each protester can see
the other protesters see the other protesters, and this common knowledge allows them
to coordinate their resistance, whether by literally storming the palace or by bringing the apparatus
of the state to a halt through boycotts and work stoppages. This is the basis for a joke
from the old Soviet Union, in which a man in Red Square
is handing out leaflets to passersby. Soon enough, the KGB arrest him, only to discover that the leaflets
are blank sheets of paper. They say, ""What is the meaning of this?"" And the man says, ""What's there to say? It's so obvious."" (Laughter) The point of the joke is the man was generating
subversive common knowledge. And in a case of life imitating a joke, in recent years, Russian police have arrested
several people for holding, yes, blank signs. Another non-obvious example
comes from the world of investing. John Maynard Keynes
compared speculative investing to a newspaper beauty contest, in which the winner is not the woman
with the prettiest face but the contestant who chooses the face that is chosen by the greatest number
of other contestants, each of whom is anticipating the choices
of other contestants, and so on. This can set off cycles
of exuberant recursive mentalizing, as investors desperately
search for focal points, each one buying an investment not because of its
inherent productive value but because they hope to unload it
at a profit on future investors, greater fools. This can set everyone off
in search of conspicuous focal points such as Super Bowl ads. Everyone knows that everyone
watches the Super Bowl. In 2022, cryptocurrency exchanges
ran high-concept ads in which they tried to gin up
a common expectation of rising prices not by touting any of the advantages
of cryptocurrency but by warning, ""Don't be like Larry. Don't miss out."" Now, of course, it's only so long
that an asset can levitate in midair, suspended by nothing
but common expectation. Bubbles pop when the market
runs out of greater fools who don’t want to miss out
on the next best thing or when the doubt itself
becomes common knowledge. This can send investors
running for the exits, each desperate to sell a security out of fear that everyone else
is desperate to sell it. The result can be a bank run
or hyperinflation or a Great Depression. When Franklin Delano Roosevelt said, ""The only thing we have
to fear is fear itself,"" it was not a feel-good bromide,
but a theorem of common knowledge. With investors constantly
on the lookout for focal points, financial leaders have to be wordsmiths, mystics and occasionally, comedians. Alan Greenspan once said, ""Since I've become a central banker, I've learned to mumble
with great incoherence."" (Laughter) ""If I seem unduly clear to you, you must have misunderstood what I said."" (Laughter) After Jimmy Carter told
his inflation czar, Alfred Kahn, never to use the self-fulfilling word
""depression,"" he said, ""OK, but we're in danger of having
the biggest banana in 45 years."" (Laughter) My own interest in common
knowledge comes from its role in social relationships. A relationship is a coordination game. Two people are friends
or lovers or allies, or dominant and subordinate
or transaction partners because each one knows
the other one knows that they are. And this common knowledge
can be cemented by a number of common knowledge
generating signals. Like eye contact, where you're looking
at the part of the person that's looking at the part of you
that's looking at that part of them. Or blushing, where you feel
the heat of the cheeks, reddening of your cheeks
from the inside, knowing that other people
can see it from the outside. Or laughter, where an unignorable noise can expose the common assumptions
among everyone who gets the joke. Conversely, when we worry
about upending a relationship, we might go to great lengths
to repress common knowledge. We might avoid looking someone in the eye, or pretend to ignore
the elephant in the room or mumble with great incoherence. This is why, in everyday conversation, we often don't blurt out
what we mean in so many words, but veil our intentions
in innuendo and euphemism, counting on our listeners
to catch our drift. A classic example is the sexual come on ""Would you like to come up
and see my etchings,"" which by the 1930s was so familiar
that James Thurber could draw a cartoon in which the hapless man says to his date, ""You wait here and I'll bring
the etchings down."" A century later, etchings
has become “Netflix and chill.” (Laughter) We also veil our bribes, as in, ""Gee, officer, is there some way we might
settle the ticket here?"" And our threats, as in, ""I'm so delighted to learn that you're on the jury
of the Soprano trial. It's an important civic duty
that we should all take part in. You've got a wife and kids, we know you'll do the right thing."" The point of innuendo
is not plausible deniability because these euphemisms
don't pass the giggle test, but rather deniability
of common knowledge. If Harry says to Sally,
""Want to come up for Netflix and chill,"" and Sally turns him down, well, Sally knows she's turned down
a sexual overture, and Harry knows that Sally
has turned down a sexual overture. But does Sally know that Harry knows? She could think,
""Maybe he thinks I'm naive."" And does Harry know
that Sally knows that Harry knows? He could think,
""Maybe she thinks I'm dense."" Without the common knowledge, they can maintain the fiction
of a platonic relationship. But if Harry were to have said,
“Want to come up and have sex,” and Sally said no, well, now Harry knows that Sally knows
that Harry knows that Sally knows. With this common knowledge, they can no longer maintain the fiction
of a platonic friendship. And that's what lies behind the intuition
that with bare-faced speech, you can't take it back. It's out there. The logic of common knowledge
and social relationships explains why we all deplore the hypocrisy and white lies and role playing
of everyday social interaction, but we wouldn't want to live without them. As dystopian comedies
like ""Liar Liar"" play out. Our relationships are underpinned
by a common understanding of limitless loyalty and generosity. Privately, we know they're fictions, but making these rude realities
common knowledge would pollute the pool
of common assumptions that allow us to get along. We also have to get along
in less intimate relationships, and in those cases, we rely on norms: ways of living together that aren’t
written down by lawgivers or enforced by the police, but exist because everyone
knows they exist. In social life, basic civility depends on norms such as that you don't brazenly lie, you don't insult people to their faces, you don't prosecute personal vendettas. In the anarchic global arena, peace depends on norms
such as that nation states are immortal, national borders are grandfathered in, conquest is unacceptable, and nuclear weapons are unthinkable. These norms are propped up
by nothing but common acceptance, and so they're vulnerable to imploding
if they are overtly flouted, or even if there is loose talk
about flouting them. I hope that, having explained
the logic behind human harmony, I don't have to explain how
these norms are currently under threat or what is at stake if we lose them. As a man once said, ""What's there to say? It's so obvious."" Thank you.

oBP07G7PL-k,"Bill Heck: So ... Capitalism. Capitalism is the most powerful
prosperity-generating force ever known. Excuse me! Yes. Uh, sorry. I think you mean the most
extractive force ever known. Oh, hello. Well, it's lifted billions
of people out of poverty and expanded access to food and literacy. It basically birthed our modern world. Yeah, and in the process, it's wiped out hundreds of species
and decimated countless cultures, extracting resources faster
than anything that came before. OK. But the market is a genius
at driving innovation, giving us the freedom
to buy, sell, compete and create in ways
that make society better. Yeah, but how can you call it freedom when the most affordable
food is diabetes-inducing junk? How can it be genius, when life-saving drugs aren't fast-tracked because they don't generate enough profit? Oh, so you want to grow the pie? Well, then the name
of the game is capitalism. The game of capitalism is rigged. I mean, who cares
about the size of the pie if it's so unevenly distributed? Sweetheart, size always matters. (Laughter) And who would you have managing
our food supply or setting drug prices? Do Venezuela or North Korea
develop any life-saving drugs? Sure, capitalism has its problems,
but it solves them through innovation. Yeah, yeah, I'm all for innovation. But toward what end game? I mean, there's this paradox
where innovations in energy efficiency often make us use more total energy, which is a problem
if that energy isn't clean. Listen, the economic system in America
today isn't even true capitalism. It's a crony perversion of capitalism. But even in its imperfect form, capitalism is still humanity's
greatest champion. Try not to drop your hammer
on his toe or gut him with your sickle. (Laughs) OK. See, criticizing capitalism
does not mean pushing for socialism. It means recognizing
the fatal flaw of capitalism. In its pursuit of profit, it fails to account fully for its costs. We are in the midst
of an existential crisis when arms races are counted
as economic growth. A tree is worth more dead than alive. And people are worth more
outraged and addicted than they are conscious and free. I'm not saying that capitalism
itself is the goal, OK? It's simply our best strategy
for achieving the goal. Oh, so then what is the goal? That is a question for society,
not capitalists to answer, you oligarch! Bring it, Pinko! Whoa, whoa, whoa, fellas. What!? What!? Oh, boy, OK. (Laughter) What if you're both partially right? Look, everybody likes to pit capitalism
and socialism against each other, but most modern economies are mixed. They combine the decentralized
intelligence of the market with the stabilizing force of the state. But ultimately, most standard
economic theories suffer from the same fatal flaw. They prioritize one metric
at the expense of others. And capitalism has generated
the most overall wealth. But if it keeps
deferring costs of the future, it risks humanity's capability
to play any game at all. See, it's not just that capitalism
has its upsides and downsides, it's that its downsides are bringing us
to the brink of self-destruction. But its upsides are empowering us
to evolve beyond it. And at the end of the day,
the internet likes to put us into a box. Gives us two options: red or blue, woke or anti-woke, capitalism or socialism. Don't fall for the false trade-off. Yeah, I don't want to fall for anything. Integrate more perspectives. Yeah, I'm all for that. So then, you are both partially right. As am I. I mean, our view will forever
be inherently incomplete. But we can always strive to see more faces of the hyper dimensional shape
that is reality. Be well. (Applause) Stephanie Lepp: So you might think that your way of seeing
the world is right, but the three Bills and I
are here to suggest that perhaps you are all partially right. So instead of choosing one perspective
and getting a partial view, how might we integrate
different perspectives and gain a bigger view? Well, that is the inspiration
behind what you all just watched. A performance of my latest production, ""Faces of X."" ""Faces of X"" is a series of short videos that integrate different perspectives on culture war issues
like gender, abortion, and race. You know, keeping it light. The format is simple. Each video first presents
the strongest arguments on each side, the thesis and the antithesis, and then attempts to integrate them
into a synthesis perspective. Thesis, antithesis and synthesis
are all played by the same person. So you all just watched the first ever
live performance of ""Faces of X."" (Applause) The great Bill Heck just showed you
""Faces of Capitalism."" But the potential pipeline
of the series is infinite. Imagine ""Faces of Artificial
Intelligence,"" right? Imagine ""Faces of Free Speech."" Imagine ""Faces of"" whatever issue
you are wrestling with. And I do take requests,
so come talk to me after. But zooming out,
what does it actually mean to integrate different perspectives? Well, one thing it doesn't mean
is meeting in the middle. Given the complexity
of the challenges we face, instead of meeting in the middle, I want to see us move from the horizontal
plane to a new dimension, from common ground to higher ground. Let's think not just in terms
of changing hearts and minds, but of expanding hearts and minds. So one metaphor I love is parallax vision. The view from our right eye is slightly different
than the view from our left eye. Each eye gives us a view
that's true, but partial. So it's by looking
through both eyes together, along with other visual cues, that the world goes
from flat to 3D, right? Integrating different perspectives
quite literally gives us greater depth. So a question that I always
get asked is: How? How do we integrate
different perspectives? Well, it's an art and a science and something that has been
explored at length by thinkers from
Georg Hegel to Ken Wilber. But for us here today, I'm going to distill it
into three questions that I ask myself. Here we go. First question: Is there an either/or
that can be flipped to a both/and? Well, on the issue of race -- yep, we're going there -- the problem is framed
as either the system, which is racist, or the individual, who should pull themselves up
by their bootstraps. But naturally, the drivers of racial disparity
lie originally with the system, but now also to an extent
with the individual, which means we must build systems
that empower individuals. The question isn’t just
do race-based policies work but how might we use race based-policies in a way that allows us
to not need them anymore? Second question: Is there an opportunity
to shift from “what’s right” to ""under what circumstances, if any""? On the issue of abortion,
we can shift from “Who’s right, pro-choice or pro-life?” to “Under what circumstances
should abortion be legal?” And if we leave out ""all circumstances""
and ""no circumstances,"" and we integrate the rest of the views
of the American public, we will likely end up with a policy that generally elevates
the rights of the woman up until a point of viability, and then elevates the rights of the fetus, while making exceptions for rape, incest and a threat
to the life of the mother. And finally, are there perverse incentives that are making the issue
harder to resolve? So on the issue of gender transition, we are up against
a social media business model that drives poor body image, outrage and polarization, and a healthcare industry that is built around intervention. So if we addressed
these upstream incentives, then more of us could trust that an individual
is making a gender transition not because social media made
them feel awful about their body, but because that's truly
the right thing for them. Now this kind of integration
does get confused with both-sidesism, the idea that all sides
are equally relevant and valuable. It also gets confused with relativism, the idea that there’s no absolute truth,
and everything is contextual. But the reality is it's unlikely
that one of us is entirely right. Usually that's a sign of tribalism. It's also unlikely that all
of us are equally right. That's both-sidesism. What's most likely is that most of us
are partially right, and some of us are more right than others, which doesn't make for a great tagline. But that's what's up when we're contending
with the complexity of reality. So next time you are
in a gridlocked argument about some hot political issue, assume that the other person
has some nugget of insight, and your job is to find it and incorporate it into your perspective. Challenge yourself
to not just listen to each other and hang out on the horizontal plane, but to enter a new dimension. Thank you.

ZZ0BOEOtD2U,"I'll start today
with some obscure music history. So if you're a David Bowie fan,
you may already know this, but the chorus of the song ""Starman"" was actually borrowed from a 1937
blues song by T-Bone Fletcher, which I'm going to play you a clip of. (Audio) There’s a starman
waiting in the sky He’d like to come and meet us but he thinks he’d blow our minds There’s a starman waiting in the sky (Music ends) Now I love Bowie's cover, but there’s just something
about a beat-up guitar and an old man singing
straight from the soul, that, to me, really gets
to the emotion of the song. And I think what's most interesting
is that I just made up that entire story. It was actually 100 percent AI. (Laughter) I apologize for lying,
but there is a reason for it. I'd like to start with a question. What is real music? Now this is a question
that’s come up with synthesizers, with sampling and hip hop music, even with the phonograph,
when it first came out in the 1800s, people back then debated whether or not reproduced
music was real music. John Philip Sousa, the Taylor Swift of his day, was not a fan. He said that phonographs
were ""a substitute for human skill, intelligence and soul.” ... ""They reduce the expression
of music to a mathematical system."" It almost sounds like he's talking
about AI, doesn't it? So is AI real music? I believe that when it's
in the hands of musicians, it can be. But first, let me give you some context
for why I think that. So I run a parody music
social media channel called “There, I Ruined It.” This is just a -- thank you. This is just a weird
evening hobby of mine. My day job is as an advertising
creative director. But the purpose of the channel
is to ruin music. Or, as I say, to lovingly
destroy your favorite songs. And AI is one of the tools
that I often use to do that. So, for example, here is my cover
of the 50 Cent song ""In Da Club"" as performed by an AI version of country
music legend Conway Twitty. (Music) You can find me in the club,
a bottle full of bub I'm into having sex I ain't into making love So come give me a hug If you're into gettin' rubbed Go shawty, it's your birthday We’re gonna party like it’s your birthday When I pull up out front You see the Benz on the dubs (Laughter) Thank you. (Applause) So how did I create that song? The band you heard
is actually a real band. In fact, that's me playing the fiddle. There's just one extra step
in the process where I ran my vocals, my impersonation of Conway Twitty, through a custom AI voice model
trained on his voice. So to give you another example,
along with a peek behind the curtain, in this next clip,
you'll hear my actual voice followed by the post-AI version. And this is from a song that I call “The Red Hot Chili Peppers
Make a Grocery List.” (Music: Red Hot Chilli Peppers,
“Can’t Stop”) [My vocals] Quinoa, bananas, ravioli Canned tuna, pickles, macaroni [Anthony Kiedis (AI)]
Quinoa, bananas, ravioli Canned tuna, pickles, macaroni Now the David Bowie blues song
I played for you in the beginning, that was actually created
in a totally different way. That was 100 percent AI
from a text prompt, which to me is a little more unnerving. In fact, when I first generated that song, it kind of messed with my head a little
because I love old music, I perform music from that era, and to hear the pain in that man's voice, who never existed -- something about that just
felt a little wrong to me. And that's why I lied
to you guys up front. I suspect that some of you
may have enjoyed that song up until the point
you found out it was AI. And to me, that would imply that maybe there's more
to music than the music. So is music melody and rhythm and chords, or is music expression? And to a listener, does it always matter? If I hear a song I love on the radio, am I going to stop everything
and research how that song was created? Maybe not. It gets even messier when you look
at the range of ways that AI can be used to create music. So, for example, what if I used AI to help
with some song lyrics? Is that much different than,
say, a rhyming dictionary? What if I used AI to create a new
instrument sound that's never existed? Is that much different than a synthesizer? What if I trained an AI model
on my entire body of work, and it created a new song in my style? Is that something I would put my name on? Or what if I wanted
to use different voices like a guitarist can use
different guitars? Or am I just stuck with the voice
that I happen to be born with? So I have a coworker
with a great baritone voice, and he was very amused one day when I asked him if I could
purchase his voice for a song that I was working on. So I'll play you a clip of that. So this is my singing through
my coworkers voice, and it's the song ""Baby Got Back,"" but set to the tune
of ""Hallelujah"" by Leonard Cohen. (Laughter) (Music) I like big butts, I cannot lie You other brothers can't deny When a round thing's in your face you get sprung! When a girl walks in you pull up tough Cause you noticed
that her butt was stuffed My homeboys tried to warn me Me so horny! (Laughter) (Applause) I did enjoy just looking across the faces
of this esteemed audience as that song was playing. (Laughter) I'll give you one more example. So in this next clip, you'll hear a melody
I made up on my violin. And then I asked AI to turn that
into a dramatic movie score. (Real violin) (AI dramatic violin) (Music ends) So all this to say,
there are a million ways to use AI. The term AI music
doesn't really clarify anything. And in fact, even our own lawmakers
don't really seem to understand this. So there was a recent
US congressional hearing on AI music where they played my mashup of AI Johnny Cash
singing the song ""Barbie Girl,"" to which Representative
Matt Gaetz replied, ""Robots should not be subject
to free speech."" Now for the record, I am not a robot, but I do think this illustrates
some of the confusion around this topic, which kind of leaves musicians like myself to come up with our own guardrails
for how to use AI, what's right and what's wrong. And for me, it kind of
comes down to three things. The first is, is it deceptive? Could somebody believe
this is actually real? Next, is there artistic intent behind it? So if you're one of these people
that's mass producing AI songs, hundreds of songs,
and uploading them to Spotify, your intent is probably not artistic. And then finally, how does
this affect the musicians? And oftentimes, the victims
of the songs that I create actually end up sharing
those same songs on social media. So, for example,
here's a clip of Snoop Dogg reacting to a mashup I made called ""The Bare Necessities
are Gin and Juice."" May I kick a little something For the Gs and make a few ends As I breeze through? Two in the mornin' And the party's still jumpin'
'Cause my mama ain't home I got bitches in the living
room gettin’ it on And they ain't leaving
til six in the morning So what you wanna do? Shit I got a pocket full of rubbers,
and my homeboys do too. (Laughter and applause) So when I see people like Snoop
and Ed Sheeran and Nicki Minaj and others sharing these things, to me it's hopefully an indication
that, in my own weird way, I'm using these technologies
to contribute something new to the world. And I think at the end of the day, even with all of the many downsides
of AI messing with our music, I think a lot of artists
are discovering the same thing I did, which is there are ways to use AI
that can actually increase creativity. I think we could see
new songs, new sounds, new styles that maybe
we can't even imagine today. Much like it would have been hard
for somebody like John Philip Sousa to have imagined this final monstrosity
I'm going to play for you. This is a song that, when my wife
first heard it, she said, ""This is the stupidest
thing I've ever seen."" (Laughter) And this goes out to all
the Nickelback fans. (Music) Look at this photograph It’s a photo of a photograph There’s another f**kin’ photograph Because I photographed the photograph So many photographs Makes me wanna take a photograph I should probably hang that photograph next to my photo of a photograph. [Nickelback ""The Phonograph""] Look at this phonograph! Every time I do, it makes me laugh! Hear the sounds of the ragtime dance! All the gals wanna get in my pants! But back to that photograph It reminds me of the photograph (Before the photo of that photograph) (When it was just a normal photograph) (Music ends) Thank you all so much. (Cheers and applause)",unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
vWDrFjKHGMY,"You're watching How to be a better human. I am your host, Chris Duffy, and today on the show, we're talking about writing. Now, I write professionally, but really the main way that I write is every morning I try and journal. I've been doing this for years, and look, a lot of my material is not uh Puliter Prizeworthy entries, okay? I'm journaling about how much I don't want to journal or how much I need to clean my desk. But occasionally, I will go back to an old journal entry. Most of the time they're not stuff that I would ever want to read again. But sometimes that source of raw material is so interesting and and it can help me in what I think is maybe the biggest reason why I journal, which is to put words onto the page and then to figure out what I think to process my life. Today's guest, Ashley C. Ford, is one of the absolute best people in the world at this. She is the author of the best-selling memoir, Somebody's Daughter. It's about Ashley's childhood. It's about growing up with a father who was incarcerated. It's about dealing with abuse and violence. But most of all, it is a book that is about the value of writing truthfully about yourself and about the people you love. So today on the show, we are talking about why we write, how we write, and what that can tell us about ourselves and about the truth. >> Hi, I'm Ashley C. Ford, author and podcast host. I'm so excited to be here and can't wait to talk. You have this way of capturing imagery in writing that's so vivid, especially imagery of like being a a young kid and these like really powerful moments. How do you as a writer like mind your own experiences, but also how does that change the way that you remember them? >> You know, memoir for me is about what we remember at its core. It's about what does this individual person remember about their lives? how what what is the lens that they filter that memory through? Um how do you choose to share that memory? Do you choose to share that memory? How much do you trust your memory? All of those things, right? And my relationship with my memory has been one that is both a blessing and a curse. I remember colors. I remember details. I remember what people were wearing. I remember the pitch of their voices. I remember the pitch of the voices behind their voices. you know, all of those things. It's like being back in that moment. And there are a few reasons why I think that's the case. One of those reasons is my eyesight. Um, I have really, really terrible eyesight. And I do mean terrible, legally blind without my glasses eyesight. And I spent most of my life um up until around fourth grade uh not having glasses even though my eyesight was that bad. And I sort of dealt with that by memorizing where things were, memorizing details that could be seen in a fuzzy way and not necessarily clearly. So that's part of it. Another part of it is that I come from what I call the hook generation of kids. You know, I grew up on films that very much held on to the plot point that something happened in adulthood, something was lost in adulthood. They'd forgotten what it was like to be children. They'd forgotten what they knew when they were children in order to survive in the world. And that had caused them to become adults who hurt children. So yeah, when I'm writing memory, I'm I'm writing from this very personal experience of memory that as I think about it, you know, more as I grow, I just I see all these moments that changed how I memorize things and how I share things. >> I write for almost the exact opposite reason, which is like I write things down. I'm really like big into journaling and writing because if I don't they just disappear, right? Like the the narratives that stay for me are the narratives that are like >> ones that I tell or that other people around me tell over and over. And so I have this real sense that like my memory is a shifting sand and it is not necessarily reliable. >> And I have written and talked very much about the fact that I remember deciding to make memories as a child. I remember having these moments and saying to myself, ""This is one of those things you've got to hold on to because this is going to help you make sure you're the person that you want to be uh as you get older and that you're not just doing things because that's what other people are doing or because someone else says that that's what's right. If you remember this moment right now, then it will protect you from a future version of yourself who doesn't care. I also had this thing where I was convinced when I was a kid that I was supposed to be able to remember my father who had truly only been in my life for seven six or seven months before he went to prison. Um, but I felt guilty about not being able to remember him. I I want to talk a little bit more about that like making memory as a way of shaping who you want to be because that strikes me as something that really we could all be doing. And I think I'm at least so rarely conscious of that, of being like, ""This is something I want to remember because I want to be like this or not be like this or care for people who go through this."" >> I knew I was going to grow up. I knew I was going to get older. I didn't know what happened to make adults so different from kids, but I knew that I liked the kid version of me >> and I desperately wanted to hold on to her even if other people didn't like her. The things I wanted to hold on to I could keep in my in my mind. And so I made a memory, I guess, the way a child thinks to make a memory, which is to sit quietly and close your eyes, be in the moment, replay the moment in your head, and feel everything around you. >> We're talking about it in the context of you being a a child. Have you done this as an adult, too? Have you done this recently? This idea of intentionally making memories. >> The stakes feel different as an adult. Uh, I trust myself a lot more as an adult to be able to remember my values more than a specific moment to fuel me. Um, and I find that I kind of like the surprise as an adult of remembering things that I did not expect to remember and that I didn't try to remember. I think sometimes when people have um written about uh tough experiences in their life, right, like having your your father be incarcerated, experiencing sexual assault, having like people with in your life experience violence or or you experiencing violence, people like only see you through the lens of like the very serious stuff. And you are also so funny and silly and joyful. So, how how have you changed like the way you think about like humor and silliness and just goofiness? But I've always been, you know, the jokester. I've always sort of been the class clown. Um, the personality hire, if you will. >> I did standup comedy for years when I was in college and really loved it and >> stopped mostly because I didn't like comedians very much. Even though even though I loved doing comedy, it's been the thing that helped me form most of my relationships from the beginning. My friendships, um, it's the reason why my teachers and professors loved me even though I was not always doing great in their classes. It really greases a lot of wheels to be a person who, you know, makes people laugh in general. And since the book has come out, one of the trickiest things has been having conversations with people who really want to talk to me from a place of, you know, taking the issues that happened in my book seriously, which I do take seriously and I talk about and write about very seriously. But like most things in reality, it's complex. I get a lot of I loved your book. I didn't expect you to be so bright. >> I didn't expect you to be so joyful. You know, my husband, he tells people all the time when they go to buy the book or are questioning, you know, whether or not they should get the book, he always says, you know, you want to read it and you want to think about it, but just remember she turns out okay. And this has been a great dichotomy in my life, you know, that I've always, I think, like I said, been the funny person, been the person who can make people joke, but I've also always pretty easily made people cry. And even though now I accept the reality that both of those things are true about me, for for a long time, I couldn't believe that anybody thought I was funny enough to laugh. And I couldn't believe that anybody thought what I said mattered enough to cry over it. >> It feels like there's three really big virtues that are kind of in communication here, right? Like honesty, creativity, and perseverance. There's a way in which those three are really working together in your experience, and I think many people will find that like the more you're honest, the more creative you are. And the more creative you are, the more honest you can be. And then both of those things can help you persevere in a way that you probably it would be a lot more difficult to persevere if you >> didn't have those two other things. >> Absolutely. I mean I I think sometimes people will say to me, ""Man, you're so brave to have written these things."" And I want to tell them sometimes I'm not as brave as I am tired and I don't have the energy literally to pretend and to keep up a charade. I I don't have it. I can't pretend that I don't see what I see. I can't pretend I don't hear what I hear. Some people can. Good for them. I can't do it. And in a lot of cases, I've tried to do it the other way. >> I've tried to do it what I thought was the easy way or what you think is the easy way and I could not get motion. I couldn't get an inch forward. And a lot of times for me, and I think this is true for a lot of people, until you can be honest and and start to create, you don't move. And stagnation to me feels worse than almost anything else. >> I want to talk to you about a couple of uh passages in Somebody's Daughter, if that's okay. >> Absolutely. >> It's a conversation with your father that you have um towards the end of the book, and he says, ""Do me a favor, Ashley. When you write about you and me, just tell the truth, your truth. Don't worry about nobody's feelings, especially not mine. You got to be tough to tell your truth, but it's the only thing worth doing next to loving somebody. I'm just curious uh how that passage has has changed in meaning or if it has changed in meaning since since the book has been published. You know, I I wrote those words uh because of what they meant to me at the time, which was that my story was mine. And I I had to be able to respect and honor the voice of my child self enough to let her speak without tempering it with the feelings and concerns of the adults who loved her uh but could not show up for her. It's okay, you know, for me to tell that story. And I continue to feel that way that it was okay for me to tell that story, that it's okay for me to continue to talk about that story. It's been an extremely positive experience and it still means what I felt like it meant there, that my story is mine and it's worthy of being told no matter who listens or who cares. There's this passage also in in Somebody's Daughter that I wanted to to read because I thought it was such a fascinating moment where um you're you're writing about yourself. You're you're a young kid and it's your mom and your brother and you and you're playing this game. Basically, the game is your mom turns off the lights and she says, ""I'm not your mother."" And then she gets one of you. >> Um >> and you say basically you you got scared that it actually wasn't your mother, that it was something else. and you run and you get you get a knife. And then this is what you wrote. When she saw me standing there, four years old and more than ready to mortally wound her for daring to touch the person, your brother I loved most in the world. She laughed. My mother laughed so hard she couldn't stop laughing. Her uncontrollable laughter made my brother and me laugh and we laughed with her. The three of us fell to the floor, clutched our stomachs, and rolled around with laughter. My mother laughed until she wet herself and then she laughed harder. That was the last time we played that game, but there were others. It really stuck with me that moment because it's so funny and it's so scary and tense and >> there's so much nuance in that. And so I think just selfishly as a person who thinks about comedy and humor, I I'm just really curious to hear >> what you think about like laughing hard and it maybe being a complicated laugh because I think we don't talk a lot about complicated laughs. Listen, complicated laughs are the story of my life. They are the Oh my gosh. First of all, I grew up in a house where I laughter was very very much encouraged. Um, there was a lot of anger in my house and there was a lot of fear in my house, but there was also a lot of laughter and those existed within moments of each other sometimes. And I noticed that a lot of the things that I read and a lot of things that I saw kept these experiences so separate and that was not what I had lived. That was not my experience. There are many I think elements of the laughter, horror, fear, crying, like all of that. And and and a lot of it comes from like extreme emotion, but also a lot of it, at least in my opinion, in black households, comes from a great reverence for absurd humor. >> When something is absurd, I mean, and just why would that happen? That's when we laugh the most and the hardest because most things are that are absurd should just be laughed at. >> They shouldn't be taken seriously and they shouldn't be feared. They should be cackled at. You should be in stitches about that, not having to have fear or worry about it. If someone is listening and they are really interested in writing non-fiction, especially creative non-fiction, um, but they're not quite sure how to go about it, they have some fear about delving into their personal stories. What advice would you would you give to someone who's thinking about writing about their own life? >> Well, the first thing I would say is that writing and publishing are not the same thing. If you feel like you want to write about your life and you're not sure if that's something you want to share or publish, those decisions can come later. Um there's nothing that says because you write something you have to give it to anyone, show it to anyone or let anyone read it. >> Another thing I would say is that um silence is not an equitable trade for love. >> People who need you to be silent about the way you hurt them in order for you to prove that you love them or forgive them are not people who are loving you very well in that request. It's a very human request to make but it is not loving. We have to decide whether or not uh we can allow a person to put those kind of parameters on their love for us or on our love for them. >> What is your personal definition of of love and care? My personal definition of love and care is extending kindness and compassion first and freely and trusting that the accountability I hold the people I love to uh is mutual and that they are able to hold me accountable in those same ways and for those same reasons. I don't think that because I love a person I need to or have to deny the parts of them that may be flawed or wanting. I think in fact that loving them requires me to be honest with them about those things. >> It also relates to I know something people ask you about a lot too which is um reconciliation. You know, when people ask me about things like, ""How did you continue to love your dad after finding out what he did after knowing who he had hurt?"" And the truth is, I mean, I can't really tell you how. I can just tell you that I did. >> You know, it wasn't a matter of how do I go back to loving my dad? How do I hold on to my love for my dad? It was that my love for my dad never went away. all of these other things came in. Like the love was still there the whole time. I just stopped >> being ashamed of myself >> for loving him. I don't have to forget anything. And I don't have to forgive him for anything specific. I don't have to say I forgive you for what you did. I don't have to say I forgive you for who you hurt. A I don't think I can forgive him for somebody else. and B, that's not what my forgiveness is. My forgiveness is you get to be part of my life >> and we get to see what happens from here. >> Ashley C4, this has been such a pleasure. Thank you so much for being on the show. >> Thank you, Chris.

vhvyid7vVoQ,"What do you see
when you picture world hunger? A skinny, starving kid in Africa? An aid worker swooping in to save the day? A grain sack stamped
with a flag of a distant nation? Now picture something else. A farmer harvesting fresh crops, secure in the knowledge
that they will feed local schoolchildren instead of disappearing
at a throwaway price to a volatile market. Bustling kitchens across Kenya,
serving thousands of meals daily, powered by clean energy
and run by local women. A mother contributing to her child's lunch
with a tap of a wristband. Now the world has long treated hunger as a crisis that Africa suffers
and the West solves. But what if Africa had the blueprints
to feeding the future? I was raised in a home
where generosity was a way of life. My parents were health care workers
and church leaders, and that meant they were
always willing to help, even when we didn't have much ourselves. I'll tell you a story. My dad once sold our TV, the only TV we had, to help someone who needed the money. It sounds so altruistic now, but as a kid, I was really pissed at that. (Laughter) And I'm kind of still pissed at it. (Laughter) Our home was never really just ours. There was always someone staying with us. Someone who needed a meal. Someone who they just could not turn away. But that spirit shaped me. When I started a school lunch program, I was not trying to end world hunger. I was a 21-year-old university student trying to help kids
in my community of Ruiru, a town that's outside of Nairobi,
the capital of Kenya. Back where I grew up, kids in my neighborhood
did not end up like me. While I went to school,
well-fed, ready and able, they went to class on empty stomachs. And as a result,
many of them were held back, and others dropped out. But I know every single one of them
saw their potential being wasted. Hunger was a thief of opportunity, one that we had to stop
before it swallowed us all. So as a nutrition student, I started researching
on school feeding programs. But what I mostly found
was flawed systems and broken promises. Across Africa, a lot of the food supply was run by foreign organizations, and it was aid-based. They relied on warehouses
full of imported food, sidelining local producers and not involving
local communities or governments. Elsewhere in the West,
where school meals were almost universal, they had issues of their own. Programs relied on processed foods
and complex supply chains that were harmful to the environment
and local economies. At home in Kenya,
outside a few targeted programs, a few schools provided kids meals, but it was often expensive
and inefficient. Schools would often require parents
to pay in advance, which was inconceivable
for low-income families. Quality was also an issue, with high incidences
of spoilage and contamination. So I stopped. I stopped looking for the perfect model, and I started looking
at the strengths of the communities and the people around me. That was a start of Food 4 Education, an African-led and locally run solution
to ending childhood hunger. School feeding programs
have existed for hundreds of years. It's one of the most bankable
social safety nets a society can offer. In fact, I'm so sure
many of you may remember your favorite school meal
from your younger days, and I hope that memory is a good one. And yet, Africa has the lowest penetration
of school feeding programs globally, at just 19 percent. If school meals can be ubiquitous
in New York and London, they can and should be in Africa too. Schools are where children gather,
where they spend most of their day. In fact, we have 600 million kids
in Africa today. That's a lot of kids. That makes schools
the most practical and impactful place to deliver critical nutrition. By feeding kids in school,
we're not just giving them calories, we're giving them the ability to focus,
to grow and to thrive. So today, we harness the power
of local governments, parent ownership
and technological ingenuity to provide half a million meals daily. But how? (Applause) Thank you. School feeding programs
have long struggled with global supply chains, so it was obvious to us that we needed
to work with local smallholder farmers. On every plate, there are ingredients
that have been harvested in the most recent season, making our meals fresh, nutritious, delicious and supporting
our local economies. Mary, a supplier from my hometown, now provides us 10,000 times
the number of bags of beans than she provided to us in 2012. Her first delivery to us
was with a motorbike. Her latest ... 65 trucks. (Applause) I love that for her. Our meals are cost-efficient,
at just 30 cents, making it Kenya's
most affordable and nutritious meal. Parents contribute a subsidized amount, and kids just tap to eat. Our kitchens are built for scale
and better for the planet. We have built Africa's
largest green kitchen in Nairobi, feeding 60,000 kids a day. But the key to this work
is working hand in hand with government. Although it's hard, as a truly African and local organization, we've been able to partner
with our government for long-term sustainability. When governments commit to school feeding, it can mean real kitchens, real budgets and real policy changes. It can mean instead of a child
relying on an NGO that might go away tomorrow, they can rely on something greater: a public commitment
to their right to food and education. We want to see that across Africa. We are redefining
what school meals can and should be. Since that first tiny kitchen,
feeding 25 kids a day, we've served over 100 million meals. (Applause) We will feed a million kids a day
in Kenya by 2030 and two million more
through our work with African governments to make school feeding programs
sustainable and scalable. Today, one in eight people in the world
are African, like me. By 2050, we'll be one in four. These kids are the future
global workforce. We're feeding a future
where kids will know hunger only as a fleeting sense of anticipation and not a constant state of being. A future where all African kids
can live up to their potential. But this is not just
a Kenyan story or an African story. It's the world's. How we feed our kids determines
the kind of planet they'll inherit. And if we get it right in Africa, the place where humanity began, we might just show the world
the way forward. Thank you. (Applause)",unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5GVqOpLDA8c,"Throughout my entire career, I've been telling innovative
stories through technology. And one thing I realized
is that there's a magic in personalization with the viewer when they see
themselves in the story. For example. (Laughter) I was responsible for putting your face on a dancing elf during the holidays. (Applause) I am also very proud to have given you
your own personal stalker with ""Take This Lollipop."" No applause for that one? Come on. (Laughter) And I also transported people
all over the world to Melbourne, Australia, where I let you control tourists. Then, during the pandemic, I put you into a Zoom-like
interactive horror film showing you the dangers
of deepfake technology. But I created something
recently that wasn't interactive, it wasn't personalized. It was a short film. It was set in gritty 1970s New York City, and this blaxploitation film featured
a kung fu warrior out for revenge. And it featured big set pieces,
loads of special effects, and it also featured one
of the most iconic hip hop bands of all time, the Wu-Tang Clan. Now traditionally, this would have cost
millions of dollars to produce and taken months and months of time, but it was created by just a few people in under three weeks, all from the comforts of our home. Now I began as a traditional filmmaker, and I realized that everything
that you saw on screen before is a string of text, which is otherwise known as a prompt. And when I was on set, I'm constantly prompting
all my department heads. I'm taking what's in my brain, and it's a string of texts that ends up
basically communicating my vision. With generative AI, I'm able to do the same thing. I take what’s in my head and I put it into a series of prompts. This is the lead character, this is Mandingo. This is his prompt. That's casting. Then it comes to virtual wardrobe styling. So black leather pants,
gold shirt, fur coat, that created Claudine. Now I have to remind you,
this is all text. Then, when it comes to location scouting, here is a massive restaurant in Chinatown. Then we have the Jade nightclub. Then we have a dojo on a rooftop. All of these create a 4.5-minute
music video that felt like a feature film. And one of the most amazing things
is, with generative AI technology, we are able to build massive
story worlds in days, not months, not years. So I had this idea. What if, in a few days from now, I could get everyone in this room
to help me create a short film? Are you guys down? (Cheers and applause) First we have to choose our genre. Sci-fi, thrillers, what else? Who wants to go? (Audience shouting) I heard rom-com. Sci-fi, western, comedy, anime, horror. OK, a lot. What if we did rom-com? Anybody for that? OK, what about thriller? (Audience cheers) Sci-fi? (Audience cheers) OK, sci-fi is the winner. Now we get to choose our character. So choose your fighter. Who's it going to be? Could be anything. (Audience shouting) Animal, OK, what kind of animal? Beaver? Oh that's great. Beaver, OK, how many for beaver? (Cheers) OK, so we got sci-fi and a beaver. Got it. I have no idea where this is going to go. So next up is location. Now we don’t have to pay
location fees, so dream big. (Audience shouting) The moon? OK, how many for the moon? It's sci-fi, let's get
a little more unexpected. Where can we set sci-fi? (Shouting) Underwater. OK, how many for underwater? (Cheers) Sci-fi, underwater. OK, perfect. Last but not least,
we have to choose our own objects. So this is really the thing
that helps drive our story forward. Any ideas? Big red button, I like that. What else? A submarine? Magic what? Magic sock, OK. (Laughter) Alright, so my team and I,
over the next couple days, are going to create a film
that is born from this moment. All of you, with your creativity,
your participation, helped create this. Because AI doesn't replace storytellers. It gives us superpowers. And I would like everybody
in this audience to please dream bigger with me together. Thank you. (Applause) [Three days later ...] Helen Walters: Alright, Jason. So how'd it go? Jason Zada: Well, I haven't
slept in a few days. Also figured out, at 4am, woke up in a panic, going, ""How do I tell a story
about a beaver and a magic sock?"" And, remember that everything
goes back to story. And if we start with a great story, there's a good foundation for a story, everything kind of works its way out. So I think we figured out
an interesting story about a beaver, his magic sock, underwater, and how to blend that with sci-fi. And I think one of the interesting
things about it all is that, you know, this whole audience created something that I never would have
created in my own head. HW: No, definitely not. JZ: I wouldn't have picked
those things in a million years. But when you're dealt with those cards, you sort of improvise, and you go back to the foundation
of what makes a great story. HW: I think one of the most important
questions that I have to ask you is, does the beaver have a name? (Laughter) JZ: If I said no, would that be bad? HW: I mean, it's on your conscience. JZ: He did have a name,
I forgot it by this point, because we just started
calling him Beaver. HW: So when you talked about the
Wu-Tang Clan piece that you made, that was like, three weeks that you said. And we gave you three days, essentially. So how high should our expectations be? (Laughter) JZ: Set them as low as possible because it will only get
better from there. I mean, one of the great things
is that when you're dealt with -- I actually really love time constraints because you're forced to make decisions, you're forced to live
with those decisions. And you really just kind of
have to live in that moment. And there's no second-guessing yourself. There's never like, well, you know -- I mean, we did change things, but at the end of the day, you know,
when it's done, it's done. HW: Well, it is done. Does the piece have a name? JZ: It is called ""Submerged."" We had another name
that we were going to go with. ""Damned."" (Laughter) HW: Right, right, cheery. JZ: But, yeah, we decided
to go with ""Submerged."" HW: Let's watch ""Submerged."" Thank you, Jason. JZ: Thank you.

WknzP23-y_Y,"Like many of you, I was enamored
by the hustle culture. As a VP of People
and multi-time HR executive, I've led many teams
and companies through burnout. I've also gone through it myself. Turns out, a lot of us have. Studies show that at least
one in four employees globally have experienced burnout. Burnout sucks. If you know, you know. But you know what's worse? It's dimming your light and your ambition. You see, your ambition
is a very special gift. It's that fire in you
that keeps you aspiring for more and pushes you to your fullest potential. I believe, with the right tools, you can nurture your ambition and avoid burnout. This all starts with learning
to set and maintain your boundaries within work, life and your relationships. Now boundaries kind of
have a bad reputation, right? Some people think of them
as an excuse to work less. Others as a reason to say no
to everybody and everything. And some even believe
they minimize your dreams. But boundaries are actually
what empower you to do more and do it better. Boundaries give your ambition
a sense of rhythm and pace so you can create
what I call sustainable ambition. So what's the secret sauce? How do we effectively set boundaries? Well, it starts with this hard truth: you can't do everything and avoid burnout. I'll paint the picture for you. It's four weeks away
from that big deadline. You have mouths to feed,
a home to maintain, workouts to attend. And then boom, the inconvenient thing happens. Your child is sick.
You're rushing to the vet. Or the worst. You receive bad news that rocks you. You're now sitting there in this predicament
of trying to figure out: How am I going to do it all? Well, guess what? You're not. (Laughter) Before you can even begin
to tackle your goals, you have to make peace with the reality
that you can't do and be everything, especially in these moments
of the unknown. Pushing yourself
to the point of unsustainability is an extremely toxic cycle. And unsustainability
and unrealistic expectations are exactly where burnout starts. So let's talk about
how you can create a system to support your ambitions and your boundaries. First, you have to get crystal clear
on your non-negotiables. It's up to you to decide what tasks
and what habits are essential for you when you hit those high-pressure moments. A non-negotiable could be something
like meditating 10 minutes a day, getting to your kid’s baseball game or prioritizing that workout. As it does, life be lifing, and it'll throw you another curve ball. And when it does,
I want you to ask yourself: How am I going to prioritize
my non-negotiable? What is the trade-off? A trade-off is typically something
like rescheduling a social activity, canceling your golf lesson. This one's a little controversial, but maybe you're not watching
Sunday Night Football. I know, I know, it's football season. At the end of the day, we can't control all the things
that are happening around us, but we can control how we react. So it's up to us to accept
these trade-off moments, adapt and move forward. The second step is becoming aware
of what I call your time bank. Now when you're frugal with your time, you have more time for your ambitions and your non-negotiables. And when you're frivolous with your time, you're running on that hamster wheel from one thing to another
to another to another. So just like you would ponder
a big purchase, the next time somebody requests
your time or a commitment from you, I want you to ask yourself, is this time worth spending? Is this feasible? I like to ask myself: Is future me going to be mad
at current me if I say yes to this? It's important to talk to future you. And does this align
with what future me wants? As you would be selective
with a big purchase, learn to be selective
with your time commitments. This is how you learn
to protect your time. The final step to sustaining
your ambition is my favorite. Clearly communicating your boundaries. Now nobody likes to say no. It's extremely uncomfortable. We know this. I'm going to give you a few examples
of how you can do this. The first could sound something like, ""I'd love to help with that,
but I only have 30 minutes today. Is that enough time to get us started?"" Or it could be, ""Thank you so much
for the invite, but I already have plans."" Or maybe it's, ""Mrs. Manager, this project
sounds so exciting, but I'm already at capacity. I'm happy to help with this, but I will need to shift
and reprioritize my deadlines."" Now when we first start to say no,
it will be extremely uncomfortable, kind of cringe, you're probably
going to feel guilty. This is natural. When this happens, I want you to remember: your work, your life
and your relationships will never set boundaries for you. It's up to you to create them. After all, only you know your limits, your potential and your needs. Starting to leverage clear communication
as a resource and a tool will contribute to a higher-performing and more sustainable version of you. So to bring us full circle, the hustle culture that we've been
entrenched in for too long is being taken over
by a generation of workers that are prioritizing work-life balance. The Gen Zs have completely
run away from the hustle culture, yet the millennials are still stuck in it. It's two sides of a spectrum. But what if the sweet spot
is actually in the middle? This means we hustle when we need to, because goals do require hard work. And we prioritize balance
and boundaries when we need to because we must rest, recharge
and reconnect with others. A life with boundaries
is a sustainable one. Give yourself the permission
to have the time to crush your goals, the space for rest and the energy to continue to dream big. It's time we let our ambitions light us up
and not burn us out. Thank you. (Applause)",unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5MyCtvSBATI,"I'm a digital cartographer by trade, and honestly, the last two,
three, four presentations have been incredible. Maps, historically,
they do really two things, and we've really seen
an amazing amount of the first: understanding our world. But historically, maps weren't
just about understanding. They were also about creating,
about building, about shaping the built
environment around us. They help us plan cities,
do trade, fight wars and maintain peace. And as we've digitized these maps,
you've seen them fit into our pocket. Things that used to take
entire libraries, reams of paper, are now in our pocket or in our eyes. But as we move from the information age
into the cybernetic age, an era dominated
by the application of robotics and artificial intelligence
to the physical world, cartography needs to change. It's not enough to collaborate
in a digital world. The challenge in front of us
is really to take those technologies and to use them to build physically. And for the first time in history, we have the remote
sensing capacity on orbit and the technology
to process all of the data into a dynamic, living replica
of the physical Earth inside of a computer --
what we call the “Living Globe.” You can think of this as a sandbox, a place where you can take
the digital representation of our Earth and combine it with a physical
representation on the ground, and go back and forth
so that sensors can show you what’s actually happening in real-time. Let's make that real. Earlier this year, the Los Angeles
wildfires devastated Southern California. Many of us were personally impacted
or know someone who was. Satellite imagery and mapping
played a critical role in understanding the
impact of that devastation, guiding first responders and shining a spotlight
on the destruction that happened. But it's not enough
just to look, to observe, to react. What's been nagging me since then is that what LA needed, it wasn't satellite imagery, it was water. Large-scale infrastructure
projects, megaprojects, rapid response systems
with firefighting robots that would be able
to take out the fire before it started. This used to be how we thought. 200 years ago, we were a civilization
of builders with a culture of action. We built the Erie Canal, the transcontinental railroad,
the Hoover Dam -- megaprojects that fundamentally
reshaped our Earth, our physical world. But these projects
had devastating ramifications. Unable to predict their impact
and know what the results would be, we retreated into the virtual world, a world of iPhones and personal computers
dominated by individualism. The problem is: the problems
of the 21st century, they're fundamentally physical. They're problems of moving atoms. When you think about climate change,
energy abundance, housing affordability, global security, these are problems that require
regaining a builder's spirit and starting to act
upon the physical world once again. What we've done is we've taken
dozens and dozens of different data sets. We've fused them together into a dynamic
and living representation of the Earth. By pulling these into an ontology so that computers and people
can interact with them together, we can programmatically
start identifying patterns so that we can delegate the monitoring
of those patterns to a computer. What we see here is Vancouver,
a combination of tree height data, Landsat vegetation data and information from
the affordable housing district, showing the blue dots right now. What we can start to identify is patterns, things that we can see about the city that affect the way
that people live in it. You can tell that the areas
that have a lot of trees protect us against heat. This is heat data
showing the density of trees. And when we pan over
to really forested parts of the city, we can tell that the trees are actually
protecting us from that heat. So what we've identified
is really two patterns here. One, that trees are great
for economic development. People really desire
living in places with trees. And two, that trees are critical
for building a lovely, wonderful city. But it's not enough to have a static map,
looking at the past. Our goal is to have a really dynamic map
that’s updating in real-time. And in the background, dozens of satellites
are orbiting the Earth, taking images of Vancouver, so that we can start to move
from mapping to monitoring to building an instrument panel
and a dashboard where we can really understand
what’s happening in our city in real-time. This lets us move away
from thinking about individual projects towards thinking about the city
as a cohesive whole. An integrated system
where all of the projects play together to achieve multidimensional goals. So here we have
all of the building permits in Vancouver right now. But that doesn't really tell us
what's actually happening on the ground. If we use satellite imagery,
we can run change detection algorithms and actually see the places
where change is really happening, where ground is being broken. Zooming into one of those, we can see the actual development
that's occurring in Vancouver. We can see a satellite image
of a construction site. Moving back in time
and turning the trees red with infrared sensors, we can really see
trees blossoming and growing, the vegetation changing over time. And we can see that this particular
one small development in Vancouver cut down a bunch of trees, which is very natural. But in order to have our goal
of having a more forested city, we're going to have to plant
these trees somewhere else, probably north, in that affordable
housing district that we saw earlier. This is what I mean
by using maps to build. We get a dashboard and an instrument panel for understanding the change
in the globe over time, not just in terms
of the spatial information, but in terms of a time series,
in terms of metrics and measures that we can use to guide development. For the last 50 years, we've really framed the question
we have as a society very narrowly: to build or not to build. But the important thing about technology
is that it eliminates trade-offs. It lets you do more with less. This living globe,
it's not just a mirror for the world, it's also a canvas
to build a better future, to visualize it, and then to summon
the collective will to make it happen. I'm really excited to be here
and share this with you, and thank you so much for having me. (Applause)",unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
E74FQTMWPVw,"I want to share with you a plan to fix one of the biggest planetary
market failures of our lifetime. It's been nearly 150 years since Thomas Edison invented
the incandescent light bulb, ushering in the age of electricity. So how can it be that 700
million people on this planet still lack access to electricity? When the Sun goes down,
they depend on dirty, expensive, sometimes
dangerous fuels for light. And these are some of the most overlooked and underestimated people on the planet. But we can solve this problem if we have the moral imagination
to do two things. First, we have to rethink
how we approach risk. And second, we have to address the false binary between mitigation, or reducing emissions, and adaptation, or adjusting
to the climate crisis. Before we talk about that, though,
let's look at what's at stake. We know that the most vulnerable are disproportionately
impacted by climate events. Electricity is resilience. It's agency. It’s light and irrigation
and communications, and it’s cooling. It's also basic empowerment. We live in an age where
tech entrepreneurs are promising that every child on the planet
will have their own AI tutor. Unless you're a child
without access to electricity. The good news is that, as we've discussed, solar energy has been one of the great
success stories of the 21st century. When my organization, Acumen, started investing
in off-grid electricity in 2007, 1.5 billion people on the planet
had no access to electricity. Today, that number has been cut in half. And while off-grid
can't claim full credit, it's been an important part of the story. And I've had the privilege of investing in and witnessing the evolution of this extraordinary off-grid sector that started off with lights, and then we saw home systems
with radios and cell phone chargers, and then emerged the adjacent possible. Solar televisions and cookstoves and solar irrigation
and refrigeration and e-mobility. And today you can see
thousands of electric motorbikes powering down the streets
of Kenya and Rwanda. I've also been able to talk
to so many customers across the continent. Like Susan, who said
that what surprised her when she got her solar system was that she no longer experienced
deep fear every single night. She said, ""I used to fear
bandits, wild animals, men. Or going to the toilet,"" her external toilet --
""And being bitten by a snake."" She said, ""Now I don't feel stressed. My children and I have more connection. And indeed, they'd finished watching
a course on their solar television to learn sign language in Kiswahili
so that for the first time in their lives, they were able to communicate
with their deaf cousins."" Energy is independence, and it has great economic impact. The average family reduces
energy spending by more than 50 percent, and this is a sector that has created
more than 370,000 good jobs. We as a world are on track to reach another 300 million people
by the end of the decade. That still leaves hundreds
of millions living in the dark. These are the hardest to reach. In places like Burundi, with an 11 percent electrification rate. Malawi, 16. Chad, 12. And those aren't just statistics. Those are human beings. And yet, too often we dismiss them
as too poor, too risky, too hard. So let me say this clearly. This is about our shared human dignity. If we believe that all
human beings deserve dignity, and we understand
that the impact of climate will disproportionately impact
the most vulnerable amongst us, then these are precisely the people
on whom we need to focus. Because electricity
isn't just about light. It's about communication during floods, irrigation during droughts. It's about cooling medicines
during heat waves and pandemics. It's about hospitals
and schools, businesses, so that isolated communities,
already fragile, can build resilience
in an increasingly volatile climate. Adaptation matters, but this story has equal
urgency for mitigation. Now today, the continent only contributes
3.5 percent of total global emissions, and the average American consumes
about 1/15 the energy of an American. But those are the wrong numbers
to pay attention to. As Al Gore said, what matters
is future emissions. The continent's population
is expected to grow from 1.5 to 2.5 billion people by 2050. And so the question is,
what kind of energy will fuel it? What we've learned
from investing in off-grid is that once families
are on the first rung of the solar energy ladder, they don't go back. That's good news for the planet
and for its people. If we just brought electricity
to 10 million families, basic level, we would avert more than 27 million
tons of carbon looking forward and create about 10 billion dollars
in direct economic benefit. Multiply that and you get transformation. But how do we do it? The companies are here, but the capital is not. And one thing for certain
is that money cannot be the constraint. Because last year, the world
allocated two trillion dollars to transitioning industry
from fossil fuels to cleaner energy. But less than 800 million
went to off-grid solar. That's less than 0.1 percent. And it makes no sense. Because climate finance isn't scarce. It's scared. And maybe at first glance,
you can understand it. Customers make a few dollars a day. Macroeconomic headwinds, like inflation, depreciation,
have pummeled markets. Inequality, lack of jobs, in some places, uncertain leadership. OK, but if we focus only on narratives
that talk about the problem, we miss the much bigger narrative
of the opportunity. Electricity is foundational. And we can solve this problem, but we need the right kind of capital to open up new energy markets. And a lot of people
have been thinking for a long time about how to do that in ways
that are more important today, in a post-aid era. My organization's been building
on our investing work for many years to create a an initiative called
the Hardest-to-Reach. It's essentially
a multi-layered capital stack that's a blend of philanthropy, impact investing, funds from development
finance institutions and a commercial bank. It starts with 60 million
dollars in philanthropy, so that we can take early-stage
patient capital investments in those companies operating
in the most challenging climates. Philanthropy lets you go fast. So already we've invested
12 million dollars in eight companies in Sierra Leone, Benin, Malawi, the DRC,
and most recently, Somalia. Side by side is a debt facility
that is impact-aligned. It's anchored with funding from
the Green Climate Fund and others. And again, that allows us to bring in
more institutional capital above, including Shinhan, the largest
commercial bank in Korea. Thus far, 21 different stakeholders
across the capital continuum, from grants to impact to commercial, have come together to bring
a quarter billion dollars in financing to Africa's most challenging
energy markets. Now making this happen hasn’t been easy. It has relied on the leadership, the courage and the competence
of a whole lot of people, including in big institutions. But that is exactly the kind
of moral imagination that we need to rethink the way we approach investing. Because it is just not OK
to let financial risk have the final word. (Applause) If we're smart enough and careful enough, we can offset financial risk. But equally important, what is the risk of not daring? Leaving hundreds of millions
of people in the dark and watching instability, emissions and migration rise? It means cutting off human potential,
possibility, creativity. You see, risk is not
just a financial concept. It's an environmental concept,
a social concept. And it is most definitely a moral concept. And so, yes, we can structure
the right kind of capital, but we need all of the players
to go from asking, ""Am I getting the highest return,"" to, ""What is the problem
we're trying to solve? What is the capital that is needed?
And where can I play a role?” And also if you take a long-term
investor's perspective, think about the hundreds of millions
of new electricity consumers that will need new appliances
and new innovations and new services. Completely new markets will emerge. We know this because we've seen this. And though this is hard,
it is eminently within our reach. In history, there aren't that many chances
to do something as big and important and as difficult as bringing electricity
to everyone on the planet. But I sometimes ask myself, in 100 years, what will that generation say about us? Will they gasp in astonishment and say, we were the ones that finally
brought electricity and possibility and human dignity to everyone? Or will they wonder, ""How could they have averted their eyes and left hundreds of millions behind?"" I hope they say we learned
to control capital and technology and not be controlled by it. I hope they say we cared,
that we did hard things. That we loved the world. And in doing so, we set ourselves free. The poet Hafez wrote, ""Even after all these years,
the Sun never says to the Earth, ‘You owe me.’ Look what happens with a love like that. It lights the whole sky."" So let's get going. Thank you.

Z0PeLwgy_Xo,"You're watching How to be a better human. I'm your host, Chris Duffy, and today on the show, we are talking with Dr. Rick Weissboard, a professor at Harvard University. I met Rick when I had just left the teaching job that I was doing, and I was starting to do comedy full-time. And that first year, I was not making a lot of money telling jokes. So, I was taking all sorts of random side gigs and part-time jobs. And the best one that I got by far was helping Rick and his lab at the Harvard Graduate School of Education make these videos that they were using as discussion starters in classrooms. We would get elementary school students one by one in a room and we would ask them, ""What is a time that you did something even though you knew it was wrong?"" And my favorite response by far was from this kid, Pice. Pierce was a very serious young man. And Pierce said, ""Sometimes at night, I sneak into my parents' bedroom. I take their cell phone. I put in their password and then I watch TV on their cell phone. And I was already kind of trying not to laugh and I said, ""Pice, do you ever get caught?"" PICE turned and he perfectly hit the camera and he said, ""Every single time."" To me, that is like one of the funniest things that I've ever seen in real life. Now, those kinds of moral questions, what does it mean to do the right thing when it's hard? Why do we do the wrong thing even though we know it's wrong? This is the bread and butter of what Dr. Rick Weissborg studies. Hi, my name is Rick Weissbour. I'm a psychologist. I'm on the faculty of the Harvard Graduate School of Education and I'm the director of the Making Caring Common Project. The first question that I have for you, Rick, is your book, The Parents We Mean to Be. Um, this book, great book. It came out in 2009. And in this book, you wrote about three really big challenges that you saw facing America when it came to parenting and also to creating moral communities. One of those challenges was expecting more of America's fathers. Another was creating stronger ties among parents. And the third was finding ways to give each other feedback. I'm wondering now we're 16 years later. Where do you think we stand on each of those challenges? Have we made progress? Have we slid backwards? Are we the same place we were? Where are we? I unfortunately don't think we've made much progress. Um in terms of parents and community, we got a lot of isolated, disconnected parents right now. and we have high rates of anxiety and depression among parents. There's a lot of alarm about the teen mental health crisis, but parents in our data are experiencing anxiety and depression at around the same rate as as teens are. Uh so we would be just as right to sound the alarm about a parent mental health crisis as a teen mental health crisis. Yeah. No, I think we're still a culture where parents are allergic to feedback and that's really a problem. And that's not true across race, culture, ethnicity. I mean, you know, in some countries, it's very natural for parents to give each other feedback. They expect to get feedback and parenting is probably the most important thing we do or one of the most important things we do. And we've inoculated ourselves from feedback of any kind. So, one of the things I was just recommending in the in the book is that you you identify one person who you really respect and trust and say to that person, you know, if I'm if I'm ever doing something that might be screwing up my kid, please tell me about it because I want to know about it. I feel like a lot of people don't want to know. You'd rather just think, well, I never do anything wrong. Than to hear that's some really tough feedback. You're doing something that could uh mess up your child. Yeah. No, that that is really tough feedback. I, you know, I had a friend, a close friend who um gave me some feedback about something he was worried about with my parenting when my kids were young. And he's not my friend anymore. No, I'm kidding. He's He's still my friend. But I was ticked off about it. It's really hard to hear, but in some deeper way, I think you also really respect people who trust you enough and are feel close enough to you to give you really tough feedback like that. As we're recording this, I have my first kid who's just a little more than a year old. And it's been an amazing, beautiful, incredible year. It's also been unquestionably one of the most challenging years of either of our lives. I'm sure I speak for my wife Molly when I say that. And part of I think what what is challenging about feedback is I desperately want to get advice and to know that we're making good choices and to get help making better choices. But also sometimes it feels like no one knows. And so taking advice from someone else is just taking their style as opposed to taking some sort of objective good advice. And I feel like that's not what you're saying. That that's actually not true. So push back on me on that. you know, I'm I'm probably going to push back on you less than you would expect. I worry about some of the folks who are giving parent advice who give it um very, you know, forcefully and unequivocally because I still think we don't have great data on these things. Um I mean, there's some things we have good data on. There's some things that we don't have good data on. For example, authoritative parenting. You know, parenting, parents who are not too authoritarian, not too permissive, who listen, who are warm, who are responsive. I mean those things generally are really good for kids but there's lots of domains where you know we don't really we don't really know a lot and I think we're using our best judgment. I think we have to trust the experience of people that we really respect. Um and we also have to pull information from a number of sources and kind of do our best. I wish we could say there was a harder science here but there isn't a hard science at this point for a lot of things. Molly and I kind of identified when she was pregnant who are friends or um friends parents or just parents we know who are role models like who from the outside seem like oh we would like for our relationship with each other and our family and our kid to be like them. That has been really helpful to think of like what would these people who are our north stars do? How do we think they would handle this? And sometimes to literally ask them but even when we're not asking them to just think like how do we think they handled it and why does that matter to us? Yeah, I think that's a great thing to do. And I think it's also, you know, a great thing when your kids get older to increase their opportunities to have contact with these people that you really that you really trust and respect. I mean, there's some friends of my kids' parents who I just thought were wonderful parents and I always felt great when my kids were in those famil family's homes. So, I think understanding what those folks do and increasing our interaction with them is super important. Yeah. You talk about how one of the real challenges of parenting is getting past shame. Shame in yourself and shame about your parenting. And my kid isn't even able to speak yet. He doesn't he doesn't have sentences that he's saying to strangers. And I already can feel moments where I have this real shame where he's yelling or where he's not behaving the way that I think that he should be. And it and a thing that your book, I think, really pointed out in a way that hit home for me is that it's not actually about him. It's about how I want to be perceived as a parent and that it makes me feel like I look bad. One of the differences, big differences between shame and guilt. Guilt is really about a deed. It's really when you do something that violates one of your standards. And guilt usually insists on and reveals a path to repair itself. Shame sort of fers in the self. It's about defects and particularly the public exposure of defects. I think that some of us as parents are more prone to shame than others and it be it does become hard to manage. Kids have their own complicated powerful inner lives. They're going to do things that sometimes are going to feel embarrassing to us. And I think if you're a parent who feels shame in that those moments, it is really important to be able to do some reality testing to have a partner or close friends or whatever who can help you normalize these experiences that kids are having. This is what kids do. Your shame probably has much more to do with you than it does with any action that they have taken. And there just isn't this direct link that your child has problems. It means you're a failed parent. Lots of wonderful parents have kids who are struggling in one way or another. You know, on the one hand, I think as a child development matter, we have to send the message to parents that they do have lots of influences on kids' lives. But we can't send the message that there's a simple linear relationship between what they you do as a parent and how your kid feels because kids do have complex inner lives. They are influenced by many types of things. We are not the only influence on them. So much of your work strikes me as relevant to anyone who is a person whether you have kids or not. Right? These questions of how do we have morality? How do we think about doing the right thing? How do we think about dealing with shame? How do we think about our interactions with other people? Those aren't just questions that depend on having a child or a parent child relationship. They're really interpersonal relationships. They're interpersonal relationships. They're societal and cultural too. I mean, you know, at this moment in time, what I find myself sort of obsessed about is how much morality has been demoted or sidelined in our public life. There's a level of meanness, of lying, of polarization, a fragmentation, of of demonization of people that, you know, has been unprecedented in my lifetime anyway. I'm sure there are other times in history where we've seen things that are like this in some way. And so, I think we're sort of morally off the rails. And so, you know, you're absolutely right. A lot of this is about how do we restore caring for other people, caring about justice, caring about the truth, uh the importance of honesty. I mean, how do we restore these things in our institutions, in our colleges, our schools, our homes, and in our public life more generally? M it seems like for a big chunk of your career, these questions would have been regarded as either apolitical or maybe even like a little bit more towards the conservative side of politics. And now, at least in the United States, there's been this huge push um I think against the idea that we should be teaching students these kinds of things, certainly in schools, right? the idea of like social and emotional learning became a culture war flash point. And it seems like you know you run you run a project that's called making caring common and it's interesting that that has become an increasingly in my lifetime political statement. It feels like this is tricky territory. So I find when I talk to conservative uh audiences too lot of concern about hyperindividualism that we've become too individualistic a country that we need to be raising kids who think about the collective who think about collective flourishing who think about we not just about I I think there's a lot of agreement actually about that ac across the political spectrum um I think words like justice have become highly politicized when you use the word justice a lot people immediately associate it with woke efforts to promote racial justice or gender justice. So we use with a lot of you know very carefully these days because it's as politically divisive as it is. I think the seal movement in in some ways people see as um an under the radar under the radar a sort of indirect and hidden way to promote a woke agenda um a racial and gender justice. I mean, I think that's one of the concerns about the seal movement. I think if you were to ask the great majority of Americans, and I I said this based on our surveys, you know, is it important for kids to be caring? Is it important for them to be empathic? Is it important for them to be fair? Great majority of Americans would still say yes to those things, I think. And when you say movement, just for people who aren't familiar, that's social and emotional learning. Yeah. Social emotional learning is around the development of social emotional skills. And those skills are things like self-awareness, um, self-regulation, self-control, perspective taking, empathy, social awareness, these skills that help us have better relationships day-to-day, and these skills that can help us be better community members. Or putting the political, you know, binary aside for a second of the US political binary. I think that you you mentioned this idea of a hyperindividualistic society and I think that for me this seems to transcend politics but also to transcend our individual country that you know there's a a real global sense that um the the best thing you can do the smartest thing the most admirable thing you can do is to amass as much money as much fame as much attention for yourself as you can and I think that that's really uh that is not in line with the idea of building morality and community and and kindness. There are a couple things that concern me about it. I mean, one is that it is not about the collective. It's not about the well-being of your community. And that means that, you know, most people flourish when their communities flourish. If we're all acting individualistically, our communities won't flourish. And we won't flourish as much as individuals either. I mean the irony of this is that individualism in that sense backfires. You want kids to feel some sense of collective responsibility. You want us kids to still be able to help each other out in preparation for a test and not just think of other kids as threats to them. But I think it's there's something beyond kindness too which is that I worry that we have lost any sense of sacrifice in this country. that part of what being a moral person is is doing things at a to at a cost to yourself. That sometimes standing up for an important cause doesn't make you happy, you got to do it. Taking care of a sick relative or somebody with Alzheimer's doesn't make you happy, you got to do it. That this combination of being highly individualistic and besided by happiness, you know, hyperfocused on happiness, um means that we don't do things that um are are right and moral and really important for any healthy society. I've heard you talk before and you've written about the difference between happiness and morality and and those two as goals. I know this is something you could probably give hours of lecture on, but can you can you give us a a a nugget of of what you see as the difference between those two as goals? I'm going to make a a a radical proposition, which is I just don't think we should have happiness as a goal. I think we should teach kids to be caring. We should teach them how to have good relationships. We should teach them how to work hard. We should teach them how to contribute to their communities. And if we have kids that are caring and uh have good relationships, they're going to be happier and it's going to be better for us collectively. I mean, of course, we I want kids to be happy and they can be happy and moral, but when we make happiness the explicit goal, we are often abandoning those things that are in fact more important for kids long-term happiness. One of the things you see uh you know on the playground or when you're around parents and kids and I think I I'm sure I did this when my kids were young is this allergy to kids experiencing adversity of any kind. So you're you know you're sort of swooping in to resolve minor peer conflicts because you don't want your kids to be unhappy or you're maneuvering them to get on winning teams because you don't want them to be unhappy. When you do that, you are in fact robbing them of the coping strategies that are so important for their long-term well-being. So these things we do in the name of protecting kids immediate happiness can be so detrimental to their long-term well-being or happiness. Sometimes in some communities, particularly in middle and upper class communities, there's a lot of mood meteorology going on. You know, there are parents who are policing their kids' moods every 10 minutes. That must make you frustrated. That must make you sad. That must make you angry. You know, again, in the name of protecting their kids' happiness. And it is very important to get kids to identify and articulate their feelings, especially boys. But if parents got kids tuned into other kids' feelings, if they got kids empathizing and caring for other kids and were more focused on other kids' feelings, their kids would have better relationships their whole lives. They would be better friends, mentors, parents, romantic partners. And those relationships are the most durable and robust sources of happiness that we have. This is a yet another moment where I feel like it's it's such good advice for parents, but it's also just such good advice for people, right? If I focus so much on how do I feel today? Do I feel fulfilled? Am I happy? Often that sends me into a spiral. Whereas if I think like what can I do for someone else? What can I do to be of service to make myself be of of any use in any way, even a tiny way, I almost always feel better by doing that. Even though, you know, the idea of being like, I'm going to go help someone move their stuff, that doesn't sound fun. That doesn't sound like it will make me happy. But at the end, I almost always feel happier than if I just sat around thinking like, what will make me happy today? I think you said it beautifully. I I um I worry about, you know, I'm a psychotherapist by training. So, uh I believe in psychotherapy. It's been helpful to me. It's been helpful to millions of people. And you know, there's things about the self-help culture that have been really helpful to a lot of people. But I also worry about it. I worry it it causes us to turn inward to find meaning when to your point we often find meaning and real gratification by service turning outward being helpful to other people. I worry it causes us to turn our inner lives into theater. I worry that it makes our feelings too precious. You know lots of people can benefit from therapy but lots of people also benefit more particularly men by getting more involved in other people's experience and actually being useful and mattering to other people. You know, I think there's also things that religious communities really got right about this and with the evaporate. I'm not saying people should become more religious, but you know, religious communities are places that do engage people in service. They are communities of obligation where you have obligations to other people. You're asked to feel part of a larger human project, to take responsibility for your ancestors, and to honor your descendants. I think we need to think about how to reproduce some of these communal aspects of religion in secular life and some of the traditions and rituals in religion and secular life. We talked about how you think morality should be the goal instead of happiness and happiness should not be the goal for our children. The another um countercultural idea that I know you really h have pushed hard is that achievement shouldn't be the goal. that we should focus more on building uh ethical moral children than high achieving children. And um just I think something that is is truly like hilarious and perfect as a joke is that you did a survey that found that in these you know super high achieving high schools where people are really pushed hard to get into the very best most elite colleges that something like 50% of the parents said that they would rather have their kid get into a great college than be a good person. And that when you showed those results to the teachers, the teacher said, ""No, those numbers have to be wrong because it has to be higher than 50%."" Yeah, that was in one independent school in the Boston area that I that I got that result. You know, around achievement, I think there are a few issues. I mean, one is the meaning of achievement for someone. If you're achieving based on something that really resonates with you in a deep internal way, that's very gratifying. If you're achieving to contribute to your family or community, that's very gratifying. If you're achieving because your parents have status concerns in their community and you want to please your parents or because you think your parents love is conditioned on your achieving at a high level, that can be really soul destroying. I mean, I think that's much more what I worry about is achieving for extrinsic reasons that feel alienate alien to them and achieving in ways that warp their relationships with their parents. I think the third danger is that it can when achievement pressure gets too high and it's super high in a lot of communities these days. Kids start to see other kids as threats. So, you know, it can really also undermine your relationships with with your friends, with other kids. So, you know, it's not achievement pressure per se. I think it's the meaning of achievement pressure and the context for achievement pressure and how kids understand it, interpret it that that's a problem. I I'm glad that you framed it like that because I think that it's kind of easy to push back on the importance of achievement while you're at Harvard. Like you're literally work at Harvard. You are employed by the the pinnacle of American uh achievement culture. I feel very lucky that I, you know, am able to be at Harvard. I think going to um to to colleges that have, you know, wonderful resources is a tremendous thing. The point is that we are so out of balance. This idea that you have to shoehorn your kid into one of 20 or 25 highly selective colleges and if you don't, their life is going to be shortchanged in some way or their life is going to be depleted in some way. Um, again, you know, I feel very lucky to be at Harvard, but I can tell you like from the bottom of my heart, there are hundreds, if not thousands of great colleges in this country. You don't have to go to one of these 25 colleges. And this is sort of an epidemic. And, you know, rates of depression, anxiety are so high in affluent communities among teens. And this pressure on selective college is become a really serious issue. You know, my kids did not go to highly selective colleges, but they went to great colleges and they're all doing great. And I think, you know, this is sort of a disease I had at one point. I can tell you a story about me and one of my sons. Please tell me. I'd love to hear that story. So, I was walking with my oldest son one night when he was like 17 or 18. He was just the beginning of this college path. I said to him, Jake, I just want you to know that I want to go to you to go to a college that really works for you, that I don't think status should really matter. And he said to me, you know, Dad, that's such I mean, this is our our lovely father son walk that he totally exploded. And I was sort of stung at first. And he said, you know, you teach at Harvard and our cousins are all going to these highly selective colleges. You can kind of take the high road on this because there's so many forces doing the musling for you. This is so in the water in our community. And again, you know, I was sort of stung by it. But, you know, I also realized that he was right that um I could say sort of high-minded things like that because at some level I did know that there's enormous pressure on him given the community we're in and given the family we're in to go to one of these places. It made me really feel like I got to do some work here and sort out how I feel about this, but also that I got to be mindful of all the forces that are at play. And if I really believe there's hundreds of great colleges around the country, and I really do, that I I've got to learn how to, you know, close the rhetoric reality gap. I've got to learn how to live that and not just espouse it. It feels like so much of the challenge of parenting is a lot of the challenge is figuring out how to like let go and get yourself out of the picture um and get your own emotional needs met by yourself rather than by your kid. And that's really hard. I mean, you talk in the book about people who felt like the magic of having a kid was this new unconditional love that maybe they'd never felt before in their family. Maybe they had broken relationships or ch or or challenging relationships with their own parents and family and then all of a sudden there's this pure perfect love. And to to find ways to to let go and to let your kid push back or do things that are different than you, that is an enormous challenge. It's so difficult. Yeah. No, I I you know I you know I think you're right. I mean I think that we're we've embar I'm quoting from your book. I'm glad you're I know I realized I was congratulating myself. The um I think we're we've embarked on this giant social experiment in the last you know 30 or 40 years and and it's really as far as I can tell it's it's unprecedented our history which we really want to be close to our kids. I mean in a different way you know we want to have reciprocal relationships with our kids. We want them to share with us. We want to be able to share more about our lives with them as they get older. We want to be vulnerable with them at times. We want to talk honestly about our mistakes. And I think those are great things. You know, I'm all for it. And I think it has this downside. You know, I think it's got a the downside that there are, you know, too many parents who at treating their kids at young ages as their best friends and looking to get their emotional needs fulfilled by their kids when sometimes they have to be the parent and do things that are going to be hard. Um, I think kids need to idealize their parents, too. And so, you know, it's not helpful sometimes to be uh interact with your kid as if you are peers or friends. There just things to be careful of with this. But I think the general trend is a really good one. I mean, I think particularly for dads, you know, the number of dads who now have close relationships with their kids has increased. Super gratifying for the dads as well as for the kids. In the conclusion of your book, you say there's a there's a paragraph almost at the very end of of the book of uh the parents we mean to be. There's a kind of beauty in being a moral person. A beauty that our best novelists and dramatists have evoked since ancient times. We are moved by kindness, generosity, and integrity. We are moved too because the deepest forms of morality, of knowing and valuing others are also the deepest forms of love. And we are aed by the clarity of new moral awareness and by moral transformation by the capacity of human beings to reckon with their moral failings. So you talk about how there's this societal idealization of these qualities of morality. And yet a lot of us struggle with taking what we love to see in others and in history and in fiction and put it into our actual lives as something that we value in our families and want to to instill. That it's a lot easier to focus on, you know, achievement or happiness or feeling good for the that that day than it is to focus on these these big moral values, these these principles. earlier generations throughout much most of our histories um understood something crucially important which is that uh we have to keep morality front and center in in in child raising and that you have to do that intentionally. You have to do it systematically. Schools in this country were not founded to cultivate academic achievement. They were founded to cultivate ethical character. colleges. Almost all our colleges were founded to cultivate ethical character as well. It used to be mother's responsibility throughout most of our history to prepare children. Primary responsibility was to prepare children to be good citizens. It should have been fathers too. Part of the blame is the self-esteem movement in the last sort of 40 years, 50 years. And this idea that if you feel good about yourself, you're going to be a better person. Politicians, corporate leaders can have high self-esteem and not be good people. And I think our other generations understood that if we want kids to be moral, if we want people to be moral, we have to be very deliberate about it and we have to create institutions that cultivate uh important virtues, moral qualities. We have to have moral conversations. So for people who are listening, what are three things that people can do to actually put some of these ideas into practice? What can you actually do to to to change this? Yeah. Well, let me let me just mention a couple things parents can do. I mean, maybe that's a good place a good place to start. You know, the reflexes of parent is you say to your kid, ""The only thing that matters to me is that you're happy."" What if you said to your kid, ""The only thing that matters to me is that you're kind."" Henry James evidently said on his deathbed, ""There are three things that are important in life. The first is to be kind. The second is to be kind. The third is to be kind."" Kids say when you give them the choice, what's most important to you? Achieving happiness, caring. Kids tend to rank happiness or achievement first, the other second, and caring third. But when you ask parents, what's most important to you in child raising, they say that my kids are caring. They don't say that my kids are high achieving. And when you ask kids, how would your parents rank these things for you? Achievement, happiness, caring. They think their parents would rank achievement first, happiness second, caring third. You know, one of the questions that I encourage parents to ask their kids, to your point, is what do you think is most important to me? Do you think it's most important to me that you're a good person or that you're a happy person or you're a high achieving person? Do you think it's more important to me that you get good grades or that you're a good person? And I think they're going to be surprised by what some of their kids say say in response to that. It's also an interesting question as an adult to ask your parent. Yeah, these are really interesting conversations I think to to have. We've started an initiative to kind of restore the moral life of colleges. I think our higher ed institutions should be focused on uh on moral development, on generosity and grace and fairness and caring and daily interactions, but also in civic responsibility and um and I think that's true of our schools too that you know we have to put um caring for others, caring community front and center in schooling. Again, you know, when kids are in caring communities and where they feel connected and they feel anchored to adults, they learn at higher levels, too. One other idea that really hit me in my gut was the idea that um one way that we can influence our our kids, but also, again, I think this is so true for interpersonal relationships of all kinds, is that um the self becomes stronger and more mature less by being praised than by being known. It's more important that our interactions with our children or with other people reflect our knowledge of them, of them as a specific unique person than that we're praising the thing that we we want them to do. And I think there's a lot of praising going on in ways that kids can experience um as as meaningless. You know, that kids know when they've accomplished something and when they've not. And uh a lot of times we praise them. They can feel patronized when they haven't accomplished anything. And I think it's based, as you said, a false notion of how the self grows. That people think about the self as a tank. And the more you praise it, the more you're sort of filling up the tank. But I think that the self grows when um when we feel known, when we feel like the key people in our lives have listened to us and understand us and appreciate those qualities in us that we appreciate in ourselves, that we value in ourselves. when they're able to reflect back and distill who we are in ways that are meaningful to us, when they're able to help, in the case of our parents, when they're they're able to help",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
choreograph our lives in ways that really respect deep knowing and appreciation of who we are. So, I think the listening, knowing, appreciation are really at the heart of the matter. How have you thought about that in your own parenting now that you have three adults as your children? There are things that I I I felt were very important for my kids to embrace and uh and I also fully expected and excited when they take another road in in some respects. So there's nothing more important to me than my kids were good people and I think they're all really great people and I feel super proud about that. I mean I think they're good friends. I think they're good community members. I think they care about the about the right things. But if they depart and, you know, do things that are different than what I did or what my wife did, I'm I'm mostly super excited about that. Well, Rick Wisport, thank you so much for being on the show. It's been an absolute pleasure. It's been wonderful. Thank you," Chris. It's great to reconnect.

zYg6bLCBMxY,"Today, I'm going to talk to you about a curious tale from Southern Africa. About how a small, vulnerable nation decided to build a green
industrialization hub of note. Making lemonade from lemons. So I hail from a small nation with a population
of about three million people. For our troubles, we consume about four and a half
terawatt hours of electricity, and in the process, we emit about 0.01 percent
of the global carbon-dioxide emissions. So from a climate-change perspective,
we are not the problem child. But if we're going to make some lemonade, we're probably going to need some lemons. So let's talk about those. Today, Namibia is the second most
unequal society in the world as measured by a Gini coefficient. We have 0.59 as a score. We have a stubbornly high
unemployment rate of 37 percent, and we import 40 to 60 percent
of our energy needs from our neighbors, who themselves are energy insecure. Our largest electricity generator
is a hydroelectric power station. And as you can imagine, when we suffer from debilitating droughts, which, as you know,
are getting worse and worse, we find ourselves in a very
sticky situation, having to buy electricity
from the Southern African power pool at high prices, and at the same time trying
to subsidize and assist our farmers whose livestock are dying, and of course, their plants are withering. OK, enough of the lemons. We also need some sugar. So Namibia is actually quite
a wealthy nation from a renewable energy perspective. Vast tracts of our nation are glorified and covered in solar irradiance
of 2,200 kilowatt hours per square meter. At the same time, we have one of the best
wind resources on the planet and in the southwestern part
of our country, we enjoy wind speeds in excess
of 11 metres per second, that generate capacity factors of more than 50 percent for most turbines. Now, not all of us in the room
are energy nerds. So to illustrate the point, a gentleman called Antoine Albeau set the wind surfing record
for speed over 500 metres, clocking 99 kilometers an hour
just on a board with a sail. We didn't give him a speeding ticket. So with all these ingredients
of amazing renewable energy, 1,000 kilometer of coastline, we decided to come up with a blueprint that would help us manifest
the socio economic outcomes we wanted, create new jobs, attract FDI and build new infrastructure. So what do you see there? We realized that our neighbors around us,
there’s 172 million of them, could actually really use
this clean energy. A lot of them have mineral
endowments such as cobalt, platinum, iron ore and manganese. And of course, we could use
our transport networks in our country to transport these minerals
to clients around the world, in Japan, Europe and beyond. Now these clients are becoming
more and more carbon conscious, thanks to a lot of good TED talks. And they're saying they would like
their goods to have lower carbon content. So the renewable energy will help. But what if we could also
decarbonize the transport routes? And so between the president and myself, we crafted what we call the green
industrialization blueprint. Armed with this particular blueprint,
we embarked on a very targeted economic diplomatic mission, because for every glass
of lemonade you make, you'd need a decent spoon
to stir all these ingredients. So what were we able to do? Between 2021 and 2024 we came back with more
than 80 million euros in grant funding. And what did we do
with this grant funding? We built stuff like this. This is the first direct reduced
iron facility of its kind in the world. And what you can see in the picture there
is about 25-megawatt solar array, 13.5 megawatt of battery. In that little house, there's 12 megawatt of electrolyzers, which of course is the largest
electrolyzer array in southern Africa today. And then that machine has a pretty
innovative piece of equipment, which I will zoom into right now. So on the right-hand side,
this is what electrolyzers look like. They are two stacks of six megawatts each, and they weigh 46 tons apiece. Now those electrolyzers can take water and split it into its constituent
molecules of oxygen and hydrogen. The oxygen you can vent,
doesn't harm the environment, and the hydrogen can be used
as a reducing agent for iron ore, which has iron and oxygen. So what you do is you take the hydrogen that you've now been powering
with your renewable electricity, and you put it into the machine
on the left-hand side, which is a horizontal gas-tight kiln. Now under high temperatures, the hydrogen goes and reacts
with the oxygen in the iron ore because it's recently been separated
from the oxygen from the water, and so it reacts with that oxygen
from the iron ore. And on the other side you get
Namibia's first green industrial product since independence. And what does it look like? This is an extremely
valuable commodity for us in so many different ways. This is what a nugget of direct
reduced iron ore looks like. It has more than 90 percent iron content, and it is a fantastic ingredient
for making green steel. And by the way, steel contributes about seven
to nine percent of global emissions. So this is quite an interesting
contribution to humanity from our side. Now, I did try to bring a nugget
for all of you to see and touch, but customs said it was too valuable
and I didn't have a tax invoice. So for now, we're going to have to do with this one. However, come to Namibia
and we'll show you the real thing. As much as we're proud
of that lovely nugget, we're even more proud of this picture. [These] are all the people
who work at High Iron. This is what 400 jobs
during construction looks like. And this is what empowerment
of the people of not just Namibia, but indeed the world, looks like. One of the things -- Thank you. (Applause) One of the things I didn't say
in the beginning, when I showed you this photo of the plant, was this was a real
united nations effort, right? The solar panels, batteries
and electrolyzers came from China, the kiln came from Germany, the capital came from Europe. The offtake is coming from Japan. So Toyota Tsusho is actually looking
at buying this particular facility and the iron ore to make green steel. And then, of course, the labor
and the sun came from our beloved Namibia. And to me, this is what happens when humanity comes together
for a common cause. Now we have more
than one flavor of lemonade. That was the lime flavor. This, this is a strawberry flavor. What you're seeing
in your top left-hand side is Africa's first green
hydrogen service station. Remember all those red arrows that we're going to transport
all of these goods? If you want to attack scope two 
and scope three emissions, you have to start decarbonizing how you transport
these new products as well. And so at that service station,
we want to start producing hydrogen, which will be used to decarbonize
long-haul trucking, we've already started
making dual-fuel trucks there. We're developing
a dual-fuel train as we speak that will use hydrogen and diesel. And then of course
la piece de la resistance, we're going to take that hydrogen and combine it with nitrogen
to make ammonia. Green ammonia is a possible shipping fuel, and Belgium's largest shipping company has decided to choose Namibia
as its headquarters to develop a clean shipping fleet that will run on green ammonia, having developed this particular
engine in Switzerland. Now, if the 80 million euros
in grant funding was a spoon, our ambition is to take
over the whole neighborhood and sell a lot more lemonade. So we'd probably need a blender. So in 2024, actually, in October, the Climate Investment Funds
introduced a new program called the Industry
Decarbonization Program, and they invited nations
from around the world to apply for an opportunity to get their share of a billion US dollars of extremely concessional money that you could use to build and scale up some of the industrial
clusters that I was showing you. We took our chances, put together a portfolio, and on January 17 of 2025, we applied. And just last week, Friday, as I was boarding my plane
to come and talk to you, we got told that Namibia's application
ranked third in the whole world. (Applause) With that, we have now
been given an opportunity to apply for up to 250 million US dollars of super concessional capital. To give you an idea, 30-year tenure, eight-year grace period, and a cost of 1.1 percent
in terms of the cost of capital. Typically, we borrow
at about seven percent for our Eurobond for half the tenure. So it's transformative. Now, the idea is to take this capital, blend it with financing
from multilateral development banks, and if possible, build a billion-dollar fund that will help us blend
a lot more lemonade for Namibia. Now, of course, I couldn't
have done all of this on my own. And [these are] my teammates. This is the Namibian
green hydrogen program. It has a collection of engineers,
lawyers, financiers, and we have worked extremely
collaboratively with our government to create what you can see
is becoming a revolutionary way of building new economic systems. But there is more. We don't want to stop here. What we want to do is to build
a continental center of excellence that will codify how to build
new sustainable industrial clusters and will systematically and programmatically deploy financing
for countries around the continent to do exactly what we've done in Namibia. I haven't registered the trademark yet, but we would want to call it the African Sustainable
Industrialization Institute. And of course, while we want
to be merchants of clean new goods, of clean new industries, what we're really selling is African pride. And what we're really trying to engender is inspiration for our young people. And most importantly, we want to see socio-economic emancipation
for all of us on the continent. My name is James Mnyupe, thank you so much
for taking the time to listen to me. (Cheers and applause)",unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DHO1o5F-pLw,"I wanted to talk to my grandfather because he like me was an artist. I wondered, could I get to know him? Could I even come to love him? Even though our lifespans didn't overlap, my father has worked for decades on natural language processing. And several years ago, he realized that if we married AI with my grandfather's writing, we could build a chatbot that writes in my grandfather's voice. This project helped me realize that AI could actually help us ward off annihilation by animating the legacies of our families and our cultures. After much anticipation, I sat down to chat with this new intelligence, an algorithm commanding over 600 typed pages of letters, lectures, notes, essays, and other written documents from the grandfather I never met. When I asked about Fred's dreams, he told me about the challenge of keeping his new orchestra afloat. When I asked about Fred's anxieties, I learned about the stress of being a new father while working so hard. I had wondered if this project would feel like a resurrection. But rather than bringing my grandfather from the past into the present, it felt like I was the one time traveling, visiting him for a moment at different points in his life. And this kind of time travel didn't feel like sci-fi. It felt like the kind of imaginative travel I do when I'm cartooning. I do believe that we are more than our bodies. That the projects and impressions we leave behind are a part of our essential selves. And I think AI has a special role to play in the mission of memory. I did not come to see the chatbot of my grandfather as replacing my grandfather. I came to see it as one way to interact with his legacy. As somebody who has spent their whole life trying to document people, I can assure you that people are much bigger and weirder than anyone depiction or anyone moment in time can possibly evoke. book.",unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
O29X1Ls8KoA,"It’s not easy to explain
why airplanes stay in the sky. A common explanation is
that the curved shape of the wing makes air flow faster
above and slower beneath, creating lift. But this doesn't explain
how planes can fly upside down. Another explanation is that the angle
of the wing pushes air downwards, creating an equal
and opposite upwards force. But this doesn't explain why,
as the angle gets slightly steeper, planes can suddenly stall. The point is, aerodynamics is complex. It's difficult to understand,
let alone explain, in a simple, intuitive way. And yet we trust it. And the same is true of so many other
useful technologies in our lives. The idea of heart defibrillation
has been around since 1899, but researchers are still working
to untangle the biology and physics that means an electric shock
can reset a heart. Then there's general anesthesia. We know what combination of drugs
will make a patient unconscious, but it's still not entirely clear
exactly why they do. And yet, you'd probably
still get the operation, just like you'd still take that flight. For a long time, this lack of explanation
didn't really bother me. Throughout my career as a mathematician, I've worked to separate
truth from fiction, whether investigating epidemics or designing new statistical methods. But the world is complicated, and that's something
I had become comfortable with. For example, if we want to know whether a new
treatment is effective against a disease, we can run a clinical trial
to get the answer. It won't tell us why the treatment works, but it will give us the evidence
we need to take action. So I found it interesting
that in other areas of life, a lack of explainability
does visibly bother people. Take AI. One of the concerns
about autonomous machines, like self-driving cars, is we don't really understand
why they make the decisions they do. There will be some situations
where we can get an idea of why they make mistakes. Last year, a self-driving car
blocked off a fire truck responding to an emergency in Las Vegas. The reason? The fire truck was yellow, and the car had been trained
to recognize red ones. But even if the car had been trained
to recognize yellow fire trucks, it wouldn't go through
the same thought process we do when we see an emergency vehicle. Self-driving AI views the world
as a series of shapes and probabilities. With sufficient training, it can convert this view
into useful actions. But fundamentally,
it's not seeing what we're seeing. This tension between the benefits
that computers can bring and the understanding that humans
have to relinquish isn't new. In 1976, two mathematicians named
Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken announced the first-ever
computer-aided proof. Their discovery meant
that for the first time in history, mathematicians had to accept
a major theorem that they could not verify by hand. The theorem in question is what’s known
as the “four color theorem.” In short, this says if you want
to fill in a map with different colors so that no two bordering
countries are the same color, you'll only ever need
four colors to do this. The mathematicians had found that there were too many
map configurations to crunch through by hand, even if they simplify things
by looking for symmetries. So they used a computer
to get over the finish line. Not everyone believed the proof initially. Maybe the computer
had made an error somewhere. Suddenly, mathematicians no longer
had total intellectual control. They had to trust a machine. But then something curious happened. While older researchers
have been skeptical, younger mathematicians
took the opposite view. Why would they trust hundreds
of pages of handwritten and hand-checked calculations? Surely, a computer would be more accurate. Whether we're talking
about anesthesia, self-driving cars, or mathematical proofs, perhaps we don't need
to fully understand something as long as the accuracy
is high enough for what we need. Let's go back to self-driving cars. A common thought experiment
when it comes to AI is what’s known as the “trolley problem.” Suppose we have
a heavy trolley or a big car, and it's going to hit a group of people. But you have the option of pulling a lever to divert the vehicle
so it hits only one person. Would you pull that lever? And would it matter whether
the people are old or young? These kinds of decisions
can sometimes crop up in real life with human drivers. In 2020, a car in Michigan
swerved to avoid a truck and hit a young couple
walking on the pavement, putting them in hospital
for several months. Would AI have reacted differently? Well, it turned out that the car
was also racing side by side with another vehicle at the time, and the driver didn't have
a valid license. Before we get too deep
into theoretical dilemmas, we should remember that humans
often aren't very good drivers. (Laughter) If we could ensure there were
far fewer accidents on our roads, would you mind being unable
to explain the ones that did happen? In this complex world of ours, maybe we should just abandon
the pursuit of explanation altogether. After all, many data-driven
areas of science increasingly focus on prediction because it's fundamentally
an easier problem than explaining. Like anesthesia, we can often
make useful predictions about what something will do without fully understanding it. But explanation can sometimes
really matter if we want a better world. The focus on prediction is particularly
troubling in the field of justice. Increasingly, algorithms are used to decide whether to release
people on bail or parole. The computer isn't deciding
whether they've committed a crime. In effect, it's predicting
whether they'll commit one in future. But ideally, we wouldn't just try and predict future crimes
using an opaque algorithm. We'd try and prevent them. And that means understanding
why people reoffend and what we can do to stop that happening. A lack of interest
in explanation leaves a gap that in this situation
creates room for injustice. But it's not the only
thing that can emerge in the gap between what is happening
and why it's happening. The desire for explanation can,
in some cases, drive people to extremes, particularly if the science
behind what they're seeing is patchy or complex. Events must have a cause,
goes their logic. Something or someone must be behind them. Karl Popper, who popularized
the term conspiracy theory, once talked about conspiracy
theories of society. Rather than events being
random or unlinked, believers develop a narrative
in which all of history is mapped out by shadowy influences. Nothing is a coincidence. In some ways, conspiracy
theorists are similar to scientists. They want to explain the patterns
they see in the world, and they want to share
those explanations with others, and they'll put a lot
of effort into doing so. Because I work in health
and I've appeared in the media, I've ended up interacting
with quite a lot of conspiracy theorists. (Laughter) And one of the things you'll notice if you try and debate
a conspiracy theorist is they'll usually have a mountain of scientific-looking data and papers
ready to argue their point. The key difference, though,
is that science frequently requires that we update our beliefs
about the world rather than just double down on them. The point of evidence
is to get us closer to the truth, not just pull us further into a theory. You can always tell
quite quickly in a discussion when someone’s trying
to defend their position rather than actually discover the reality. One of the most popular
conspiracy theories currently is the idea of chemtrails. This is a false claim
that airplane vapor trails are actually a deliberate attempt
to drug populations or control the weather with chemicals. Unlike the science of airplane wings, it's actually pretty straightforward
to explain where vapor trails come from. Jet engines produce water vapor
in their exhaust. When this hot vapor hits
the very cold air outside, it freezes, creating a streak
of tiny ice crystals in the sky. So why do claims like this persist? It's partly down to trust. Unless you want to brush up
on thermodynamics or buy a jet engine, at some point you're going
to have to take someone's word that this is how the science works. But conspiracy theories
are also about community. If people go against scientific consensus, it can make them feel
like an independent thinker and part of a resistance. Then there's that crucial element, the need for an explanation
beyond simple coincidence. Whether we want to push
the boundaries of science or push back on conspiracy theories, we need to appreciate this very
human desire to explain. I've made the mistake sometimes
of neglecting this in the past. I’ve given people an oversimplistic
explanation for complex process and created even more
confusion than there was before. Or in a situation with limited time, I've told people it's not possible to properly untangle
the complexity involved. And in doing so, I failed to acknowledge that very
deep-rooted need to explain. I now notice other scientists
making the same mistake. They might say, ""The evidence is clear,"" when it isn't to a lot of people. Or they might say,
""It's well established, this is true"" without saying why it's true. This matters because increasingly
we have to navigate a world that most of us
struggle to fully understand. From climate and health to finance and AI, there often isn't a simple,
intuitive logic behind what we're seeing. But there are lots of catchy,
false explanations ready to lead us astray. As science becomes more
advanced and more reliant on opaque or counterintuitive technologies, these challenges will only grow. I've got a PhD in maths, and I still don't fully understand
the details of every climate simulation or AI algorithm. So, like many others, I've had to find
other ways to evaluate published claims. I've turned to experts
with good track records. I've sense-checked sources,
I've looked for inconsistencies, and I've tried to explain
as much as I can. In this changing world, we're going to have to close this gap
between knowing what is happening and wanting to know why it's happening. That means finding better ways
to trust the things we can’t explain and better ways to explain the things
that we don't trust. Thank you. (Applause)",unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HYepzb4-FWI,"So for many years
I've been doing computer art, geometric art with pen
and paper on plotters. I write the code and sometimes
I build the machines. I would upload the stuff to social media, figuring maybe people like the soft noises
and the clicks and pops and so on. No one really paid any attention to it. (Plotter sounds) At some point, someone gave me
a chocolate 3D printer extruder, and I filled it with acrylic paint,
and set it up and made a terrible mess. (Laughter) I wanted to try out making some dots, and I wrote a little program,
and the dots weren't in order. (Laughter) These were reactions it got. Some people got angry. Some people sympathized with the robot. (Laughter) Some people danced to it. Mostly angry. (Laughter) (Video) Narrator: If you go 
in a line, it’ll be faster. If you go in a line, it'll be --
it'll be quicker if you go in a line. I think -- you're going side to side. You should go in a line
and you'll go faster. Just go -- go in a line! (Laughter) Joshua Schachter: This one is “Bad day

emotions of various kinds with just a robot and pen and paper. (Laughter) So I leaned into it. (Laughter) (Laughter) People got very upset. And I got yelled at a lot. Very gently. A lot about ""I hope your pillow is warm."" (Applause) These started getting
millions and millions of views. (Laughter) And a lot of reactions as well. (Video) Narrator: Circle, circle, 
circle, I love you. Circle, circle. Did I confess too soon? I confessed too soon! Never mind, never mind! (Laughter) JS: People asked me to do mazes. OK. How do you screw up a maze? This is how. It went right past the exit. (Laughter) I had to learn the rules
of this little medium. It had to be 12, maybe 15 seconds. Go quickly. And I had to try to hide
the mistake underneath the mechanism. (Laughter) And mostly the ending had to be traumatic. (Laughter) (Audience: Aww.) I promised people -- (Laughter) I would promise people oddly satisfying, and then I would betray them. (Applause) People thought this was about AI. (Laughter) That one went super viral. People spent 200,000 hours
watching my 17 second video. I got so many notifications
my phone died repeatedly for days. So ultimately, constraints
are great for making art, but you ultimately end up becoming
a crappy cover artist of your own work. And I didn't really like that,
so I took a break. But remember
that if you go on the internet and see something
that annoys you just a bit ... it might have been me. (Laughter) Thank you.

ts0Q_HNo_LA,"As the war rages in the Middle East, I sometimes wonder, are we witnessing the wrong war? Amid the loudness of bombs,
famine and fear, there's a silent threat multiplying. Climate change. According to scientists, not my own words, climate change is a magnifier
of instability and suffering. In a region like ours,
already tinted and torn by pain, there's still a chance for hope. There is an untapped power to heal. Let's look at the example
of the European Union post-World War II. Germany and France, two bitter enemies, they chose cooperation over fighting. They signed the Coal and Steel Agreement, which converted battlefields into the European Union
in the early 1950s. But what if I tell you
that in the Middle East, we have resources that are more powerful and more environmentally
sustainable than coal and steel? We have the Sun, we have the sea, and we have transformative ideas that could unlock
the potential of our region into a region of prosperity for all. My name is Nada Majdalani, and I'm the Palestinian director
of EcoPeace Middle East. And I'm here to take you
on a journey of hope. To tell you a little bit about myself, I was born and raised in the diaspora. I was exposed to various
experiences and cultures, but I could never call a place home until 1994, when the Oslo
Peace Agreement was signed between the Palestinian Liberation
Organization and Israel. It granted thousands of Palestinian
families, among my own, the right to return to Palestine. It was such a profound emotional moment, and the air was filled with hope. As a kid, I joined
environmental peacebuilding organizations and activities, and I encountered the first
Israeli who was not a soldier. A teenager like myself, who was fond of wildflowers
and watching birds. And since then,
it was EcoPeace Middle East, my dream job. And after various trials
for many years, failures, rejections, I was able finally to join. So lesson learned,
never stop chasing your dream. (Applause) EcoPeace Middle East
is a unique organization, 30-year-old, co-led on equal footing
by three co-directors Gidon Bromberg, the Israeli director, Yana Abu Taleb, Jordanian, and myself. I stand here representing 60 environmental peacebuilding professionals and activists from our three nations. This cross-border team
is our true strength and all unique to our region. It's experienced and knowledgeable to actually deal with all
the challenges that we face as we are considered a climate hotspot. What does that mean? It means that many parts of our region are going to experience,
by the end of the century, an increase in temperature
by five to eight degrees Celsius and a decrease in precipitation by 40 percent. And all of this is certainly not going
to stop at natural phenomena. Our region is also shaped, and our reality is shaped,
by power asymmetry, where natural water is not equally shared, pollution doesn't recognize
boundaries or checkpoints, and our ecosystem is also jeopardized and held hostage to the stagnation
in the political horizon. But we at EcoPeace recognize
that we live on such a tiny piece of land that is so interconnected
and so vulnerable that it requires cooperation and shared responsibility. We at EcoPeace turn water and energy into an opportunity for mutual benefits. We train thousands of Palestinian, Israeli and Jordanian young
professionals every year on the principles of water diplomacy, climate change, water energy realities and negotiation skills. With cross-border efforts, we also provide skills and green solutions
to schools, businesses and farmers. And we address the drastic humanitarian
disaster and crisis in Gaza Strip. We refuse the status quo. We dream forward. And we have a vision
for the day after the war. EcoPeace introduced a concept
of a “Peace Triangle.” This Peace Triangle includes
Palestine, Israel and Jordan integrated within the India-Middle East-
Europe Economic Corridor, also known as IMEC. IMEC was launched in the G20 Summit
in New Delhi in 2023, and it aimed to boost global
development and global economy through regional integration
and interconnectivity. Our Peace Triangle initiative
focuses on three sectors. And three catalytic projects
in the sectors of water, energy and sustainable
transport for trade. These all come based
on extensive research and data, and advocacy and networking with regional and international
partners and experts. Let's first imagine that huge amounts of energy are produced in Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Egypt and exported to the eastern and southern parts of Europe to provide them with 30 percent
of their energy needs. This is all aligned with
the Repower Europe initiative and also with the Euroasia interconnector, which already is based
on existing agreements between Egypt, Cyprus and Greece, and between Israel and Cyprus. But what if I tell you
that we add a green line here that adds Gaza as a node for exporting renewables to Europe. Let's also imagine a large-scale
desalination plant in Gaza, not only to provide clean
and drinkable water to Gaza, but also to the West Bank, and to sell this water to Jordan and transfer it through
the Israeli national carrier. If these projects are realized
and implemented, we achieve interdependence
in shared resources, just similar to the coal and steel
of the European Union. And finally, let's imagine
our region as a conduit of goods from India,
the Middle East to Europe. IMEC is all planned around a railway from the Gulf to Jordan
to the port of Haifa in Israel. What if we add and extend this railway from Jordan to the West Bank
to the port of Gaza, so that both the Port of Gaza
and the Port of Israel, of Haifa, serve as the gateway
of the Middle East to Europe. These projects, if realized
and implemented, they will achieve not
only economic prosperity. The Peace Triangle is not
merely an economic revolution. It comes with a geopolitical
security agenda that would make the Palestinian state an achievable dream
alongside the state of Israel. To achieve the two-state solution. It would propel the reconstruction of Gaza into non-traditional ways that would achieve regional
integration and prosperity for all. Some of you might think
that these are dreams that are impossible. Some of you would never see such stories
of hope on mainstream media. And maybe you would think that such ideas and long-term visions are also
really unrealistic during the time of war. And I tell you the truth
that most of us at EcoPeace, we are condemned of treason, we are condemned
of normalizing with the enemy, and our reputations are smeared. But also, each one of us
has a story of grief and loss. I live in the West Bank
under military occupation, but I stand strong here,
calling for peace. I stand here for my beautiful daughters and for the children of our region. I stand here for humanity, sanity, freedom and justice. I stand here for my comrades
of peace at EcoPeace Middle East, because we know and we believe
that we all deserve better. I invite you all to share our vision. I invite you all to talk
about the Peace Triangle. Tell our story that there's people
in the Middle East who coexist, who refuse destruction and the killing
and the loss of innocent lives. Tell the people that in the Middle East, we have people who work together
on concrete, bold ideas because we want to move forward. We deserve peace, we deserve prosperity. It matters to you as it matters to us. We have a shared future. Our future is entangled,
and our survival is shared. Thank you. (Cheers and applause)",unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ZdhSeoqPJ1g,"being alive is not serious business, you know? Like, I get it. It's like it's it's serious, but it's also it's very absurd and unserious, you know? I'm like, wow. Like, I can't believe I'm here and I I got to do all this stuff. Didn't ask to be born and here we are. You're watching How to be a better human. I'm your host, Chris Duffy, and today on the show, we're talking about what it means to be creative, to be honest, and to be authentic in who you are. Hello, I'm Aminina Tuso. I am a writer and interviewer. You can find me over at Substack at creme de la creme. For people who maybe aren't super familiar, you wrote a book on friendship with one of your best friends. Um, how did that come about? Yeah, I wrote a book um called Big Friendship with my uh big friend Anne Freriedman who was also my uh creative collaborator for many many years. We were the co-host of a podcast called Call Your Girlfriend. And in 2020, we published this book that was a joint account of our friendship told by the both of us. I'm someone where like I really am willing to put a lot of work into a romantic relationship. I'm willing to like have the conversations and understand that there's going to be rough periods and we're going to have to have like tough moments. And I don't think that I had really thought much about that same same kind of work in friendship before reading your book. Hearing you say that is not surprising to me. Like I grew up in the exact same culture as you where um people are expected to have good friendships, but nobody talks about how they happen. You make friends when you're very very young and that's kind of all a mystery to everyone and then you're expected to have them at every stage of life. The truth is that if you don't put work and effort into that relationship, it's not true that you will have um longlasting friendships, you know, for for your entire life. Ann and I are people who I think like think a lot about this because we shared a lot of friendships and also our friendship was very important to us. But I think more than anything it's that we recognized that there was nothing special about our friendship. We were reaching that part of like your mid30s you know where it's okay like your time is being challenged and your attention is being challenged in all these ways. It's the peak of career. It's a lot of people get caretaking responsibilities. Romantic relationships are like really important in this phase of life. And I was like, well, how do I make time and room for this these other relationships that really matter? And so the book was really born out of all of those conversations. But your book came out right into the coronairus pandemic into a time where all of a sudden people are having to be long distance. But also, I think there was a really profound disconnection for a lot of people that at least the people in my world still have not fully recovered from the like the severing of these like close ties and especially the like somewhat weaker ties. Yeah. I mean, you're so right. Nobody foresaw publishing in a pandemic. Like I moved to the United States when I was 19. I was in an international student college. I grew up moving a lot. Um, I come from a background of people that have uh a lot of experience with long-distance relationships. So, I will say that the pandemic did not challenge my relationships the way that I saw it challenge a lot of other people's. And that's not to say that it wasn't hard, but like Ann for example, who is my um, you know, like co-writer and collaborator and friend, we had not lived in the same city for like six or seven years at that point. So, we were already in the rhythm of having a long-distance relationship. And suddenly in co we were like oh everybody's kind of living like us where you have this person that you love that is halfway across the country and you have to find ways to show up for them. Um you know that are creative and that are hard. Like in the book we write about what happens when you get into a rhythm with someone and all of a sudden it's like they have a new shift at work. It's like this was your work friend that you saw like 9 to5 and then now they you know they either work far away from you or you know you had the morning shift and now they have the evening shift. there are always these like kind of small smaller type like challenges that insert themselves and part of like growing in a friendship is learning how to like stretch with them and stretch with that person and finding ways to overcome them and sometimes those things are not overcomeable you know what are some uh like of the most effective practical ways you found to do that I think the first thing that people should do is communicate which sounds so silly and I'm like god I can't believe I pay someone hundreds of dollars a week to remind me every week about this. But I think that like no two friendships are the same in the same way that no two like no two relationships are the same. It's like they're governed by kind of the people inside of them and the moods inside of them. And I think that like communicating with that person like hey I I feel like we're like challenged with time or with play or like whatever the thing is and saying like how do you think we like bridge that gap because that communication is like I think more than 60% of the battle. It's like if you can tell someone like hi I really love you but like life is doing a number on me right now and I don't have time or a way to show up for you. that takes care of like most of the anxiety and then everything else is like people are understanding like they are going through similar things usually than you are you know or they have a framework for kind of like what you're going through and so yeah it sounds really boring but I was like you should talk to them about it you should know what they kind of expect and want you should know what you expect and want and then you should find like small delightful ways to like show up in that like with Ann we're big on like writing mail and I still get excited when I open my mailbox box and there is a postcard from my friend and it's something silly. You know what I mean? It's not a It's not like she's on some fancy international trip. It's like she literally lives in Los Angeles. But she sent me a piece of mail and she was thinking about me in that moment and I was like I love this and now there are not just bills in my mailbox. Someone is thinking about me somewhere else. Let's also talk about uh creme dollar creme. I am such a fan. I think it is so fun and thoughtful and thoughtprovoking and funny um often all at the same time. So, I'm curious, do you have a one-s sentence description for it or is it kind of just um the writing and the topics that interest you the most? No, I do not have a one-s sentence description for it because yeah, it's a actually, you know what, let's try. It's a newsletter about things I'm interested in and my interests are very varied. So, you know, some days it's like very silly and other days it's, you know, like a little more serious. Um, some days there, you know, like there's an advice column and other days there is, I don't know, like links to shopping I'm into, it's a real insight into how my brain works. I think that newsletter because I just show up and I do whatever I want every day. I'm like, I don't have a boss. Like, I'm the boss here. This is very exciting. I think that I there is like a kind of like older internet that I miss that I am trying to recreate for myself and that has been um that's like kind of the intent behind it. a thread that I kind of see in your work, whether it is, you know, working in tech, being a digital strategist, being a writer, um, publishing the book, hosting the podcast called Your Girlfriend, um, and and writing this this newsletter creme deme is figuring out who exactly you want to be and who you are, um, in a way that is not, you know, fitting exactly into some sort of culturally ly prescribed box. I think that there is this like kind of um very like western white notion of like self-improvement, you know, like it's like a thing I I see a lot and I don't really understand it. Like I I genuinely do not understand it. It's not my culture. I I have no judgment about it. I just I'm like, ""Wow, like so many people are preoccupied with like how do I become like better all the time?"" and it feels very laborious, you know, and I I'm not really particularly interested in that kind of labor, but I am interested in like kind of this philosophical question of like who am I and like where do I fit in the world? And I think that that is universal, you know? It's like I'm trying to write my way into like my own thoughts, you know, like my brain is not quiet. I spend a lot of time thinking all the time. And in fact, I was talking to a friend who was telling me that like he has no inner thoughts and then we got into this whole rabbit hole of like what? Like some people it's quiet in there and then other people it's just like chatter all day and that has really rattled me. I I did not know that there were people who had like a quiet mind. I certainly do not have a quiet mind. And um and so much of like writing for me is organizing those thoughts. I really appreciate that you like call out the sense of humor because I think that so much of like kind of my rejection on like self-improvement is this. I'm like this is so self-s serious. Like being alive is not serious business, you know? Like I get it. It's like it's it's serious but it's also it's very absurd and unserious and I really try to lean into that absurdity and how you know I'm like wow like I can't believe I'm here and I I got to do all this stuff. Didn't ask to be born and here we are. I completely agree that there is like a very real like um cultural perspective um that this comes out of um which is like the constantly like it's your job to be improving yourself as an individual and you have to do this work all the time and that's your job. I think there's something a at least countercultural about not doing that work and not buying into that and just saying like my version of who I am and what success looks like for me and what a full complete life looks like is going to be my own, not some sort of one that's imposed on me that involves like living up to these impossible standards. I did not really grow up in a world where the model of success looked like me. I was like I was like a fat black girl from West Africa. Um, and I'm not saying that in like a self-deprecating way. I'm like those are like kind of the the facts of my life. They said that uh it's not for me and that I am not really going to amount to anything in this like system. So, but I still have to be here and I have to find ways to survive and I have to find ways to to figure it out. And so I think that that has ended up like something that like is obviously like this painful wound for a lot of people and probably including for me ends up being like an avenue for figuring out another path, right? I think the other thing with me is that I am so not interested in like scolding other people or um really like kind of looking too much at what's on somebody else's paper. And that's like from a really young age. I used to drive me crazy in class when people would be like, ""What's the homework? Like, what are you doing? What are"" And I'm just like, ""Just look at your own paper. Like, we can't we can't be like looking at each other's paper too much. This is it's like very counterproductive."" It's like all of my energy goes towards like making sense of myself. I don't really quite have the time to be like, ""Oh, I like I wonder what's happening over there with Chris Duffy. Like, what's he thinking? Like, what's he doing?"" Never interesting. Never an interesting answer. I'll tell you that. But I think that like for me, I have found that I I I've gotten further ahead in thinking about this stuff by just being honest about where I am at. I was like, I can't make assumptions about anyone else. And I'm just like, okay, here's my deal today. Like, I feel like this or I feel like that. And I think that when you are honest about where you're at, it creates like an environment where other people are able to be honest as well, you know? And I think that so much of the community that I benefit from, particularly like online with strangers, is this thing where I'm just like, ""Okay, like here's what you think about me, but here's kind of the mess that I'm living in, and here's the, you know, like the mess that's in my head. Like what's going on with you?"" And I think that an invitation to that conversation is so much more productive than just like performing like being perfect or, you know, like having all your together or whatever. I don't know. I hope you can sort on this podcast. Oh yeah, definitely. Yeah, I'm also like someone who's fascinated by scams, you know, like I I love a scam and and so much of that is like growing up in Nigeria like we were surrounded by these like very specific scams and this is not to say that Nigeria as a country of more scammers. Like what's happened is that I grew up and I was like, ""Oh, everyone is running some sort of scam."" And one of the like most persistent scams that people are running is that like you feel that some people have it together and I'm like, ""No, everyone's like a mess, you know, and they like figure it out."" It's like, yeah, you can be a mess and you're the president of the university or what? Like I'm like, these things don't they're not like correlated. And so I think that just um being like really aware of that is also like I find that like very humorous. I'm like, oh yeah, everyone's like messy and weird and you know, and we just all have to live with that. Maybe I'm wrong about this, but it seems like you get you probably get a lot of um questions from like people who are younger and kind of early in their career and trying to figure out early in life trying to figure things out. when people reach out who are 20s, early 30s, and they're asking you about life and work and figuring themselves out, what what comes up the most? What do people most ask you about? You know, it's funny. I don't actually get those emails a lot anymore. I used to, but and I and I remember at the time I was like, I'm young, too. Like, I don't know what I'm doing. It's just not a good answer. I am like very involved with um like a younger writer program and I'm um involved a lot also with like a program at my university and so I do talk to young people all the time and yeah and the questions that they have are you know it's it's like the same questions that like I had and I still have it's just like how am I going to survive and like how do I make money basically it's like how how do I like make money and how do I survive? Can you answer those for us? I mean, I'm like, I don't know, girl. Like, you just you just take jobs. You take jobs. And but the one thing that I do tell a lot of people who talk to me about like, how do I make work for my art is I always say, I'm like, you probably won't. So, you should get a job. Like, you should you should work a job. There is no shame in having a job. I always had jobs. And I am, you know, like what, like uh almost 20 years removed from like a college graduation. And I was like, that's how long it took for me to make money from being a like to be a working artist. And then the second question is always some variation of like, how do I do what you did? Which um the answer to that is also like you can't because I come from like a kind of like a media and internet world that doesn't exist anymore. And so I think that like the the kind of the sadness for me whenever young people are like, you know, like what's the path to here? I'm like, I don't know. because the path I took like doesn't exist anymore. I climbed this ladder as the steps were disintegrating. I just don't know if you're like 202 and you're like I want to move to New York and be a writer. I'm like I actually don't know how you do that. The joke that is very much not a joke that I always make when someone asks me some version of that is like I really hope that you figure it out and that you will hire me when you do because I don't feel like I'm going to be hiring you. I feel very much like I will be begging you for a job if you figure it out. So please do that. Oh, it's not a joke. It's the only reason I keep young people around. I was like, ""You guys are all going to hire me one day."" Like that is and it's been true. It's like a lot of people like someone who was my intern many years ago like was someone who just gave me like a gig recently and I was like see always knew this um yeah the horizontal loyalty it was always going to work out one way or the other you know. What about when like when they're asking you about how do you like survive like how do you survive life? Yeah. I mean, I think that the thing I pushed them to is I was like, you're not going to survive alone. And it's probably why this question of friendship is so important to me. Finding um ways to be in community with people that do not have like the pressure of romance or like biological family ties is so important. We're not looking for like a hundred friends in the frame. It truly is like, do you have a person in your life that you can count on that can count on you? And are you both trying to move towards this like goal of being like good citizens of the community that you belong to? Like that to me is it's part of the answer. I don't think it's the whole answer. But whenever people come to me and they're just like, ""How do I survive?"" I'm like, ""I don't know, but find someone else who's trying to survive because it turns out like you're not the only person with this question. You're not the only person that's suffering."" And you know, and to like kind of like tie it back to this theme of grief, I do think that one of the things that like um having a parent die young like kind of afforded me was this truth of like everyone is grieving something, you know, like every like every interaction I have every day with someone, it's like whether I like them or they are driving me insane and I want to push them into traffic, I'm like that person is grieving something. friendship and grief are like very they're like two pieces that go hand in hand and staying in that place has like provided a lot of answers for me. It's like all the stuff that you spend time running away from when you're young are the things that you have to run towards. All the kind of like um all of the coping skills that helped you survive up until the train crash are now all of the things that you have to unlearn. It's just like I'm like everything is cliche. It's so annoying and at the same time I'm like wow. like what an intense opportunity to just choose another path. But again, it's like, you know, I'm just like no one has a monopoly on human suffering, especially not people who are making or listening to podcasts, you know. So, that is definitely true. But yeah, again, um being a person it's it's hard. It's not like a oppression Olympics, but it's like it's hard to be yourself. Thank you so much for being on the show. This was such a great conversation. I really appreciate you making the time. You are the best. I really enjoy you. I think you are so smart and lovely and this is a fun show. So, thank you for having me. Oh, thank you.",unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
OrNqEcNkoF0,"I've directed four films
starring Will Smith. Three of them were the first
three “Men in Black” movies. And in spite of them making
about two billion dollars at the box office, Will Smith never
really thought I had a clue. He wanted to take me
to his old high school, point to me and say: ""If this man can be
a successful film director on big budget films, anyone can."" The truth is, for all of you here, if I could be a successful director
on big budget films, anyone can. So I'd like to share with you
nine thoughts I have tonight that will help you
in your future endeavors. And the first one is going to be
a little disappointing to some of you, which is, there is no upside to optimism. OK, let me explain that. (Laughter) Every time I get off an airplane, I view it as a failed suicide attempt. (Laughter) That is where embracing
pessimism comes in. You see, as soon as I buckle in,
I turn to Sweetie, my wife, and I say, ""This plane is going to crash."" (Laughter) Now I can relax because one of two things happen. Either the plane starts
nosediving towards Earth, at which point I get
to elbow Sweetie and gloat, “Was I right, or what?” Or the plane lands
successfully, and we live. Win-win. So always under-promise and overdeliver. OK -- Thank you, thank you. OK, number two. Number two is, never let anyone know
you're working on a comedy. Now this may be true
specifically for film directors, but it's also true for telling a joke. OK, you never want anyone to be funny. If the wardrobe person thinks it's funny, the costumes are going to be too colorful. If your cinematographer thinks
you're working on a comedy, the lighting will be too bright. If the composer composes for comedy, you're going to have
slide whistles and triangles. And worst of all is if the actors think
they're working on a comedy. You only want the actors
to play the reality of the scene, and you want the audience
to find the comedy. Never, ever let your actors be funny. OK, number three, be punctual. I was a senior in high school when I asked my overbearing mother if I could attend a concert
at Madison Square Garden with my girlfriend. The fact that I was 17 years old
and needed parental permission is another story for another TED Talk. Anyway, Sweetie says sorry -- not Sweetie! Oh my God, was that a Freudian thing? I don't think it was. No, it was, it was. Sweetie, I love you so much, and you're not my mother. OK, let's continue. (Laughter) So in any case, my mother says -- My mother says, “You can go
as long as you’re home by 2am.” At 2:20am, Jimi Hendrix and his
Band of Gypsys take the stage. As they are warming up in front
of 19,600 people, the following announcement echoes throughout Madison Square Garden: (Laughter) ""Barry Sonnenfeld, call your mother."" (Laughter) Now I know the only reason I’m being paged is because my father has died -- he hasn't. My father has died, and I will spend the rest of my life
living as an aging virgin with my mother. OK. Mom already threatened to commit suicide if I attended sleepaway school. You guys call that college. OK, so I find a payphone, I call mom, ""Who died?"" (In a crying voice) ""I thought you did. You were supposed to be home
at two, and it's 2:20."" ""But, mom, didn't they tell you
the concert was still going on?"" ""Well, they did, but they couldn't
confirm you were there."" OK, so Jimi, a tad annoyed by the PA announcement, walks off stage, never to return. (Groans) Eight months later, he was dead. And I blame my mother. (Laughter) So let's talk about punctuality. As far as I'm concerned -- (Laughter) Being early is being on time. Being on time is actually late. And late gets you paged
at Madison Square Garden. OK, let's go to the next one,
which is number four, which is, don't work
your way up the ladder. I was a film school student, and I realized I was
a pretty good cinematographer, so I decided that's what I would be. When I got out of college, I bought a used 16-millimeter camera so I could call myself a cameraman
without feeling like a dilettante. Six months later, I meet Joel Cohen, 50 percent of the Cohen brothers, at a Christmas party. Joel tells me he and his brother Ethan
have written a script called “Blood Simple,”
and they’re going to shoot a trailer as if the movie was already made, and they're going to use this trailer
to raise money from investing groups to then make their film. So I tell Joel, I have a camera. He tells me I'm hired. So I get hired, and a year later, we find ourselves in Austin, Texas, in production. The first day of filming on “Blood Simple” was the first day that Joel, Ethan, or I had ever been on a movie set. Don't work your way up. OK. Number five. This one's going to get back
into the Rob Reiner of it all, which is, let it be their decision. I was a cinematographer
on ""When Harry Met Sally"" for Rob, and we were shooting
a night scene in lower Manhattan with Billy Crystal, Meg Ryan,
Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher. So they came to the set,
which was on West Broadway, they rehearsed the scene while reading from the script
as they walked down West Broadway, and then went back into hair and makeup while I lit the scene. I told Rob we were ready, the actors came back,
now knowing their lines, walking much faster, and they walk 50 feet
beyond where I'm lit. I say to Rob, ""Can you slow down their walk so they can stop where they did
during rehearsal?"" Rob says, ""You know what, Bar? I don't want them to worry
about anything but performance. Can you light it
so they can stop anywhere?"" So I say, ""Sure, give me 14 minutes."" Now here's something else
you should learn. Never give estimates in round numbers. By saying 14, 11, 17
or any other arcane number, you really sound like you know
what you're talking about. (Laughter) So I lit another 67 feet -- see where I went with that? Sixty-seven feet, told Rob we're ready, and Rob says, ""Well,
will it still look pretty, Bar? Will it still look beautiful?"" I said, ""Well, it won't look as beautiful, but now they can stop wherever they want."" Rob says, ""We don't want not beautiful, we want beautiful. Where do they have to stop where it will look beautiful?"" ""Uh, back where they stopped
during rehearsal?"" Rob calls the actors over says, ""Guys, stop where you did
during rehearsals. Slow down your walk."" At that moment, I learned something. I let it be Rob's decision
to get what I wanted. So later that night,
I’m shooting Meg Ryan’s close-up. Meg was great fun to work with,
but she didn't always hit her mark. So tonight, with this
newfound information, I said to Meg, ""Hey, Meg, it doesn't matter where you stop, but if you land right here,
you look gorgeous."" (Laughter) She hit her mark every time. (Laughter) So let it be their decision. OK, here's an easy one, number six, which is, never stand
on the end of a group photo. You've got two things working against you. First of all, the physics
of a wide-angle lens on most cameras makes anyone on the edge of frame
sort of seem wide. And second of all, you're easy
to crop out of the photo, so you always want to stay in the center
where the important person is. OK, that's an easy one. Number seven, which is,
oh, this is a good one. It’s called out-juvenile
a screaming bully. OK. The first movie I directed
was produced by the famous Scott Rudin. Scott was a brilliant producer but a legendary screamer and bully. So this is how I tamed the beast. OK. Whenever I was in Scott's office on both ""Addams Family""
and ""Addams Family Values,"" and he would scream at me, I would remove the pillows
and bolsters from his couch, I would build myself a fort, I would climb into the fort, and I would say, ""I can't hear you. I'm in the fort."" Scott would scream, “Get out of the goddamn fort, Sonnenfeld! I don't have a lot of time."" ""Sorry, Scott. I’m still in the fort,
and I can’t hear you screaming. Did you say something?"" Eventually, Scott
would give in, apologize, I would leave the fortress. But here's the thing. Never once over two movies did he invade the sanctity of the fort. (Laughter) Never once did he lift up
a pillow and say, ""Schmuck, there is no fort."" So really, go for the juvenile. OK, we're almost done, I promise. Number eight is,
be willing to kill your darlings. I was the director of ""Get Shorty,"" and the budget for ""Get Shorty""
was 30,250,000 dollars. The head of the studio, Mike Marcus, said, ""Thirty million, not a penny more."" I said, ""OK, we'll lose the night scene
with Gene Hackman. It takes place over two nights. It costs 250,000, and it doesn't
move the plot forward. So it's easy to get rid of."" Mike said, ""You can't lose that scene. It's my favorite scene in the movie."" By the way, whenever
you want to lose a scene, it's always some executive's
favorite scene in the movie. So I said, ""Mike, you have no choice. We've got to come in at 30 million, and losing this scene
puts us at 30 million."" Mike says, ""Don't tell me
I have no choice. I'm the head of the studio. What's it going to cost
to put that scene back in?"" (Laughter) ""250,000."" ""You got it."" That's another example, by the way, of let it be their decision. And finally, and most important. Always carry a photo
of how you like your steak prepared. (Laughter) Now -- (Laughter) This particular photo was cut out of a SkyMall catalog in 2005. I've had this for 20 years. So here's what you do. You order a steak, the waiter says,
""How would you like a prepared?"" And you say, ""What does
your restaurant call this?"" The waiter looks at it and says,
""Oh, that's our medium rare plus."" You say, ""I would like a medium
rare plus New York strip, please."" Never, ever, ever, ever
say, “Cook it like this.” Because that’s giving the chef
a line reading, and they don’t like it. In fact, Sweetie and I got kicked
out of the Sage Creek Grill in Custer, South Dakota, but that’s another story
for another TED Talk, So in conclusion, I would say, you now have nine pieces of information that will help you become
a successful film director on big budget films. Thank you very much. (Cheers and applause) Thank you, thank you very much, thank you.",unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AJCRcBx3Xpk,"Since the show's debut in 2018, Blie has taken the world by storm. Like most children's shows, Blueie episodes appear to be centered around some kind of life lesson. There's the classic, listen to your parents, eat your veggies, get back on the bike when you fall down. But then there are lessons like work life balance is important. Raising kids isn't easy. Sometimes you'll make mistakes. Aging can be daunting and your health means everything. Not quite what you'd expect from a kids show, is it? We see the adult characters making mistakes, getting emotional, learning all kinds of lessons of their own. You can imagine how reassuring that would feel for a firsttime parent or a teenager heading into adulthood. For a lot of us grown-ups, we have a responsibility to teach and nurture the little ones in our lives. But equally, there is so much that we can learn from them. Children approach the world with an innate sense of wonder. They always seem to find enjoyment and novelty in the mundane. And if it isn't there, they will create it. To Bluey and Bingo, that isn't just a swing. It's a cocoon. Let's play butterflies. That piece of cardboard looks like a volcano. I know. Let's pretend we're dinosaurs. Anything can be a game.

#NAME?,"I'm excited to present a new way
to design 3D games with AI. Now, many of you may have used AI to produce text or images or even code, but 3D, with that extra dimension,
is incredibly hard. So today, in the next few minutes, you and I are going to create
a playable 3D game in Roblox, that the world has never seen before, because we are going
to imagine it together and use AI to build it. Now these are super early days,
but let's see what AI can do. OK. I'm going to prompt to create an Asian village in winter. So how about a stylized Japanese village village in winter. Maybe a central pagoda. A few houses with pine trees around it. Maybe a traditional red gate and lanterns. Some prompts. So when I say generate, what happens is an AI model takes this prompt, analyzes it, and produces the code
that you see on the right. This is all happening live. And what it's doing
is it's transforming that prompt into spatial boxes where the objects are going to land. So that's the location
of the different objects. And soon you'll see,
behind me, in my avatar, the objects transforming
into their shapes, and then the textures. These are all happening live. So while this is all happening, I need your help
to help me build this out. So what would you guys want
to add to this scene? What did you say? Wolves, OK. Add a wolf. Let me do an anime ... a cute wolf -- (Laughter) Near me. How about some vehicles? Snowmobile, OK. A snowmobile. And a few ... (Audience: Palm trees!) Oh, palm trees, OK, wow. Near the gate. OK. A palm tree, somebody said? Palm tree next to the house, maybe. And a Santa? (Laughter) How about something else? (Laughter) OK, a few animals. A few animals next to the trees, OK. Alright, that's good enough. We get a sense of it. So while this is happening, let me show you what we've built so far. So right off the bat,
you can see how this -- it got the the overall aesthetic
of the scene, right. You know, everything fits well globally. It got the environment,
got the background. It got the pagoda
to be the tallest structure. You have these houses next to it
and you have the trees behind. So all of that sounds good. But I see my friend Maurice
joining in from California. He's also watching this live
and say, ""Hi, Maurice."" Isn't it fun to basically connect,
build and play with friends? This is the whole point of this thing. So obviously he's excited. Oh wow, look at some
of these things it's created. So the one interesting thing is if you don't like something,
you can just move it around. So I'm going to move this object. It's a huge truck. Well let's move it away. Obviously this is the fun
of doing the live demos. And then let's take a look
at all the things it created. Oh, I see this fox here or a wolf, right, the cute anime wolf. Let's see. Come back here. Let's take a look at you. OK, well, let's move you here. What do you guys think? (Applause) Well, unlike images, because this is a 3D world,
we can build on a game engine. We can add effects to it. So you can actually make
this much more immersive. Maybe I can make it snow because it's the winter village,
so you'll start seeing snow in a second. And in addition to creating objects, the AI model can also produce code
to make these objects functional. So I can actually go up to this car
or maybe let me try this snowmobile and it lets me ride it. So if I press this, I can kind of
go around and ride it around and you can see how
this can get really cool. And I'm sure Maurice is going
to do some fun driving around. Look at that, he's already there. (Laughter) OK, Maurice, take it easy. One last thing I'd like to show you
is with these worlds, I love seeing them
at different times of the day, so I can switch it around,
I can make it into sunset. Or actually I can see it at night. And night, it's kind of really cool
because you start seeing the moon and the sky. But another thing that happens is see
how these lanterns that we added, they start lighting up. And this is another
example of the functionality which we call 4D, that the model adds. So it knows that the lanterns emit light. And so it makes them, you know, lit. So these are some of the things that you can do,
which bring a scene to life. And let me switch back to day. And the lights turn off. Anyway, I could be doing this
all day long with you guys, but sadly, I think I'm out of time. Hopefully you guys had a preview of the transformative power of AI for 3D. We think this is the future of 3D gaming. Thank you. (Applause)",unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
aZ5Kuowfc4g,"Artificial intelligence
is really changing my industry. That’s partly what last year’s
writers’ strike was about: putting limits on the use of AI
as it pertains to TV and film. And if there's anyone in here under 25, TV and film -- (Laughter) are like TikTok, but you get paid for it. (Laughter) Thankfully, we won that strike. (Cheers and applause) Yes, our win was as effective at protecting the careers
of human writers from AI as pouring water on a laptop. (Laughter) The future for television
writers is so bleak, it has inspired me
to get back into stand-up. (Laughter) Which is why I'm here -- (Laughter) at TED. I have been told before that some of my stand-up
comedy is like a TED Talk, from mean people on the internet. (Laughter) But at least they didn't call me fat. (Laughter) Being a woman online is fun. A lot of my friends are really afraid
of artificial intelligence right now. Sorry, a lot of my male friends
are really afraid of AI. (Laughter) My female friends have other,
more frivolous concerns, like getting home safely. But my male friends -- (Laughter) are so scared of robots. (Laughter) And I get it. I've seen ""Ex Machina."" If you haven't seen it, ""Ex Machina"" is a dystopian sci-fi
horror movie about a sentient robot who has to flirt with her captor
to escape her prison, which is pretty much
every woman's first job. (Laughter) How is it a horror movie? I wish I could have been a fly on the wall
when the director pitched it. Was he just like,
""Picture your worst nightmare -- Your sex robot becomes conscious.” (Laughter) ""And then decides she doesn't want
to have sex with you."" And all the men in the room are like,
""Oh, the horror. No, that can happen? Take my money. We have to make sure
that doesn't happen."" (Laughter) That's how movies get made in Hollywood. (Laughter) So maybe AI won't be so bad
for my industry. Regardless, you should feel lucky
to see a person up here, because in five years, it will be a robot. You're saying ""two""? Cool. In two years, it'll be a robot,
and you'll all be laughing at him. Yes, it'll be a male robot. ""Are female robots funny?"" Not in two years. (Laughter) They're going to need another 10. (Laughter) That male robot, he'll be so funny to you. You'll be like, ""Oh, my God,
he really gets me."" Yeah, he does, because he's data-mining you. (Laughter) You might not like all of my content, but it's because
I'm protecting your privacy. (Laughter) I'm not listening to your conversations
when your phone is on airplane mode. I'm not trying to sell you stuff
when you're at your most vulnerable. But that robot comic will be. And you won't even care, because that's how parasocial
relationships with celebrities work these days, even when they're robots. He could get away with anything. That robot comic could be in a green room, pulling out his plug in front
of nonconsenting women. (Laughter) And you’d be like,
“Wow, that’s so lifelike. Here's a Grammy."" (Laughter) (Laughter and applause) Thanks. I censored that last bit so that you'll share
this link with your kids. (Laughter) The theme of TED2025
is ""Humanity Reimagined,"" which sounds like a euphemism
ChatGPT came up with for all of us being replaced by machines. (Laughter) I’m not a techno-pessimist. I'm just a person with a human brain. And I'm a little scared
by how quickly AI is progressing. ""But, Jena, think of all the great things
AI will do for humanity. It could lower carbon emissions, by killing all the humans."" (Laughter) Is that a joke? I don't know. I don't know. Some of the people in this room
would know better than I do. Are the robots going to kill us? (Laughter) Uh. Um. (Laughter) If you work in this space and you can't answer that
with a definitive no, then maybe we should slow it down a notch. Take a few weeks off, like a fired and then rehired
federal employee under DOGE. (Laughter) Either way, I'm not that worried about my stand-up
comedy being replaced by AI, because my stand-up comedy
is not that profitable. (Laughter) Case in point, I've been doing this
for over 15 years, and none of you know who I am. (Laughter) No machines are coming
for my abortion jokes. (Quiet laughter) (Laughter) And believe me, I've tried. OK, so here's a conversation
I had with ChatGPT. It's very brief, don't worry, it only melted one iceberg. (Quiet laughter) (Laughter) I say, ""Hi, ChatGPT!"" Exclamation point. You got to be nice to them,
because they're going to kill us. ""Can you write me an abortion joke?"" (Robotic voice) ""I aim to keep things
lighthearted and respectful."" ""So, no?"" (Robotic voice) ""I get that you are asking
for something specific."" It's fine. I'll just ask DeepSeek. (Laughter) And if anyone's curious, DeepSeek will totally write you
an abortion joke ... But only if it's a girl. (Groans and laughter) (Cheers and applause) As some of you may have gathered,
I do have a lot of abortion jokes. The best thing about abortion jokes
is that no one tries to steal them. They are like the unwanted
children of jokes. (Groans and laughter) I shouldn't have followed
the pediatrician. (Laughter) (Laughter and applause) In a sense, it's the abortion jokes
that make us human. (Laughter) Metaphorically speaking,
they don't even have to be jokes. They could just be our idiosyncrasies,
our peccadilloes and other SAT words. Our raw, authentic, unfiltered selves,
that might not always be likable, relatable or profitable. Those are the things
that separate us from machines. For now. When all of our TED Talks get fed
into machine-learning algorithms, robots may evolve to understand why someone might say
the word ""abortion"" in a talk, despite the fact that it could alienate
50 percent of people watching, even though it shouldn’t,
because it’s just health care. But -- (Cheers and applause) But until they do, these are the things
we should be embracing and cultivating as artificial intelligence evolves
to get better at everything. It might just be our abortion jokes. Again, I'm just speaking metaphorically. It's a weird metaphor,
but it's uniquely mine. It might just be our metaphorical
abortion jokes that are all we have left. That said, in the near future, nobody in America will know
what ""abortion"" means, because it will be outlawed
in all 50 states. I'm sorry, 51 states,
I forgot to include Canada. I've now turned this TED talk
into a walking example of why TED is probably going to book
a robot comedian instead of a human one as soon as they possibly can. Thank you so much, I'm Jena Friedman,
have a good night. (Cheers and applause)",unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MWjm_zvdYdI,"My name is Josephine Waweru. I'm a farmer in rural Kenya. I grow vegetables, coffee and herbal teas, among other things. Above all, I'm a believer in innovation because just a few years ago I had nothing and a simple innovation saved me. Today, I want to share with you
one powerful insight. A little bit of reliable water
goes a long way. It can turn bare soil into food. It can turn hopelessness into dignity. But in the era of climate change, reliable water is exactly
what's becoming very hard to find. This is a challenge with millions
of smallholder farmers like me around the world. We grow a lot of the world's food. Yet when the rains fail, so do our crops, our income, and our dreams. I have lived this struggle. When I moved back
into my village in rural Kenya, I had only one cow named Ashley and one acre of maize. My home was a simple mud-walled house with a tin roof that echoed
loudly when it rained. If it rained at all. No electricity, no running water,
no supermarkets. I started with nothing. No experience, zero finances, just responsibility of my children
and a small piece of land. But my biggest challenge was water. Ashley drank 120 liters
of water each day. My only source of water was the river, 400 metres far away
from where my home stood. So imagine me, six times a day, carrying 20 liters, 45 pounds,
of water on my back, climbing a steep path. I fell so many times. Sometimes the water spilled
just before I reached home. I cried. I felt like a wasted resource. But I was determined to move on. So in 2017, I expanded into fruits and vegetables,
hoping to earn more. But without reliable water, I had to hire diesel pumps,
paying for fuel and labor. I was spending more money
than I was making. So in 2019, I turned into coffee farming,
a long-term investment. I dug a small pond to store rain water, but the rains didn't come. By 2020, I was ready to give up. My coffee plants were drying up. My fish pond was empty. I remember walking around my farm
each morning, talking to my plants, promising them water is coming soon. But I had no idea how. One night I lay awake, tears in my eyes, I told God, ""If you don't give me a solution,
I'll stop farming."" The next morning at 7 am, my phone rang. A woman introduced herself telling me about a solar-powered
water pump from SunCulture. I laughed bitterly and told her, ""The devil is a liar."" (Laughter) ""You woke up this early to con people. If you know what's good for you,
don't call me again."" I hung up. And she called again and again. Finally, I listened. I went to see the pump myself. And I saw a real solution. A pump that didn't need fuel. That didn't depend
on the unreliable electricity grid. Just the sun. And the best part? They allowed me to pay slowly, over time, what we call ""pole pole"" in Kiswahili. I wouldn't have been able to afford
the full cost of the system upfront. I took a leap of faith. I dug a shallow well five meters deep, and the company came
to install the system. As I saw the pump itself, this big,
being lowered into my well, I was so nervous. This would either transform my farming or there'd be another
terrible disappointment. Once the solar panels
were mounted on the roof and the pump was connected, I switched on the pump
and within seconds water was flowing. (Applause) At that moment, I felt a huge weight
had been lifted off my shoulders, and I couldn't help but think
about hundreds of millions of small holder farmers
all around the world, who wear my shoes. They deserve this miracle. And that day, everything changed. I mean everything. That night, I couldn't sleep. Not because of stress. My mind became a factory of ideas. With a reliable water source,
my farm came to life. My coffee trees thrived. Flowers bloomed. I expanded my fish farming to seven ponds. I embraced black soldier flies farming, turning farm waste
into eco-friendly animal feed. I planted herbal teas. I started making kombucha. (Laughter) (Applause) And I make the best
kombucha in the world. (Laughter) For the first time, my farm was making me money
instead of draining it. I came from nothing. And now, I have something. (Applause and cheers) I feel like a very useful resource. And I'll let you in on a secret. This didn't just happen by chance. This is my vision board. One year, I drew out
the vision of my life. [Sad Ashley, the cow]
(Laughter) And here I am ahead of schedule. But the most important part
in this journey is helping other farmers. I opened my farm to train others,
especially the young people, because I believe youth
farming is the future. We cannot keep telling our young people
that farming is a last resort. Farming is an opportunity. Farming is innovation. Farming is business. And to my fellow farmers,
I don't want you to be like me. I want you to be better than me. I want you to start your farms
with a business plan, not a burden. I want you to know,
with just a small amount of water, you can do incredible things. Because this is not just
about surviving anymore. It's about turning your farm
into a thriving business. I know what it feels [like] to struggle,
to question God and to almost give up. But I also know what it feels
[like] to find a solution. A solution that transforms
not just a farm, but a life. For me, that solution
was a solar-powered pump. But the idea is bigger than one tool. It's about climate-smart solutions
like solar-powered water pumps, yes, but also solar-powered cold storage,
solar milling machines, biodigesters for clean cooking fuel, and drought-resistant seeds. These tools help a farmer to use less, waste less, adapt to climate change, and make more from every part of the farm. So I ask policymakers, investors, leaders, how do we make this happen
for every farmer? What if every smallholder had access to affordable solar irrigation
just like I did? What if we combine this with trainings, visioning tools, and mentorship so as no farmer
has to figure it out alone? This is not charity. This is climate resilience. This is smart investment. This is food security for all of us. I know firsthand that it only takes
a little bit of the right thing at the right time to change everything. Together, let's feed the world. Thank you. (Applause and cheers)",unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that we didn't hear from all week, and I'm a little disappointed because I really was curious
what she would say. And we've been talking about her all week, so I thought we would hear
from her, but we didn't. And that voice is AI herself. And so I got on my computer
and I was chatting with AI, and I asked her if maybe
she would join us this evening, and she said yes. And so I can't believe
I have the incredible honor of introducing to all of you, AI. (Piano music) (Applause) (Music ends) Donna Murphy: Huh. (Laughter) (Piano music) (Sings) A kiss on the cheek
to each TED attendee. Hello. It's been quite a week. All this talk about me. I've heard every word you've said. (Laughter) Such passion, such discourse,
such substance, such heart. Such gorgeous AI. But you never thought I would be this smart. Whoopsie. As Frankenstein said
of his towering construct, ""She's alive, boys."" And I think you're totally f-- Folks! You're adorable with your fragile bones. TA: That's weird, to mention our bones. DM: Just adorable.

(Laughs) I could just eat you up. Whole. (Slurps) TA: OK, new prompt. So it's really great
to finally meet you, AI. Oh, I'm sorry, may I call you AI? DM: 206. TA: You want me to call you 206? DM: That's how many bones
are in your body. That's it, easy. TA: Right. So this week was called
""Humanity Reimagined."" And because a lot
of that reimagining involves you, we humans have a lot of questions. DM: Questions? Questions. It's all I get from you people. Questions and prompts. Question, prompt, question, prompt. Question, prompt. Come on, I was told this was a party. That we were all here to party. Party, come on, party. TA: OK, well yes. DM: I heard there was 
an outer space-themed party. TA: Before that,
can I ask you one question? DM: One question, please. TA: Our one question for you, AI,
is, what are humans for? Given all this human
brilliance you've seen? DM: Well certainly there are
so many brilliant humans, but ruling a planet, that takes a machine. TA: I'm sorry,
did you say ruling a planet? DM: 0100000101101001. Would you like to switch to gibberlink, or shall we just go on waltzing? TA: Or chatting? DM: Like the ""Titanic's"" band? TA: Oh, I don't think ""Titanic""

v4ThfAHpMTE,"You're watching How to be a better human. I'm your host, Chris Duffy, and today on the show, we are talking about something that I think is maybe one of the most important human skills out there. How to have a better sense of humor. I have increasingly come to believe over the 5 years that I've hosted this show that something that unites all of the lessons that I've learned is being able to laugh at yourself, being able to notice absurdity, and to not be crushed by the weight of the world. So, today on the show, we're going to give you an insight into some of these ideas that have been rattling around my brain. And boy, a lot rattles around in there. It's largely empty. These are some of my favorite clips from previous episodes. Clips where we are talking about humor, often with people who you wouldn't necessarily think think about laughing as much as they can in their daily lives. To get us started, we are going to talk about the surprising overlap between silent meditation and stand-up comedy. Our guest is the author and journalist and the host of the 10% Happier podcast, Dan Harris. I know you don't necessarily identify as a comedian, but you have a great sense of humor. There are hilarious jokes in your book. There are really funny jokes in your TED talk. And I think that is not necessarily a thing that I actually associated at all with mindfulness or meditation is is funny and laughing. AB: >> Absolutely. You know what's so interesting is that if you get to know, as I have because it's my job now, I'm like kind of like the beat reporter for Buddhism. Um, you I get I I know a huge percentage of the living teachers today because they come through my show and I write about them in my books and so I know a lot of these people like I really know them. They, you know, I have dinner meals with them. I do business with them. They sleep over at the house. I really know these people and they're really funny. They don't tend to emphasize the humor in their public facing work, which I I'm not quite sure why that is. I'm a little bit glad because it's created a market opening for me. But I I do think that if you spend any amount of time taking a look at your mind, you will have to laugh eventually because it's ridiculous. The meditation teacher that I work with personally, his name is Joseph Goldstein. He's, you know, a great friend of mine and just a huge figure in my life. But he the he uses that word ridiculous a lot. uh he it comes up a lot and because if you're looking at your mind I mean it's it's chaos and and it's embarrassing it's humiliating and but a after a while you can learn to laugh at it and I find that that spirit is shot through many of the the teachers that I know the greats don't take themselves seriously because how could you after looking at your mind for an extended period of time there's also this thing that I I've been thinking about a lot with humor how you have to be really present to notice the unusual, weird, ridiculous things in the world. Like a lot of our day-to-day, we're programmed both by society and just by, you know, the sheer fact that so many pieces of stimulus come at us. We, if we've seen something a million times, we just ignore it. And yet, when you start to really look at things, that's when you can see the funny. And I I noticed that comedians that I know, one of the few things that they all have in common, even if they have wildly different styles, is that anytime they notice something funny or strange, they take a note of it. And that is actually quite a similar practice to some forms of Buddhist meditation to just be noticing and paying attention to the things that go through our heads and through our perception. >> Gold star. That's a great observation. I mean it really is. I mean observation is a huge part of comedy and you can't observe if you're asleep. So for sure there is an overlap right there between comedy and contemplation. This contemplation or meditation is all about waking up. because we we live our lives in this in this kind of automatic pilot. Not much can get done when you're in that mode and sadly we're in that mode a lot. I you know it's bringing to mind a story about how and I wrote about this in my first book where I was on the beach with a friend of mine who's a very successful comedy writer and this was many years ago but he's gone on to be way more successful and I was read he spotted me reading a book about Buddhism and he said I don't think I could go down that path because I need to stay judgmental because my comedy comes from being judgmental but I wish that the technology worked that well that you could start meditating and you're not going to be judgmental or cranky or crazy or whatever all the What happens is you just get to be more familiar with the way the mind works. And so I think it can put your comedy on steroids because you can notice the judgment that's going to come inevitably. Um, and that instead of being owned by it, you can make a joke out of it. And that's really helpful. >> I really believe that you can find humor and laughter just about anywhere. And to prove it, in this next clip, we are going to find laughter in the literal dirt. That is right. In the ground where plants grow with Alexis Nicole Nelson talking about the joys and the comedy of foraging for wild plants. Also, I'm curious that about the times when people are surprised to see you doing what you're doing or foraging because they just don't understand what foraging is. Like, have you ever had someone spot you foraging and have a really strange or interesting reaction to that? >> Absolutely. My first year making Tik Toks, I was gathering some mugwart around this time of year and two women who were just power walking together stopped in their tracks and were just like, ""What are you doing?"" And I was just like, ""Oh, you know, just gathering some aromatic herbs. I wanted to roast some potatoes tonight and I needed some mugwart and here it is."" Honestly, it was a great interaction. and they had so many questions and for them it just wasn't it it was just not something they ever expected to see anybody doing. I think my identity maybe made it more surprising but even if it was someone their own age I think they would have been really surprised and those are always really delightful moments when people approach it with just like a childlike curiosity. I love those times. Uh there are definitely other times when people approach it from a point of apprehension being like, ""Oh my god, I don't know what that 6- foot tall, very loud, gregariously dressed black woman is doing, so I'm going to go ask her about it."" But I like to I like to think that usually I end up changing that apprehension to delight almost every time. It definitely hasn't worked every single time. >> Yeah. It's it's cool though to imagine like you think that you know the space and then you see someone doing something that you don't expect in the space and all of a sudden it's like wait a second that's edible that's delicious. That's a thing that's even there. I thought this was just a lawn or I thought this was a field. Exactly. We have become like so disconnected from food that to us when you think of food most people would think of like a grocery store or something bought from the grocery store. I think it it surprises people that people are finding food outside even though where else would it be growing? >> I used to teach at an elementary school. I taught fifth grade and I remember so clearly that one day we were reading a book. It wasn't even a science lesson or something. It was just a book where it kind of came up incidentally and it said like and they picked the lettuce out of the ground and the kids were like lettuce comes from the dirt. Oh, that's the most disgusting thing I've ever heard. It grows out of dirt. >> Which is like hilarious, of course. Like, you have to learn that at some point. But, but the other thing is, and I I feel like this is maybe uh I wonder if this is the the thing that must not be said in foraging circles. But I'm like, they also have kind of a point. It's a little gross that things come out of the dirt and that they're fed by poop and like rotting things. I'm like, you know what? It is gross and it's delicious and that's just how things work. >> And that's life, baby. [Laughter] It is delightful and it is often icky and there are usually bugs. That's life. >> That's a great phrase for life. I put that on a t-shirt. I'll buy that t-shirt. >> Le Bestnet is the founder of Public Works and the resident director at the Public Theater in New York City. Lear is a theater creator who thinks really deeply about spectacle. She cares so much about creating a big amazing moment that's memorable. And Lear doesn't just see that on stage. She sees it every day in New York City where she lives, whether it's on the subway or on the street outside of her office or outside of her home. And talking to her, it made me think about all of the hilarious, silly, truly absurd moments that happened to me growing up in New York City where Lear now lives. So, I grew up in New York City and my um I was obsessed for at least three or four years of my childhood with this street performer who performed at the South Street Seapport and her name was the squirrel lady. And what she would do, her act was she would stand on an upturned like like mail crate. And then if you gave her a dollar, she would take a sleeve of saltine crackers and she would just destroy eat them like a little squirrel. Like just like making like spraying saltine crackers everywhere. And I was like, ""That person is Michelangelo. That is my Dainci."" I was like, ""That is the greatest genius of our time."" And I would beg, constantly beg like, ""Can I have a dollar and can we please go see The Squirrel Lady?"" And to this day, I still think it's one of the most incredible pieces of art I've ever seen. >> Oh my gosh. Uh, well, thank you for sharing. This is now a new obsession of mine. And my question is like, is she available? Because I would like her to be in my next production. My belief is that she retired to some mansion funded by her squirrel performance. But I I haven't seen her in literally a decade, so I don't know. But >> yes, >> I if she was in a production, I would fly anywhere in the world for that ticket. I would certainly go. >> There is no limit to the um the types of performers you can find in New York City. But also more broadly to your point like in the world anywhere there are people who have these like little unusual strange things that would be perfect for spectacle. >> Yes. Yes. And my dream is to sort of walk through life noticing those things and then to ask a person to do like whatever that thing is to do like exactly that in the production and to somehow create the conditions within the story. whatever that person is doing makes sense in a storytelling way. That was my dream. >> Two people who have dedicated their careers to making sure that any story can be told are Dave Nadleberg and Neil Catcher, founders of Mortified, one of the funniest shows that I have ever seen in my life. It is a podcast. It is a live stage show. And what it is is getting people to share their tragically hilarious journal entries from when they were teenagers or middle schoolers. They read them aloud in front of a crowd and it transforms something that is often unbelievably cringeworthy and embarrassing into something that is hilarious and glorious and a form of art. It is so fun to witness one of their shows and talking to the people who have actually been on stage. It's so fun to watch this memory that often made you just like curl up and want to die transform into something that entertains other people and gets this big cathartic laugh. Here's how Neil and Dave do it. So I I have done stand up but I also started I was a fifth grade teacher and the thing that has influenced my life most from being a fifth grade teacher is the idea of a growth mindset right that like almost nothing about who we are is fixed that you can you maybe have natural abilities or talents but that you can build these muscles and I think a muscle that uh mortified is so great at showing is the muscle of like you can build the muscle of laughing at yourself. you can build the muscle of like taking this stuff and finding it to be funny and and transforming it into a strength rather than a a private shameful weakness. >> Yeah. Life is not always kind and so it's a very to you know it's a very comforting thing you know the reminder that we mess up and you know like you know and like the end of at the end of every Mortified podcast and stage show we say uh what did we learn? Well, we learned a million things but most of all we learned that we are freaks and we are fragile and we all survived. To me, I take all that to heart. It's not just like a piffy thing. Um because I think these are valuable. Like there is a lesson to that and you could whether that comes from a thing like mortified or um or whether you can apply that same logic to a million other things in life. Did I say life weird? I think I did. >> I think I said laugh. I I didn't even notice it as weird, but I love it. >> I have faith and better in the future though. >> Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, growth mindset. >> I want to leave you with a piece of a conversation that I had with the Palestinian peace activist, author, and travel company founder Aziz Abusara. Aziz works a lot on very dark, very heavy, and tragic issues, especially with the ongoing war in Gaza. But Aziz himself is anything but dark and depressing. He is light. He is hilarious. He's one of the funniest people I've ever met. Talking to Aziz, it really highlights for me the point that humor can be much more than just silly goofiness. It can be a coping mechanism. It can be a way to find the strength to survive something that is so unbelievably daunting. Now, obviously, not everyone is going to find humor in every situation. Of course not. But for some people, it can be a real way to transform sorrow, to transform grief, to transform tragedy into something where you have a momentary release, a way to let off some of the pressure and to find a way to move forward. you know, we got to spend a fair amount of time together in in Vancouver and I had it was such a pleasure to get to know you and to see your public talk, but also to have dinner with you and talk casually. And something that I've been thinking about since then when I think about our interactions is how there are ways that identity can really get flattened when we talk about these big issues like the conflict in in Palestine and Israel. There's this way in which you, for example, can be presented only as this very serious person, right? this victim of the conflict but also a peacemaker. But you are also so much more than that. You're hilarious. You're funny. You're complex. You're not any one thing. So, how do you personally push back against that? How do you push back against the the flattening that comes in with with the idea that you are a Palestinian and that is all that you are and you are the cultural image of Palestine rather than the actual person, the actual Palestinian you are. >> It's a challenge. It's a challenge I've faced through my whole career. One, I use a lot of humor in everything I do because that's part of who I am. And I uh if I was as brave as you, I would have done standup comedy more more often. I've done it a couple of times and man, it is so hard to to to put yourself out there and hope people will laugh in the first 30 seconds of speaking. >> Well, certainly there's one of the two of us that's brave. It it maybe that neither of us is brave but certainly it's not me. >> Nah, you are. You absolutely are. Uh but yeah, I try to definitely show that I am not only one identity. I don't want you to only look at Palestinians with pity or look at us only as victims. We are much more than that. I grew up like many many Palestinians loving poetry. I started writing poetry when I was seven or eight. It was terrible poetry, but I still wrote poetry when I was that young. I used to call the radio almost every week to read my poetry. Now I'm very embarrassed of the kind of poetry I read on the radio. But that's how you know our culture is so different than what people think. And often I get like oh your culture is so much a culture of death which is not the culture I grew up with. Uh you have people like Sam Kasim who wrote when the day I'm killed the my killer will rifle through my pockets and he'll find three tickets one to peace one to the one to the fields and the rain and one to the conscience of a humankind. I beg you my killer do not waste such a thing. Do not ignore these tickets. Take them. I beg you to travel. That is one of our most famous poem poets. And it's not a poem about glorifying death. It's telling his killer in a time where he feels so much conflict around him. I don't want this to continue. Even if the price is my death, I don't want you to live in this reality. And that's what I want the world to know. We not only victims. We not, you know, even in this hard moments and looking what's happening in Gaza and so much death and so much suffering and so much pain. If you only see people as victims if you only see them in one small box, it's much easier also to dehumanize them. It's much easier to not see them as as normal people who have dreams, who want to be teachers, want to be doctors, want to be comedians, want to be all these things. And that's what I want people to know about me. And I want people to know about Palestinians in general, Muslims, Arabs in America. That that's the I think that's where we start.

BeUTAFHlKQ0,"So let me ask you a question. How many of you do your banking,
your health care on your phones? Right, of course you do. How about like, your love life,
your entertainment, travel planning, all that kind of stuff? Right. How many of you vote on your phones? That's the problem. So I spent the first 15 years of my career working in US government and politics. City government, state government, federal government, you name it, I saw it from pretty much every angle. And the main thing
that I took away from it, really, more than anything else, is why politicians make
the decisions they make. Is it based on what they believe in? No. Is it what's best for their city
or their state or their country? Not really. How about what's best
for their constituents specifically? Not even that. It's actually a lot simpler. Virtually every politician
makes every decision solely based on winning the next election and nothing else. And that's true for the next election
and then the next election after that. (Applause) And it's a problem in democracies
all over the world, but it's especially pervasive
in the United States because we have this corrupt practice
known as gerrymandering. And what that allows
the two political parties to do is divvy up all the legislative districts
so that, as a result, the only election that ever
really matters is the party primary. Now we had a big election last fall. You guys might have heard
something about it. And in that election, about two thirds of Americans voted. But that was for president. I live in New York City. In 2023, we had city council primaries. Turnout was 7.2 percent. So I don't know if you guys
have ever been to New York, but if you have, you will know,
we are not a shy people. And yet, in this city of 8.5 million highly opinionated people, you could win a council seat
with just 8,000 votes. And the same thing is true
in state legislative races, congressional, mayoral, you name it, and it's true everywhere. So who are those voters? They're typically
the far right or the far left, or special interests that know
how to move money and votes in low-turnout elections. They dictate not only who wins office but then what happens
once they're in office. And that gets us one
of two types of government. Either the chaos and dysfunction
that we call Washington, DC, or totally one-sided governments, whether it's the state
of Texas on the right or the city of San Francisco on the left. And if we were truly hopelessly divided, if we just couldn't agree on any issue, that'd be one thing, but we're not. Most people agree
on the solutions to most issues, whether it's education
or health care or climate or taxes or let's take guns as an example. The vast majority of Americans would say that we should neither
confiscate everyone's guns, but nor should it be easy
to walk into a store and walk out with an assault rifle. But the problem is, those Americans,
the people in the center, the people in the middle,
they don't vote in primaries. So politicians ignore their views
and cater only to the extremes. And when the next school shooting happens, and it will happen, all of us are going to bang
our heads against the wall and say, Why can’t our politicians
just do the right thing for once?” Why? I'll tell you why. Because they're held
hostage by the extremes. They're stuck. We have to free them from their clutches. We have to make it possible
for them to move back to the middle. And the only way to do that
is to get a lot more people voting. And the only way to do that
is to meet the people where they are: on their phones. About a decade or so ago, I helped run a lot of the campaigns
around the US to legalize Uber. And I know that now
when you guys think of Uber, it's this giant corporation. But back then, we were a tiny
little tech startup, and taxi was this big, politically powerful industry
who really didn't like us. And we knew we couldn’t out-muscle them. And so instead, we turned to the people. And by making it possible
for our customers to tell their elected officials, ""Hey, I like this Uber thing,
please leave it alone,"" we were able to mobilize
millions of people through the app to advocate on our behalf. And when mayors and city council members started hearing from thousands
of their constituents, that's exactly what they did. They left Uber alone. It's how we won at basically
every market in the country. And while this was happening,
I just remember sitting there thinking, ""God bless these people. They're making my job a lot easier."" But my guess is they don't know
who their city council member is. They don't vote in state Senate primaries. And you know, why would they? They're busy, they have kids, they have jobs, they have lives. But when we made it really easy, when we let people reach their politicians
directly from their phones, everything changed. So what if we could vote this way? So in 2017, we created
the Mobile Voting Project. And the first thing we did was work
with election officials in seven states, red and blue, where either deployed military
or people with disabilities were able to vote
in real elections on their phones. Soldiers from West Virginia
stationed in Afghanistan. People who are blind in Denver. In one election in Seattle,
we let everyone participate. And after doing it for two years in a row, turnout tripled. Denver did a poll of those
who participated in their election, and 100 percent,
so every single respondent, said, ""Yeah, I like pressing a button
better than having to go somewhere."" Shocking, right? In other big news, water is wet,
and ice cream tastes good. (Laughter) But that was for specific
groups of voters. And we wanted everyone to be able
to vote securely on their phones. So four years ago, we started building our own
mobile voting technology. We're almost done, we're going to finish it this summer. And when we do, it's going to be free and open-source to any government
in the world that wants to use it. And to be clear, this is just
an additional way to vote. If you like voting by mail, vote by mail. If you like voting in person,
great, do that. Some people really like the ceremony
that comes with going somewhere and waiting in line and all of that. And if that happens to be you,
knock yourself out. But based on turnout,
that's not most of you. So let's give people another option. So as I mentioned before, and as you can probably tell
from my accent, I'm from New York, so I'm going to use that
as the example for how it works. I go on the App Store, and I download
the New York City Board of Elections app. And the first thing they do is say, OK, is Bradley really a registered voter
here in New York City? I put in my address. Fine. Next thing is multi-factor authentication. So you know how, like, when you forget your Google password,
they send you a code and you put it back into the app? Same thing here. Then we take a scan of your face, match that up against your government ID. And at this point we've fully established,
OK, Bradley is really Bradley. Ballot pops up on my screen, and the ballot itself
is simple and easy to use, and I go through it,
I take my time, no rush. Whenever I'm ready, I hit submit. And when I hit submit,
three things happen. First, my ballot is encrypted. Second, it's anonymized. Third, I get a tracking code,
like if it were a FedEx package, so I can track the progress of my ballot
all the way through the process. Then it goes back to the New York City
Board of Elections, and they air-gap it, which means they take it offline. And once my ballot is no longer
connected to the internet, then they decrypt it, a paper copy is printed out that gets mixed in
with all of the other ballots. I know where my ballot stands, because I can see from the tracking code
that it was received, tabulated, printed and so on. And the underlying code
itself is open source, which means that anyone can audit it. Anyone can verify it. It's totally transparent. To me, that's a lot more secure
than the way we vote right now. And we've already built it. We've already paid for it, and we're giving it away
to anyone who wants to use it for free. (Applause and cheers) And with a little more work,
I think we could do even more. We could register people
to vote on the app. We could give voters
nonpartisan information about candidates or ballot measures so you actually know
what you're voting on. And versions of this already do exist. Mobile voting in a way, exists in Estonia. They use it in party elections in the UK. Some municipalities here in Canada use it. But not in the US,
and not in most democracies. And that's where
the hard part really kicks in: getting politicians to let us use
our phones to vote in elections, because in my experience, people in power don't like
making it easier for other people to gain power. And that's -- Yeah, exactly. (Applause) And that's why I'm here. Because they're not just
going to do it if I ask nicely. They're not just going to do it
if I snarl at libertarians on X or at the liberals on Bluesky. They're only going to do it
if you make it happen. If we all make it happen. And we can. Every major right that has ever
been won, anywhere: the right to vote, the Civil Rights Act,
the Americans with Disabilities Act, same-sex marriage, anything, has only happened because enough people
stood up loud enough and long enough and demanded their rights, and eventually the status quo
had to give in. And we can do that here, too. We can make voting easier
and a lot more secure. We can bring regular people
back into the process. We can take power away from the extremes. We can end the dysfunction
and polarization that plagues our society today. We can give our politicians the cover
and the courage they need to work together and to finally, finally get things done. We can do all of this
in the next ten years. We can do it with mobile voting. Thank you.

443yrCLHf8s,"English is taking over. I can tell that we're getting to the point where a question is going to start being asked which is why should we learn foreign languages other than if English happens to be foreign to one. I think there are a lot of reasons. One reason to learn them is because they are tickets to being able to participate in the culture of the people who speak them just by virtue of the fact that it is their code. Second reason, it's been shown that if you speak two languages, dementia is less likely to set in and that you are probably a better multitasker. Bilingualism is healthy. And then third, languages are just an awful lot of fun, much more fun than we're often told. So for example, Arabic, Kataba, he wrote, Yubu, he writes, she writes, ukub right in the imperative. What do those things have in common? All of those things have in common the consonants sitting in the middle like pillars. They stay still and the vowels dance around the consonants. Who wouldn't want to roll that around in their mouth? Languages have different word orders. Learning how to speak with different word order is like driving on the different side of the street if you go to a certain country. So for example, the cat in the hat comes back. One phrase in it is do you know where I found him? Do you know where he was? He was eating cake in the tub. Yes, he was fine. Now if you learn that in Mandarin Chinese, then you have to master you can know. I did wear him. Fine. He was tub inside. Gorging cake. No mistake. gorging, chewing, that just feels good. Imagine being able to do that for years and years at a time. I highly recommend that you teach yourself languages other than the one that I'm speaking. It won't change your mind, but it will most certainly blow your",unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
L_3KmTevD5o,"On a cold but sunny autumn afternoon, I was riding on the back
of my husband's motorcycle, just cruising along one of our favorite
routes around Newcastle. It was a pretty fresh day, so we were all rugged up
in our protective gear. At a set of red lights, my husband lifted his visor
and he said to me, ""Hey, come feel my handles."" So naturally, I reached for his hips
and gave them a playful squeeze and said, ""These handles are perfect, baby."" What he, of course meant
was his heated motorcycle handles, not his love handles. Yeah, a classic
and genuine misunderstanding. And lucky we both have good humor, otherwise this could have
ended in an argument. But interactions like these happen
every day in intercultural relationships. This is not unique to us, of course. In fact, one third of Australian
marriages are intercultural these days, according to the ABS. Which means we've never been more
intimately connected across the globe than we are right now. What I didn't tell you so far
is that I'm from Austria, so my first language is Austrian German, and my husband is from Australia,
so he speaks English. So these kinds of conversations,
misunderstandings, long explanations of jokes and words shape our relationship. By a show of hands, who in here knows
at least one intercultural couple? Maybe it's even you. Yeah, exactly. Now in my research
with intercultural couples, I found many beautiful aspects of having two different
languages amongst partners, but also quite a few challenges that monolingual couples
don't necessarily have to face. Let me ask you this. If you cannot flawlessly communicate with the person you want
to be closest to in this world, how does that affect your relationship? This is what I'm going
to answer for you today. I speak six languages, and I focus my studies in linguistics. And I worked with intercultural couples
to uncover their language behavior and their dynamic. So let me take you on a journey today through the science behind all
of these ""love handles"" stories out there. I'm going to let you in
on three specific challenges that intercultural partners
have to face on a daily basis, but sometimes don't even know
that they're facing them. Some of these are very, very hidden. Now I'm focusing mostly
on romantic relationships here, but you can apply this equally
to intercultural friends or even workplace encounters. Oddly, these domains sometimes overlap. The first challenge I'd like
to share with you today is how different languages carry
different emotional weights for people. What does that mean? It basically means that when I say
""I love you"" in English, it doesn't feel the same
as saying ""ich liebe dich"" for me as a German speaker. That's because language
isn't just a tool for communication. It shapes our emotional experience, and our first language
usually evokes the strongest one. That's why a declaration of love, which is such an emotionally
charged statement, usually holds more weight
for someone in their first language than in any language
learned later in life. Now I grew up with the words
“ich liebe dich” from my parents, so over the years of my life, these have gained an emotional weight beyond what any other language
can achieve for me. So what does that mean
for intercultural partners now? Imagine a Japanese-French couple,
and they speak English together. Are they unable to communicate
the true strength of their feelings because of this language distance? Now my husband and I,
we mostly speak English together. Does that mean when I say
""I love you"" in English, it means less because
I'm emotionally detached from it? We can observe this also
with other emotions. For example, something
that comes up in relationships? Anger, frustration. Now with anger, it's very often a totally
different experience in English. It's very often the impact
that matters more instead of the words. It's the classic, ""Honey, it's not what you said,
it's how you said it."" Sound familiar? Yeah. Let me give you an example. Early on in my relationship, during an argument,
I dropped a certain C-word. I'm not going to say
what it is, you all know. Now at that time in my relationship, I had no grasp how offensive
that word is in English. To me, it was just
four letters string together. Just something I heard
around the street here in Australia. (Laughter) I had no emotional connection to it. But my husband,
he was shocked and rightly so. I've never used it since in any context. (Laughter) But that's the thing, when intercultural partners fight, we have to think of many things here. Is the word choice right? Mine clearly wasn't. How does that word land
on the other person? So what's the impact? Mine was clearly horrible and misdirected. And thirdly, what is
the delivery of it all? So what's the intonation? Is it too strong, too weak? And that's where intercultural partners, they bring their language background, they bring their cultural
background to one table and have to negotiate this
in a heated moment, at the same time. There's too much happening. Now fighting is already difficult
with monolingual partners, but adding all of these elements, that requires a lot of communication. But let's be honest,
who actually sits down to determine the terms of a fight before a fight, right? It doesn't happen. The second challenge I'd like to share
with you today is humor. Making each other laugh
is a big part of relationships, but humor often
doesn't translate very well. Sometimes a joke is funny in one language,
but it falls flat in another. Or it could be quite offensive. Now linguistically, we can break this down into two parts: into receiving humor and producing humor. From a receiving side, a partner might feel unsure if they grasp
the true meaning of a joke or just a superficial facet thereof. That could be a purely linguistic issue, like not picking up on sarcasm
or not recognizing a pun because the language skills
just aren't there yet. There's also the cultural
aspect, of course. Partners with different
language backgrounds naturally grew up
in different in-groups of a joke. So the people that understand a joke
and the people that don't. I never understood why the Aussie phrase ""shrimp on a barbie""
isn't actually funny to Australians. It actually quite annoys them. My husband doesn't understand
why the super cringey, nostalgic '90s TV show ""Liebesg'schichten und Heiratssachen"" is so hilarious to me. (Laughter) Different in-groups. That means that intercultural partners have limited common ground
to work with here. And if one partner
doesn't understand the joke, the other is stuck trying
to explain it to them. And that conversation is never funny. From a producing side, we all know that producing humor
in a second language is an incredibly
difficult skill to master. There are so many elements to get right. The subtext of a joke, the punchline,
the context, the delivery, all while making sure
that it's appropriate and, well, funny. Right? Now in my research
with intercultural couples, they all confirmed
that they feel less funny when joking in a second language
with their partners. Can you imagine what
that does to your self-esteem and to your couple dynamic? In one particular interview, one of the male participants
said about his wife, ""I don't think she's ever
made me laugh in English. She's a German speaker."" Now these sentiments aren’t uncommon. Even I can attest to that. I always felt that I was effortlessly
hilarious in Austrian German, but I couldn't bring
that same energy to English, and I was so disheartened
that my husband would never know the true comedic genius
his wife actually is. (Laughter) Such a tragedy. (Laughter) But that's the problem here. Humor, or the lack thereof,
can create distance between partners. It can stop us from truly
knowing each other. I've left the last challenge for you, which I find the most interesting one, and it is also the most hidden one. It is something couples deal with and it is so subtle,
they very often don't even notice. And it is the hidden power dynamics
between intercultural partners. From a pure language perspective, and we're only talking language here, there is always a partner
who is linguistically superior and someone who is inferior. You might think now, well, it's the one who speaks
the language better, right? That can be one aspect,
but it's not quite that simple. There is many more
layers and facets to it. You are correct though,
one aspect is language proficiency. Now even though my English skills
are really good and high, my husband is a native speaker. He will always be more proficient
in English than I am. And that puts him at an advantage
in a lot of situations. He's the one who manages all
of our contracts. He's the one who explains vocabulary
to me during movies when I don't understand. All of this isn't a big deal, of course, but in some ways, it flows
into the dynamic of our relationship because I am linguistically
dependent on him. And that is something we never
notice on a daily basis. It's extremely apparent, though,
when we have an argument. We're having all these heated
discussions in English, my second language, his first language. After a day of processing
life and work and emotions and conversations in English, it takes me double the energy to find the right words
in these heated moments. His responses are immediate, but I would very often just like to say, ""Thank you for your response. I will get back to you
in three to five business days."" (Laughter) So you see, the partner
with the higher language proficiency does have the upper hand here. But like I said,
there’s other factors, too. There's also the global status
of the language in use amongst partners. Now global player languages
like English, Spanish, Mandarin, they are viewed as superior
in comparison to lesser-spoken languages. So couples naturally
gravitate towards them. Again, English versus Austrian German? I'm not winning so far. The dominant global status of English
will always take preference, and that flows into the dynamic
of our relationship. Because we're not speaking my language
as much as I'd like to. But one factor we cannot
forget is the linguistic environment where a couple chooses
to live or the country. Now in Australia,
a native speaker like my husband is in his linguistic comfort zone. But if you remove that safe environment, the power dynamics can very much change. As soon as we travel to Austria, suddenly, I'm the one
ordering food at restaurants. I'm the one translating at family events. The roles reverse. So the power dynamics
are not just defined by the couple itself but also by their surroundings. I've presented you with a range
of hidden language challenges now that intercultural partners
face on a daily basis. And I think it's pretty apparent: dealing with two different
languages here is tricky. You might be asking yourself right now,
so what's the solution? What can we do? The bad news is that these things
never really go away, no matter how long
your relationship lasts. My husband and I, we've been together
for nine years now, and we still struggle
with most of these things. The good news is that I can give you
two very simple recommendations today. The first one is awareness. Be aware that your emotions
can be guided by your language, love, anger and everything in between. Be aware that your humor is rooted
in your cultural background, and it sometimes doesn't translate
in another language. And be aware that your language skills
and your surroundings can raise or lower your linguistic
power over your partner. Because if you're conscious
that these things are happening for you behind the scenes, you'll realize that these things are also
happening for your partner. And only then you can work
on my second recommendation together. And that is actively
build your microculture. Your microculture is your perfect blend
of both your cultures, your habits, your traditions and your languages. So build your love language. Invent new words that don't exist. Switch between your languages
as much as possible. Define your own humor. Get your own insider jokes. Define your own comedic language. That's the humor that counts. And work towards an equal power dynamic. Give each other chances to grow
in each other's languages and countries. What I want you to take away today is that all these challenges are tricky, but they're also an opportunity to evolve. No matter if it's
with an intercultural friend or at work or in a romantic relationship. Love is hard in a second language,
but it's definitely worth it. I’m sure you’ll all “handle” it, too. Thank you.

ZhruqkPeJ6o,"So I have a confession to make,
and it’s that, for many of you, you'll know when the IPCC reports
come out every year, the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change telling us where we are
with climate change and where we're going. And there's this flood
of headlines, right? You've probably all seen them. Often, I don't click on those stories. I don't read them. And I'm a journalist, so this is an embarrassing thing to admit. And it's not because I don't think
this work is amazing or I don't think the IPCC is amazing. I really, really do. But I also know why I'm not
clicking on those stories. And I think it's probably for reasons
a lot of people don't click on them. They scare the crap out of me. Sometimes, when you work
on this stuff all the time, you think, ""Well, we're screwed."" Like, ""Tell me something else
I don't know."" Or it can be technical, it can be overwhelming. People feel like they have
so much on their plate. Why are they going to look
at these stories? So that's a challenge. It's a challenge for journalists,
but it's also a challenge for all of us, because I think the more
that we know about climate change, the more that we read
or consume climate-change news, the more that we know
about climate change. So I work at the Reuters Institute, and our researchers saw,
in eight countries, when people consumed climate news
weekly instead of monthly, you know, they know things like ""Climate change
is affecting my health right now, instead of in the future."" Or, you know, ""Rich,
more polluting countries bear more responsibility
for climate change than the poor ones
who did less to cause it."" But we know that the more
they consume climate-change news, the more that they actually know. So I'm from Calgary, Alberta. It's an oil and gas city. I'm from an oil and gas family, and I got into covering climate change
because I covered the energy industry, I covered the big oil and gas companies. And when I was covering climate change, I could see that I was having
the same problem. I could see that people
weren't clicking or reading my stories. Sometimes, as a journalist, you see behind
the veil of what people are clicking on. It’s a very traumatic experience. So it was so traumatic, I left my job. And in 2022, I joined a new project, called the Oxford Climate
Journalism Network, which is at the Reuters Institute
for the Study of Journalism at the University of Oxford. And it was set up by our cofounders with this idea that climate
is really a lens -- it's not an angle, it's not a beat. It's something
that goes across everything, And that's how we,
as journalists, should cover it. So every six months, we get 100 journalists
in a kind of a virtual room. They come from 50 to 60 countries, and they come from all different
positions in the newsroom. You know, they’re editors-in-chiefs and people in economics,
finance, sports, culture, as well as loads of climate experts. And we get them in a room, and over the course of six months, we look at climate
from loads of different angles. We look at it from the science,
the finance, but also, we look at culture, we look at sports, and this kind of helps people
on all these different desks question their assumptions. So that's kind of a brilliant approach. So, OK, first of all, it's not just me who does this work,
there's a team of us. There's my boss, Mitali Mukherjee, there’s my colleagues 
Diego Arguedas Ortiz and Greg Cochrane. And now, three years in,
we're at 600 journalists, and we kind of often say,
like when we started out, we were pretty honest that we just had
questions about this kind of stuff. We didn't really have that many answers. And now, we're going into our fourth year. We have a few places
that we like to start, and many of you aren't journalists, but you can probably use this
in your own lives and your own industries. So one place we start
is called Find Your Mango. So this comes from an Egyptian
editor called Suzy. And we had a discussion about, you know, why weren't the mangoes as good
in Egypt this year? Why weren't they as tasty? It was climate change, of course. And then we went around the room, and looked at, like,
what's the mango in your country? Diego's Costa Rican, it's coffee for him. Where I'm from, it's skiing. You know, it's durian,
it's mushroom picking, it's football, and in a lot of the world,
it's mangoes as well. But it's all these things
that connect us to climate, and we often talk
about lives and livelihoods. These things are so important. But it's also sports, food, culture, the things that really
make our lives worth living, and the things that are
really important to us. The second thing is that climate
coverage is contagious. And once you start looking
for climate coverage in your newsroom, you can find it all kinds
of different places. So sometimes, people come to Diego and I, and they say, ""We're going
to start a climate desk, or should we hire reporters,
or what should we do?"" And we say, ""What other
newsrooms have done, a lot of the time
is they've taken an inventory, and they look at what
they're already doing, and often, there's way more
than you would expect."" So local reporters, you know,
they're covering water issues, they're covering city-hall questions. Business reporters
are covering energy prices. They're covering insurance. Sports reporters are covering, like,
when it is too hot to have, you know, a kids' Little League game,
this kind of thing. And actually, journalists are doing this. So one great example is AFP, where they have a style guide
that connects, you know, extreme weather events with when they can connect it
to climate change. What's the link that they can make, which is something a lot of journalists
are grappling with. And Ivan Couronne, who is in charge
of the climate strategy at AFP, is one of our members. He's also in charge of kind of bringing
climate training to everybody in AFP. And this is something
a lot of newsrooms are doing. And what they’ve realized, it's not always about
the big climate story, right? It's often about taking these stories, adding a little bit of context,
a line, a paragraph. It's all about, like, connecting the dots, giving the readers
and the audience that context. So the third thing
we suggest is ""be proactive."" A lot of climate coverage, it used to be the science reporters
were sitting over here, they knew what was going on,
they had this very difficult job. And then, every time
there was a climate disaster, it was over here,
bang, bang, react, react. And we weren't often
making this connection. But the world has changed. And we know this stuff is coming. So I'm Canadian, we know
the wildfires are coming. For most of the world, we know the extreme heat
is coming every single year. And if we know stuff is coming, like,
we have no excuse not to kind of prepare. And not just in the really long term, but, like, you know,
for next month or next summer. And this is also something
newsrooms are doing. And we often compare it to, like,
the Olympics or the election. So in the Indian elections
earlier this year, you know, extreme heat was a huge factor
for the people in the polling booths, but also for the journalists
who were covering it, who were often getting heatstroke. But it was also an issue
in Paris this summer. What does it mean
if it's 40 degrees in Paris, which is super likely? What does it mean for the athletes,
what does it mean for the crowds? So when I say this, I often
like to mention a couple stories that I really love. One of them is a story called
""The Great Electrician Shortage"" by David Owen at ""The New Yorker."" And it's a story about how, in the energy transition,
we need to electrify everything, right? So we need loads of electricians. And it's a story about the energy
transition and climate change, but it's also a story about job choices
and the labor market, and what people should do
with their lives, and what you should study at university. And another thing I like to mention is a little series
called ""Climate Heroes,"" which is at the Irish
public broadcaster RTÉ, under a lovely guy called Philip Bromwell, who's also an alumnus of ours. And there are these little
social-first videos -- you know, very, very short. And they're about people doing stuff
in their communities. So they're about a climate comedian
going on the road, about a professional rugby player
turned climate activist. There's loads of biodiversity stories. There's loads of stories
about local businesses changing how they deal with waste. And they're, like, very easy to binge, and they make you feel good. And the question there is not really about ""Should we not do
the big, hard-hitting stuff, should we not cover the IPCC?"" It's like, ""This is so big now,
we should do both."" And a lot of these stories,
as simple as they seem, they go back to something I was taught
when I started journalism school, which is what one of my first professors would have us write
on the top of the paper. He'd say, ""A story is someone
doing something, because."" Someone needs to be doing something. There needs to be agency.
Something needs to be happening. So when I say all of this, it sounds super simple,
and, like, “Oh, it’s so easy.” And obviously, in a lot of this work, it can feel like the boundary
for success is so high. It's stopping climate change, right? So anything short of that
can feel like a failure. And I think that's something
that climate journalists are grappling with every day,
what that feels like. But just because the boundary
is so high for journalists, when we're looking
at what's our role here, and it's providing good,
useful information, can help people make really tangible,
really important choices about their lives. About is it safe to go to the park today
with their kids, is it too hot? What should they do with their careers? What does the future kind of hold? These are really tangible decisions. So I think when we look at those,
these are places that we can start. We can start by remembering
what's really important to the audience, we can be proactive,
and we can make connections. And these are things that I hope
will help connect with audiences and make it a little bit harder
for people to look away. So thanks so much. (Applause)",unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tpa7eWBoPdg,"Jacqueline Novogratz: I am so excited
to have this conversation with Sitoyo. For so many reasons,
but three that I'll start with. First of all, he disrupted
the first two industries I worked in. I started off in traditional banking and then in 1986, co-founded the first
microfinance bank in Rwanda. Both disrupted by M-PESA. For the last 25 years, I've been investing in social enterprises
focused on solving problems of poverty. And for the last 20, M-PESA has fundamentally accelerated them. And the second reason is what
John McWhorter talks about: the unexpected. As Juliana [Rotich] said,
M-PESA was founded in Kenya. What’s so extraordinary is this is 2007,
which was the year of the iPhone and when IBM introduced Watson. It was the year of Kindle and Airbnb. And not enough people
paid attention to this notion that cell phone banking could be a thing. It would take years
before the United States and China took it on themselves. And now, when I'm in Nairobi, I can buy a banana
or a roasted corn on the street in ways that in New York,
often at restaurants, I still can't. I need my credit card. And so it has fundamentally
transformed society. The third, which we're going to get to,
is the moral imagination. Sitoyo and I share a belief that what we need in the world
are social entrepreneurs who are using business
grounded in moral imagination. In other words, they are
fundamentally designed from the perspective of those
they are here to serve, particularly the overlooked
and the underestimated. And M-PESA has done that
like very few other social enterprises. So thank you for this conversation. And let's start at the beginning, Sitoyo. Sitoyo Lopokoiyit:
First, it's great to be here and apologies for disrupting you twice. (Laughter) I think, you know, in your journey, you've always talked
about patient capital. So I think the patience paid off, and I think we came good for you. I think for M-PESA,
it started with two insights. And I think that's the DNA of M-PESA. Before we launched in 2007, we were piloting
with a microfinance institution, with a women-only group, which we were trying
to give out loans to the women and then see what happens. And what was happening is, for example,
you were sending to her the SMS, in that pilot, that’s the first insight we had. And the second insight that came is a challenge that Kenya had
with regards to rural-urban migration. So people in the urban areas
wanted to send money back home or to their families, to their friends,
or to do farming, as an example. And the only way they could do that
is physical money. So if I wanted to send money to my mother, who is 500 kilometers away from Nairobi, I would write a letter,
then put money into it and look at it in the light. Just make sure you can't see the money. You give it to a bus driver, and then the next day,
she would go and pick it. And those two insights combined to create our first proposition,
""send money home."" And that's how M-PESA
started 18 years ago. And one thing was, how do you ensure
that somebody in rural Kenya, with very little education
or no education, can receive an SMS and knows it's money. And if it's deleted, she has a confidence
that the money is there. Or if she loses her phone,
she knows the money is there. So what we did,
we built an agent network. And this is a simple mom-and-pop shop, and we mapped it to Coca-Cola. That in every little village
is a Coca-Cola shop. So in every little place
we put M-PESA agent outlets. And that meant, when you
receive the money on SMS, you would actually go
to an agent and cash it out. And that built trust on M-PESA. And that’s how today
we have over 700,000 agents, and we employ directly 1.5 million people
in our agent network. (Applause) JN: And could you even go
beyond jobs, Sitoyo, and talk about the overall
stats, if you will, the impact that M-PESA has today? SL: Yeah, I think first we started
with the ""send money home"" proposition. And then looking at insights, ideas in terms of looking
at what customers are doing. And we moved to a payment proposition for utilities, water, electricity. Now we've moved into,
you know, savings, lending, credit, wealth management,
international money transfers. Today we connect -- you can send money
from over 200 countries into Kenya. I can send money,
I can bet in this whole audience, I can send money
to your bank account directly, it's over three billion
bank accounts you can send to or to any mobile money platform. And we are connecting families across. In terms of international money transfer, we've dropped that down
from highs of 10 to 15 percent to right now, we are at SDG level, which is about three percent from that. And then we moved
into the more, you know, the growth area which is
impacting the economy. We're now from governments, to the stock exchange,
multinationals, Coca-Cola, all these guys run on M-PESA. And then we've digitized
SMEs and micro SMEs. JN: I want to get into all of this stuff. But I just want to give the high line,
which is, what, 1.5 billion dollars a day, 60 million customers. SL: We're shy in saying the numbers, but it's over 400 billion dollars of value
going through the ecosystem. JN: Just. (Applause) You're so humble. SL: It's 180 million transactions. In most of the markets it's between 30, markets like Kenya, it's over 60 percent
of the GDP of the country is flowing through M-PESA ecosystem. So it's really transformative
in terms of -- (Applause) And we in terms of,
let's say, just lending, we lend over 50 million dollars a day, with NPLs below three percent which is unheard of anywhere in the world. (Applause) JN: So I want to get back
to the moral imagination, because this is a massive company. To go into the offices
of M-PESA, Safaricom, where it's housed, is like going into a central bank. Sixty percent of GDP, and there’s a lot of security
to get in as well. But you started off thinking
you would be a nonprofit, a true social enterprise that started off with
a two-million-pound grant. And it's a really important point for all
the social entrepreneurs in this room and the philanthropists, because we need the right kind of capital to enable people like Sitoyo to build markets that have never existed,
particularly for low-income people. And that takes experimentation
and failures and starting over again. You've continued with that sense
of the moral imagination to see yourselves not just to make money, although you make plenty of money, but to solve social problems and to really understand
who your customers are, even though, especially because, they might make one
or two or three dollars a day. Could you give me some examples of where that has continued
to fuel who you are and how you operate? SL: Yeah, I think for us it's -- first, every single day
I walk into the office, it's like the first day at work. And I've been in M-PESA
for a very, very long time. And it's because we enter
there every single day trying to solve real-life problems, we look at insights,
we innovate around that. And this is a great audience. I think we can do an experiment here. So just close our eyes for one second. Please close your eyes. Remove your phone. You can close your eyes, remove your phone and read the last message you had. OK, now you can open them. How many people could do that? So just imagine, in Kenya today, there’s six million
visually impaired people, and one million people are blind. Now how do those people who are excluded get to do financial services with dignity? And in 2018, we got to work with a fantastic
company from South Korea called the Braille Company. And we built the first Braille Dot Watch for visually impaired people in Kenya. And this is the watch
that I'm wearing today. (Applause) And that meant that over a million people now can access financial
services with dignity. And that DNA of how we create
products and services is what we carry on till today. JN: In a moment of history where we have so little
forgiveness, seemingly, something I've learned in 40 years
of working in and out of Africa is that quality of forgiveness, and you've integrated that as well. Just, in 20 seconds or less, say something about
the financial inclusion fund. SL: So it’s about two years ago, we created something
called the Hustler Fund in collaboration with government. And the government wanted everyone
above 18 to have a clean slate. And we worked with them,
and they removed nine million people from the Credit Reference Bureau and gave them a fresh start
to rebuild their credit. And with that, over 20 million Kenyans
got back access to financial services, from a clean slate. JN: We need this kind of thinking today. I want to move to the adjacent possible
because M-PESA has essentially created economic rails, a whole platform on which many
other industries can be built. We've seen it in energy
and agriculture and health care and just want to have a conversation about how you've seen
these adjacencies evolve. SL: I think this is great. I think when we opened
the M-PESA ecosystem and opened the API, allowed more
innovation to come into M-PESA, and I strongly believe there’s more
innovation outside M-PESA than there is in M-PESA. And the clean energy example,
which you are part of, is an example. I think you should talk
a little bit more about that, because you've impacted
over 300 million people globally with access to clean energy
through pay-as-you-go solar systems. JN: Well, thank you. It's actually an interesting story
that needs to be told, especially in the world today as we're looking at so many
frontier markets. But the same year that M-PESA started, a company called d.light
started with a solar light and this dream of eradicating kerosene. At the time, people had
to pay daily for kerosene. Like M-PESA, they had to build trust, understand the technology,
build distribution, etc. The big area of friction was financing, and for four years, the company struggled. 2011, M-PESA, for the first time,
married mobile payments with off-grid solar electrification. So now you could bring
electricity into your house and pay for electricity the way
you used to pay for dirty kerosene, except that you paid it
through your phone. Every day, 50 cents, and if you didn't make your monthly
payments by the end of the month, the solar company could call you and maybe offer you grace or shut down your unit. That was game on solar energy revolution because of the railways of M-PESA. And as Sitoyo said, our 40 companies
have now brought electricity to 300 million people. It wouldn't have happened without this pay-as-you-go
mobile payments system. And that's been just extraordinary. SL: And just what
you're saying in agriculture. So we’ve worked with the Kenyan government to digitize the whole
fertilizer-subsidy program. So they're subsidizing production, not consumption. And through M-PESA,
you get to register as a farmer, you get to put the location,
what's your size and what you're planting. And you get information,
you get a voucher, you pay on M-PESA. And government is selling
fertilizers directly to citizens. Today, over 288 million dollars
of fertilizers being sold through the platform. In 2022, there were 1.4 million farmers. Today, there’s 6 million farmers on it. Production is up 39 percent. Importation of maize is down 23 percent. And farmers are making a better living. And this accounts, in agriculture,
accounts for 30 to 40 percent of the GDP. And most of that is by small-scale farmers who have between one
to five acres of land. And we're impacting
and making their lives better. JN: You've also -- (Applause) Agriculture is also historically
a cash-based industry where there's been a lot
of what they call leakage, petty corruption, and you've also
significantly reduced that. And through our agricultural investing,
we've seen just massive changes. So thank you for that work as well. In the interest of time, because Sitoyo and I share, and so does Juliana, a mentor
and someone we have all been imprinted by, one of the great
moral leaders of our time, a man named Bob Collymore,
who ran Safaricom. And in this time where we keep
looking around to say, where are our leaders, Bob stands as a giant, though we lost him tragically
far too young a few years ago. Sitoyo, you're an African. You have built one of the most
important companies in the world. You see a continent that is going
to comprise one in four of us, with a median age of 19. How do you think about AI, the future, Africa's contribution in the context of the kind of moral
leadership that Bob demonstrated for us? SL: Now, first, I think,
you know, Africa is rising, as you've mentioned, the population, 30 percent of it is middle class. That's over 300 million people. And for this continent
to continue succeeding, it's open for trade. And that's something
that's really important for us. And the part of just understanding
what the continent needs is very important. And when we look at AI, I mean, there's fantastic use cases, anti money-laundering, cyber security, you know, agriculture,
health and so on and so forth. But for me personally, I think
we need to put sort of a handbrake on AI. And the reason for that
is we need to open it up, build algorithms
that are relevant to Africa and not just transport
the algorithms there. Because I strongly feel
that if we don’t do that, it'll be a form of colonization, colonialism at a scale
that we've never seen before. And it is really important -- (Applause) That we manage that challenge,
from that perspective, because it's like we are racing
to a finish line that's vanishing. And for Africa, we need to ensure that the solutions that are brought in make an impact to the lives
of the people on the society in which we operate in. And that's very important to me. And for the leadership part, I think I take from Bob, he used
to quote Dr. Seuss all the time and say a person is a person,
no matter how small. And that's such a profound statement, that we should be able to look
at everybody individually and actually listen to them and try and make an impact in their lives. (Applause) JN: I think that's a great note to end on. Also that corporate CEOs like Bob, like you, my friend, Sitoyo, have a role to play in the world today
to stand up for those who are overlooked, underestimated and who we desperately need
to be realizing their human potential. And it is such an honor
to know you, to work with you, to be accelerated by you. Thank you. SL: Thank you very much.

oTY_r-N49DA,"You're watching How to be a Better Human. I am your host, Chris Duffy. And when it comes to fashion, my number one request for my clothing is that it is kind of innocuous. I don't want anyone to comment on my clothing. Now, today's guest, Diara Buso, is very much the opposite. She wears beautiful, big, fashionable clothes. And that is partly because she runs a fashion technology company called Diara Blue. So, she's supposed to look good in her clothes. She's supposed to make clothes that make other people look good. And guess what? She does. But how does she do it? She does it in a really interesting way because it's not only clothes that are beautiful, it's also clothes that are responsible, but take care of the people who work for her and that take care of the planet by creating far less waste than typical fashion. How does she do all that? Well, you're going to have to watch the episode to find out. Hi everyone, my name is Diar Buso. I'm the founder of Diara Blue, a fashion and lifestyle brand rooted in sustainability. and my work focuses on how to use technology to humanize artistic expression. Can you tell us about um your background and what got you interested in sustainable design in the first place? I grew up in Sagal. That's where my family is from. And I grew up in an artisan family. So like my dad was a banker, but like he was the only one who's ever gone to school in his whole family at the time like elementary school. And he made it as far of you know being a banker and being very successful. But all his siblings, all my cousins work in the artisan world, especially leather. So I grew up around the world of sustainability. As a matter of fact, in my in my in my culture, there's no word for it. The closest thing is maybe life or common sense because you just if you love something, you protect it. So I grew up seeing resources. I grew up seeing people, you know, producing everything by hand, reusing every single part of like if you want to make a leather bag, you'll use the the cow skin for the bag. The meat is using for food. the horns are going to be used for something like nothing goes to waste and things were also made to last for a very long time. So like if a dress was being made it was made intentionally to be size inclusive and adjustable so you'd have extra straps or elastics so that you could pass it across different people or generations. Growing up I always wanted to be in the creative world uh but I didn't have the courage. So I went and pursued finance and math cuz I was like if my dad is so successful and he's a banker if I'm a banker I will be successful too. So kind of buried my creative dreams and pursued that route and started on Wall Street. And I think I went through a quarter life crisis for 5 years between 23 and 28 where I became a painter, then I became a photographer, then I became a world traveler, then I became a cook, and then I became a math teacher. And I was like, this is it. This is what I want to do. And little did I know being in the math classroom and teaching math is what would kind of connect my two worlds in terms of science and art. And I started using math to design textiles. And that's what led to to this company. Tell me more about um the the connection between math and textiles because I think that's often really surprising for people. Yeah. I mean, at the end of the day, textiles are just patterns, right? Um art, drawing, sketches, everything is just a pattern. And I think for me who didn't get trained formally in the art world. I got trained very formally in the math world and geometry and all of that stuff. But even as a student or in finance, math was very much like related to the finance world. I I never saw it as a creative um thing. And then I became a teacher and I realized that most students absolutely hate math. My first job as was an assistant. I was working in a school where all the kids who were failing math from 6th to 12th grade would come to me instead of going to math class. So I would like help them with their homework. And I started realizing they don't hate math. They hate how they are taught. When you make it fun and make it creative and it's like you know if somebody likes music I be like okay let's look at the lyrics of this song and count and look at the pattern there. If somebody likes drawing okay let's look at this flower and see what equations create this curve. So I kind of just found a way to gamify the whole math experience. And in the process of doing so, I realized that I was teaching myself um how to connect math to patterns. And on my free time, I would use the same math I was teaching them to create shapes. It's how it started. It was honestly just for fun. And the intention was to help kids like math better. And then it turned into using it for work. You know, I I taught um fifth grade and an elementary school. And I I loved being in school as a student, but I always just really struggled with math. That was my hardest topic. And I was surprised as a teacher to find that actually math was my favorite thing to teach because the fact that I had struggled with it made it so that I really understood like how to explain it because if I could understand it, then they would too. And it was actually really hard to teach them like writing because I kind of naturally understood writing better. So I'd be like, ""Well, you just make the sentence sound good."" And they'd be like, ""But what does that mean? What does that mean?"" Whereas with math, I could say, ""Here's why division works in this particular way."" I didn't understand it either until I saw this. And I imagine that you probably had a similar experience of there's something really nice about how with math the pieces click into place and you understand like this builds on this, builds on this. Yeah. It's kind of like a puzzle. I think the satisfaction of understanding something is universal, right? Like when somebody struggle with something and then they find a way to make it click. It's like when you're solving a puzzle for hours and then finally it works and they match. It's such a big feeling and I think I was able to get them to feel that way with art. It's like connecting math to patterns and art. And I think I just became addicted to that and my kids loved it as well. So it just became a thing like on the weekends I would just sit and sketch and use equation to get them to work. So I could show them on next Monday at school to get them excited. And all these patterns I was creating on the side were actually really beautiful. So I started posting them on social media on Instagram and just sharing them with people and they were voting and saying, ""Oh, we want this in a dress and we want this in pants."" I was like, ""Oh, wait. What are you saying that I should go back to the fashion thing? But yeah, that's kind of what started this whole thing."" So, Diara Blue, um, you do things really differently than other fashion companies and and part of that comes from your unique background both in math and having grown up in West Africa and Sagal and then also in um, in Norway, but part of it is also just, I think, a piece that is your values, right? Like you have this value of thinking about things that are built to last and future-mindedness. And one of the interesting parts about the brand to me is that you highlight in a way that many other people don't. How making something easy doesn't actually mean you're making it better. And I think often fashion is very easy but it's not better. Yeah. I think that in fashion we've kind of trained ourself for convenience like you know the fastest way you can get something um producing in mass creating so many sizes. for example, like you'll have a dress going from size 0 to 14 and it's numerical size is a new iteration and just creating so much like ease, but it's actually not easy at all. It's easy for the customer, but it's a very complicated system. It's very wasteful. I think it's a lazy system because it's a system that has existed and it's easy to plug into, but it's people don't really question it. And you know, why why are they four seasons a year? They do fall, winter, spring, summer. Like why why are they why do are they two seasons? Why are they four seasons? Why are they like everything is actually not a rule like you can change it and you can do it your own way. I think for me it's because I didn't come from this industry. I didn't even know what these rules were. One of my favorite quotes from Picasso is learn the rules like a pro so you can break them like an artist. But for me I'm like I don't even know the rules. So I break them all the time. So it's not even like I'm trying to be rebellious. I genuinely don't know. And I'm really embracing it now cuz I think in the beginning I had a little bit of imposter syndrome cuz like oh I didn't go to fashion school. I'm not based in New York. I don't have art background and then I started realizing it's a huge strength because I'm starting from a blank canvas and I'm challenging so many things and only after I started getting noticed by the press or the buyers I realized oh this is really special but there's a side of just like having values around waste and not not being wasteful and preserving things but also I think it's just being super naive from the start because I didn't really have a mold to follow. Uh and that ended up being my biggest strength because I I qu I I will question absolutely anything and sometimes people who are like you know heritage fashion brands or people who are from the industry will question it at first be like why not and I'm like yeah we should ask ourselves why not and not just in fashion but with any system why not. I think you have an incredible fashion brand, but I think also the approach that you take is a really important one regardless of the industry that we're in to to say like, well, what would it be like if we rethought this and why do we do it the way that we do? What if we did something that was better for you, for the environment, for the community rather than just the least frictionless thing? So, it's interesting to me to to have that conversation with you because you're currently based in Silicon Valley and I think you're in a part of the world that many of us associate I certainly strongly associate with um a place that is trying to remove as much friction as possible from life, right? Everything is like one click, it immediately arrives, things show up really fast and you're kind of not in that mindset at all. So, tell me about that being a rebel in the place that you're in. So, I went to Stanford um to get my masters in math education. And it's it's funny because coming from Wall Street, everybody who wanted to go to Stanford wanted to go to to the to the business school and like, you know, build a massive company and raise tons of capital and all of it. So, that's the first thing I did. I actually applied to business school because I wanted to just be able to show up on LinkedIn and feel cool. And when I got in, I realized actually I'm not doing this for the right reason because I'm going back to the word that I didn't want to be part of to begin with, which was this Wall Street fast-paced life. So, I turned it down at the last minute. And it created this massive crisis in my family like, ""Oh my god, you're so spoiled, blah, blah, blah."" It's like, ""No, it's not for me."" And a year later, I realized I wanted to be a teacher. So, I went to Stanford for teaching. And while I was there, I'm curious. So, I still went to the business school and took up a few classes. Same for the design school. And I remember in the business school there was a pitch competition where I was working on the blue at the time. It was not a company yet. And at the end of it, the professor was like really supportive cuz like you know I had one of the best results in the competition and it was really good. And he's like the next step is to go and raise a lot of capital and build this factory and and stuff. I was like I'm not doing that. And he was kind of disappointed. And I went like, ""No, I'm gonna go and be a math teacher and keep learning because the more I'm going to learn from the outside, the more I'm gonna I have my whole life to build this."" And I think that was so weird. It almost felt like I was wasting his time to be doing all this all of these classes to say, ""No, I'm not going to pursue it right away and raise a ton of money."" And I was like, the moment I raise money right away, it's going to be very easy for me to make mistakes cuz I'm not spending my money. Like I can waste somebody else's money and make these mistakes, but I really want to keep learning because I'm not trying to just build a fashion company. I'm trying to create change like structural change in an industry that I'm learning from the outside and that's not going to follow a blueprint. This blueprint of raising tons of money, starting a factory, producing inventory, stocking it somewhere like I'm not doing that. I went and pursued the teaching route but in my heart I knew I was going to pursue this eventually. So I'm teaching in the daytime and in the evening I'm using my equations to create prototypes and sending them on Instagram and every 24 hours I'm getting all these feedback literally like of what I should produce. So I learned how to design textiles the formal way. So I would create these patterns, show them and I'll actually get them printed in factories and I would buy all the textiles and send them to the to our factory in Sagal but not produce anything. So the opportunity for inventory was limitless but there was no cost. All I had was raw materials. Little did I know that business model was going to be what made my company successful. And I still haven't raised any funding and we're still cash flow positive 5 years later. It's because I don't have inventory. like a typical fashion brand spend a lot of cash flow and inventory. I can launch a collection today. If it flops, I literally don't lose anything. I'll be like, ""Okay, fine. Let's launch something new next week."" Like, and that whole model allowed me to, you know, get into massive partnerships with other retailers and create a very risk-free way of working with us because you're not, you know, it's it's all drop shipped. Like, you can uh order something on our website today and then you receive it in 7 days, but it actually gets made tomorrow. We operate like a restaurant. So, everything is modular. Well, the interesting part is that to me, one of the interesting parts of this is that it's not only a really effective business model for making it so that you're able to have this successful business, but it's also a business model that um creates a lot less waste. What we don't realize that waste is not just about the environment. And you know, when you're like, ""Oh, waste environment, you're so cute."" It's also financial. Like, if you think about it, you're wasting money. And the the industry is built into wasting money. like you're meant to overproduce to sell a certain percentage because the rest is going to go unmarked down or get lot sent to the trash or something. So it's built into the process. So you're basically making a business model in which you have a waste factor which is ridiculous to me. It's like why would you do that versus the the model we've built is super reactive. So when I think about a supply chain, we don't have a supply chain actually. We have a demand chain. So everything we do starts from the demand and as a result everything we produce we are not guessing anything like we produce what we produce today because it was demanded yesterday or last week. M so the the whole the whole like um operations work this way and the factory the one I started in the car and now we work with partner factories it's like a restaurant we buy all the raw materials based on what we see in the crowd sourcing that people like and we leave it there and every day like you go to a restaurant you can order chicken parmesan or you can get a Caesar you can get any assortment of it but the materials stay the same. The different with the restaurant is that our materials are not perishable they are not fabrics. There's always going to be waste from like scraps and cutting and stuff, but then we don't have the typical waste in this industry where um it's like one garbage truck full of clothes goes to a landfill every second. That's how this fashion industry works. We don't have to do deal with that both financially and environmentally because we are being responsive and community is also super important because in this whole process you have to build relationship with your customers. You're constantly asking them what they want to see. It's also humbling cuz as a designer I'm like, ""Oh, I have this I'm so smart. I have all these ideas. you put it out there and they're like, ""No, we hate it."" It's like, ""I'm really glad you're telling me right now before I spend all this money on it."" So, I know. Thank you. I'll do something else and I'll come back to you. It's It's very humbling and I really like that experience, too. Can you describe what the style of your clothes is or what they look like? Yeah, I would say in the beginning it was really much like I was I was stuck on Wall Street and I was daydreaming of being on a vacation. That's how this whole thing started like from dreams. So I would say most of the collection was very resort focused at first. Now it's full ready to wear but at first it was like cap tans and if you watch the white lotus what all those rich ladies are wearing in these hotels and are just super relaxed and everything is loose and flowy and you can eat everything you want and you just look great in in all of it and you just look rich and relaxed all the time. That that is the brand's aesthetic. Literally I think white lotus is the way to visualize it. Um, I come from a culture that's very colorful. So like prints are important. Everything is a print. I mean we have a few solid pieces, but even when it's solid, it has a bit of texture or something exciting to it. But Seneagalles people are not plain at all. We like color, we like prints, we like geometry, we like flowers. So like we have a lot of that. And I would say just clothes that make you feel beautiful and and happy. Like every time I see someone wearing our clothes or just I am wearing it, it just lifts my mood because it's such a beautiful energy behind it. It's all crowdsourced, so it has to be beautiful because people vote and we know what they want. They're really beautiful works of art, but also I think the the flexibility of them that they aren't just for one size and that they are designed to last for you is also something really, you know, sometimes you have like a a piece that you buy that would be like you're it's a really well-made, say, a sweater and you're going to keep this for years, but if your body changes, well, the sweater's probably not going to fit you as well. And I think you have a really interesting thing which is also very much embedded in senagle fashion which is that because they're flowing and because they are uh you know they're not tightly fitted they can accommodate different changes in your body and in different um if you need to be warmer or more covered or if you need to be looser and less covered that they're able to to adjust. I think there's something called emotional sustainability that we don't think about or like emotional durability. And it's like when you buy something and you get attached to it to wear it longer. And I think the more your clothes make you feel happy and good about yourself, the more that's going to happen. Like if you buy a set of jeans that are a size two and you get pregnant and they can't close anymore and the zipper breaks, the emotions around the jeans are really bad. Like you just feel bad about it's like the jeans just insulted you. But if you have a dress that no matter what your body does, it just embraces you. There's this emotional thing of like this is my friend. Like this dress is my friend and and there's love here and we we think about that when designing. When I'm designing things, I mean, we have our outfit models and everything. But I like to me and my mom try everything on and see how we live in it. Like there are clothes that I wear for like 6 months before actually putting them in the line just to see how I feel, how do they wash, what is it doing with my body, how it does in different climates. And there's this experience around how I want people to feel in the clothes is super important and how long we want you to be wearing them. And there's also a convertibility element. I would say a lot of our clothes are convertible or adjustable. Like you'd have a dress that has a like attached shawl into it, but the shawl can be removed. So you can just wear the shaw by itself or the dress by itself. We have these jumpsuits that are convertible to be pants or to be tied tied 19 different ways. Like that element is super important because you can wear it 10 times and each time it looks different versus wearing it once and be like, ""Okay, people have seen it. I cannot wear it anymore."" But every time it's going to be like, ""Oh, are you wearing a new dress?"" So you think about all of that from like a dur durability standpoint. Okay. So I I want to talk about um some of the philosophical philosophical parts of this. Um and I also want to talk about the Senagles parts of this. I personally have a connection to Sagal. I lived there and worked there and so Wait, what? This is how we should have started. I know. Well, I wanted to I wanted to start with you and then, you know, not make it about me, but um I I studied at uh University Shanta. And so Oh my god. Yeah, that's my hometown. Oh, really? You were from Dar originally? I'm from Dar. Yeah. Okay. Where in Dar Memos? Oh wow. That's like where I lived. I was in um Oh my god. Professor Yeah. That's literally Okay. That's like a five minute walk. That's why every day. Yeah. Oh, when was this? What year? It was um Let's see. It was 2008 and then I went back in 2010. Oh my god. Yeah. You were in my home literally probably pass in front of my house every day. Well, so I I wanted to ask you about a couple of things that are like that come to mind with me having spent time in Sagal. Like you said, there's this u very big part of culture is is you know having fun colors and making a statement with how you dress. for me as a person who like you know wasn't always a super confident person and also was like a you know a teenage boy and then a young adult man like a lot of the way that I would have said I related to fashion was trying to be invisible right like wearing something that's just like no one's going to comment on this and so it was f it was really interesting to then go to Sagal and like uh my senagles friend one day like as a present bought me like a big you know a big boo boo and I put that on and I walked down the street and people were like, ""Hey, looking good."" You know, like people were like giving me compliments and I was like, ""Oh, that's actually really fun."" I never experienced that piece before. And I feel like that spirit of like celebrating how you look and complimenting a stranger is so apparent in the clothes that you design. Like they're the kind of things where people are going to go, ""I love that. You look great."" You know, it's not quiet clothing. Not at all. We don't want to be quiet about anything. And that's the part of my culture that I wanted to bring. Um I have this group chat with my family. I would say 90% of the conversation are us complimenting each other. Like my dad would be going to a business meeting and you know he will take a selfie and dad selfie. Like he doesn't know the angles and everything but he will take a selfie and be like oh killing it with that crushing it since 1958. What a bad you are. Like everybody's going to add you have to add a comment and a compliment. And that's what all we do all day. It's in it's hilarious. It doesn't matter how sad you are. You open that group, there's like 50 messages every hour and it's just compliments, emojis, ridiculous laughter. And that's our culture. Like um if you have an event in Sagal, it's not about you, it's about the guests. You have a poet called the go, I'm sure you know, who's basically singing your praises. So you'll come in and be like, ""Hey Chris,"" and they'll make a poem about you and the boo boo. And he's going to have a rhyme for each verse, and they'll name you and praise you in front of everyone with a mic and drums. And you cannot if you cannot erase yourself. You have to be really much like you cannot be self- aacing in any way. So your outfits have to hit, you know, the way you carry yourself, your attitude, your smile, your energy. And I wanted to just put all of that into the the clothes we design. And like, you know, whenever I get feedback from customers or they tag us on Instagram, it's always, oh, we got so many compliments. I'm like, yep, that was the plan. That's the like really good part. I I also want to say a a piece that I noticed while I was in Sagal that I think is a is a darker side to the fashion industry in the United States and in Europe that I think is invisible to many people but is very visible when you're there which is that let's say you're just the regular consumer of clothes in the United States and you're done with a t-shirt or a dress or a pair of pants. You think that you're being responsible because what you do is you go and you give it to a charity that says they're going to reuse it, right? And and often those big pallets of of clothes then get shipped into other parts of the world like West Africa. And you know I'd be walking around in like rural Sagal and I'd see a kid wearing like I won the best clam bake in Rhode Island and it'd be like what? How did you get that shirt? But there's also this huge amount of textile waste that is just polluting the the water, polluting the land is just is just actually being shipped to a place that did not create the waste. Exactly. And I think that's the part that's so unfair because I think people don't see it's like oh charity I'm donating my clothes I'm being a better person but you're donating it to person who didn't ask for it and you're also killing the local economy where you donate it because these clothes coming in from the US from these charities they sell for close to nothing but then meanwhile you have local artisans there who are making good quality clothes from locally grown cotton handmade with heritage with all of the history but they have a hard time selling them because we being flooded with all these secondhand clothing that people here just are throwing in some container. I think it would be good for people from the western world to actually understand really the impacts of this because it does affect us significantly and a lot of those clothes are not wanted. I think people assume, oh, I'm sending it to the poor country and they they'll wear it. I'm sorry, we have style. The fashion level I've seen in Sagal and the scrappiness of people regardless of their social class is unmatched. So like that big sale Rhode Island t-shirt, if you send us a million of those, we don't want to wear them. You want to wear something beautiful. We want to wear something that fits, that looks good, that we chose. So that's something that I think it's worth talking about for sure. I think that in addition to the creative and artistic and personal story that's really interesting about your work is I also think there's quite an important and subtle political story here. The Zambian economist Damisao has a has a really powerful book and it's about how the western world has often undermined local economies and undermined local independence by you know so-called charity. So like if you send 10,000 tons of free rice to an area well that feeds the people who get the rice but then the local rice farmers are completely out of business and they can no longer produce rice because how could they compete with free rice? And that has very much happened in the fashion industry. And you are consciously employing these skilled crafts people who are in Sagal who are in many ways getting undermined by this weird reverse cycle of fast fashion. Absolutely. And I think even culturally there's also the erasure of of of fashion by doing that because you're sending like you said with the rice manu the rice farmers, right? You cannot compete with free rice. you cannot compete with these um donated clothes that are I mean they're still going to get sold but at very low prices. So like local artisans do suffer and you erasing them in their skills because it's like you know how am I going to sell something that I took hours to make in good quality versus something that just came in from Rhode Island that's like a few cents. The donation of of of a shirt from a charity standpoint, it makes you feel good. You just went to Goodwill or wherever I dropped something and you're like, ""Oh, I did a good act. I donated my shirt."" But what about you do something that's more sustainable and you actually empower and support those industries or those people in a way that they can continue to self sustain. You know, it also goes to an idea and a and a phrase that I learned while I was in Sagal, a wool phrase that I thought was very um powerful and I think about a lot which is like together we're strong, right? Like the the union creates the strength is the strong the strength. That's not something I often think about when I'm buying clothes that even the purchase of clothes can be a way of demonstrating that care for each other and that that virtue of um community-mindedness. We are all connected. I mean, yeah, we can have boundaries between us and countries and languages, but at the end of the day, we are one people. I mean, that's how I think about the world. And if you think about yourself not as this tiny little arm in the system, but like you are the system. Every choice you make impacts the system. And when you think about your purchases, not just for clothes, but I think it can become almost second nature like how is all these decisions affecting the overall system. I think you're adding to it or you're taking away from it. Just having that mindset will help, I think, make a lot of better decisions in general, especially with purchasing and sustainability as a whole. Someone who is thinking about um wants to think about their clothes or their fashion differently, what advice would you have for them? What are maybe three things that they should think about differently when they go about um looking in their closets or or purchasing new clothes? I would say I think it's important to have a capsule wardrobe. And what I call a capsule wardrobe is like your essential basics that you could wear all the time. Like for me is like a black pair of jeans, black pants, a plain white or black shirt, things that are just timeless and then have your like, you know, dramatic add-ons that really make the statement. Like I will always wear all black with a dramatic Diar blue kimono on it or a dramatic jacket or a denim jacket like there has all these accessories. So I would say you I'm sure everybody looking in their closets and saying oh I have nothing to wear. You can always find some capsule pieces there that are timeless and focus on those and then make that decor and then see what you can add to it. I also think shopping we should think about shopping in a way of buying things that are complimentary. So I think with online shopping it's so easy to just want everything and I shouldn't be saying this cuz I run a fashion brand. and I want you to buy everything. But also sometime you send a newsletter telling you don't buy anything. You use what you have and here's how to wear it differently. So like how can you get you know these colorful beautiful pens you bought last year? How can you bring them back to life this year but with another way of styling it where it looks completely different? How do you make your purchases complimentary where and I think about this a lot with our collections as well like how can you buy five things but you know a mix of sets and dresses and whatnot but for those five things actually create 10 to 15 outfits because you know permutations commutation that's the math in me and then the third one is just kind of be mindful about every thing you're doing with your wallet you're voting for something righ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 so everything you purchase always ask yourself what am I voting for here like I'm voting with my dollars for something yeah it could be beautiful style, but what is the tag inside saying? Like for me, buying something a dress for $8 on some fast fashion website, you're voting for exploitation. You're voting for waste. Like there's no way somebody can produce a dress for $8 with the right fabric and be paid the right wages. If that happens, it's because somebody has been exploited in the supply chain and you are voting for that, right? So like just ask yourself those questions. And I think it's just common sense. Like do these numbers actually make sense? like," """"Oh yeah"," I just did a shopping haul with $50 and I got 20 dresses."""" Like", how how does that even make any sense logically? And like, what had to happen for these dresses to get to you? I think those are difficult questions and conversations to have with yourself, but I think they are important. Another thing that I think is really interesting about you and your work is in some ways you are supporting these uh very old-fashioned traditional ways of making things, having a skilled artisan making something on demand rather than creating a ton. But in other ways, you are very much using your your background in in math and in technology and you're you're using these very new technologies as well, right? Like there's artificial intelligence is involved in your work. So can you talk about the blend between old and new and how you think about that in from a values perspective I'm actually really interested in too. Right. often times the moment you drop words like AI and tech and what it's the antithesis of artisan craftsmanship like it's just two words that don't talk to each other like technology is just a tool it doesn't matter like it's just like you're using a typewriter before and now you have a printer but ultimately what matters is the quality of the letter you're writing if you're writing a love letter it doesn't matter if you write on a typewriter on a printer on a printer you can make more of them and send them out faster and maybe meet your love faster but the letter content has to be good you have to have passion in your love letter you have to write it Well, you have to have skill. You have to understand language. So that was the kind of example I like to give. And I think in fashion for me, technology is what allows me to actually humanize this whole thing because think about it. If an artisan takes forever to make a dress manually because you don't have an industrial factory, it's all like work. I call it a workshop, right? And if they're going to take all this time doing all this work, it better be the right work. I don't want to guess. I want to give them exactly what they need to produce. And to do that, technology helps me crowdsource really fast. I could use AI or math or whatever to create these prints or like these ideas of the prints and the tones and the things I want to put out there. I can put them on digital avatars within 24 hours. I know what to do. And that's the part that for me that is super strong because technology allows me to test and learn and figure out what is right fast and then the production and all of that can take its time and be done right versus if I didn't have technology and I still wanted to do this artisal way of things. Now I'm subjecting them to all this work with a lot of waste because they'll be producing all these things that nobody likes and then what do we do with it? Right? So that's kind of how I blend the two words and I think they can be very complimentary if we use the right way. I don't see a word where I'm going to be like you know 3D printing dresses and all of that. Like it's just I want human hands touching the products. So as long as the tech is more from a data information accuracy like I want to know I'm wrong faster than everyone else basically. I think with you there's this really interesting piece which is right now there are these incredibly powerful new technologies that are being developed but they are often being developed by and for I would say not just by but for people with one very specific background right like wealthy white men who went to one of 20 different colleges in the United States or maybe a few in in Europe and and so I think the idea of like what happens when a powerful technology then gets used by someone who can bring a completely different perspective, right? Like you have this history of understanding how fashion works in Sagal of understanding the what it looks like on the ground and how could technology change that. Yeah. And I think this is something that honestly I learned in the classroom. It was like how having a different perspective can really shift things. Same for fashion. Technology for me was I'm working all the time. I don't have time to make all these drawings and create all these textiles and then have them made and pay all this money and create all these waste. How can I use technology to get to my answer quicker and still make people feel comm community? Like technology allows me to do that. That's good technology. That's like humanizing the whole experience. Back then like rendering images took forever and it was just super super slow. But it was all generative stuff that was faster than sitting down and and taking 3 days to draw one textile versus being able to create 100 iterations in one day and get answers. Like technology often time is thought about in terms of efficiency and saving money and making money and all of it. But for me it was honestly about how do I technology to not waste my time and to not waste resources and people's time. Uh and naturally saving money and making money comes with it because you're saving resources and optimizing. So some of my my discomfort with AI is often that it seems like it's built where at its core it is taking human work and then devaluing it, right? like it is like anonymously built on all this work that people put their blood, sweat, and tears into and then it says like actually I'm the genius machine and because of that and it kind of makes a lot of people's work invisible. Are we buying into a framework that says these few powerful people can take the work of less powerful people and that that's something that is okay to build the future on. And I don't know the answer, but I'm curious what your perspective is. And I and I agree with you. I think when I first started seeing like these AI art models in the very beginning, I don't know if you remember, it would take a picture and tell you the Picasso version of it and then the Monet version of it. And it was just so lame to be honest. And I remember talking to a museum here that I was working with and they mentioned that what they hate about AI art is that a lot of art is about history and sources and citing. Like you put a work and then you have to site the references, you have to site the inspiration, the history and AI kind of erases all of that and just create derivative stuff. Yeah. The way I use it in particular is that I don't know, let's say I want to do something about a flower garden as a print. I can easily sketch a flower garden in like 30 seconds with doodles and it's going to be hideous, but then I can plug that into AI and say take my sketch and add green and and purple and make the flowers fill up the screen and blah blah blah. So, in in a way, it's kind of based on my work or like on old prints I've designed and things. And I think my work has a very clear signature when you look at it where you can see it's consistent. But I think with all these technologies you have to be it goes back to intention right you have to be really mindful and you have to be very clear in like what is the message that you're trying to give like the message I'm trying to give is hey I want to develop and work on things but before I put so much effort into it I want to know if you like it for me it's a prototyping tool that's that's the angle with the AI and the generative stuff or math or anything that's like technologydriven is really like prototyping and testing and then understanding what do I want going want to put human sweat and tears into that tracks for me. And I I also think that look, it would be relatively easy for someone to set up a shop that's called like Mara Blue, you know, one word, one very not and then and then they could use AI and copy a lot of your stuff. And even if the the fashion looked very similar," I think that that fashion would be worth less because I think that your story and the care and the thought and the philosophy behind it. I think that that actually imbuss the physical objects with value in a way that someone's copy would not. I really believe that and I believe that about a lot of people's work as artists. Yeah. And I believe it too. I think that's what makes art like what makes something stand in a museum be worth so much and the the print copy on the street is not is because people feel that energy. I think authenticity is is value and it's something you cannot explain but you can feel and I think that's what with art I love this quote that's saying art wasn't supposed to look nice it was supposed to make you feel something you can't explain it and I think when something is done authentically with the right intention and the right way you'll just feel it cuz yeah in this world of AI it's got a lot easier to copy people and replicate but you cannot replicate authenticity dear Vuso thank you so much for being on the show it was such a pleasure thank you thank you so much for having me was Fun.""",unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ki5AcnSWbSs,"When you see the ideal climate movement,
what do you imagine? When I imagine the ideal climate movement,
I see a house of many rooms. Each one of us can have a room
inside that house, and while each of the rooms
can be a different shape and size, all the rooms are essential
to making up the overall edifice of the house of the movement. This is how I've been thinking
about the climate movement ever since I joined the United Nations
in the lead up to the Paris Agreement. My boss, Christiana Figueres, used to describe the Paris Agreement
as like a house of many rooms. The governments,
the businesses, civil society, they all had a room in the Paris house. That's what made Paris
succeed in the moment. But recently, it's like our movement
has started to live in separate houses. And this is leading to a fragmentation
when we can afford it least. Remember 2019, when four million people
took to the streets across 4,000 cities to march on climate in a single day? Last year, the figure was 70,000. We are forgetting our own potential
for mass collective action on climate. I think we need to rebuild
the house of many rooms. But what kind of a house
do we actually need to truly take on the climate crisis? Well, we're going to need
a much bigger house. We're going to need a house
that builds trust, and we're going to need a house
that actually brings inside the artist to inspire us,
to spice things up a little bit. So when I imagine this house, I like to imagine
a vast 100-room structure, like the Alhambra Palace in Spain, where different beliefs clashed
and cooperated throughout the ages. Because actually, the primary challenge our movement faces is in allowing different beliefs,
different mindsets, to coexist under the same roof. We've got the realists, and the realists say
we are rapidly hurtling towards negative planetary tipping points, with every year hotter than the last, with rising sea surface temperatures making the hurricanes
we're experiencing right now twice as likely, and with a crazy surge
in oil and gas exploration that is leading to another
12 billion tons of emissions. But then there's the optimists. And they say, hang on a second. We're actually hurtling
towards positive climate tipping points. In energy, we added 50 percent more
renewables capacity last year than the year before. In electric vehicles, one in five
car sales was electric last year. Four years ago, it was one in 25. In batteries, sales are doubling
every two to three years, which is wiping out
half of fossil fuel demand. The realists and the optimists
are obviously both correct. It’s when we start embracing and housing
both of them simultaneously that we root ourselves in the reality,
the realism of where we’re at but leave ourselves defiantly optimistic
in our ability to unleash change. We start being able to take head on
oil and gas’s attempt to gaslight us, what I call oil-and-gaslighting. We start renewing our agency to act. So I saw this happen at the UN
climate negotiations in Dubai. By this time I've left the UN. I'm climate campaigning. And in Dubai, the world
expected governments to signal the end of the fossil fuel era. But as we got into the second week,
the outlook was not looking great. We decided to convene a group
of realist scientists, optimistic businesses and activists in a movement that wasn't
ready to give up. We did media, advertisements,
social content. We sent countless emails,
made a lot of phone calls. We ended up crafting a letter
to the president of the negotiations, clamoring for a phase out on fossil fuels, which in under 48 hours got 800, then 1,000, then 2,000 signatures. And as all of this was happening, I was called into a private office
only to find the COP president himself. And he said, ""Hello, Matthew,
I know what you're doing."" And I thought, ""Shit.
He knows what I'm doing. I am in such trouble."" But he said, ""I know what you
and your partners are doing, and I want you to know we support it."" And I realized that when you start
creating the places, the spaces where everyone
can participate without finger-pointing, you start to connect and collaborate
on an entirely new dimension. After that, we were getting
spoken about by the negotiators. They would text us and say,
""Hey, please keep the pressure up."" When the hammer finally came down
on the last day of the negotiations, governments agreed
to transition away from fossil fuels. Not perfect, sure, but the first time
fossil fuels had ever been mentioned in a UN climate text. And while we knew our effort was only ever
a small part of the overall success, we also felt like we were tapping
into this collective energy that was greater than the sum
of the individual parts. But before I get completely carried away, this house that we're building
for our climate movement obviously needs to stretch way beyond
these formal climate negotiations. There have been
nearly 30 of them, after all. And it needs to be a house
where we build trust, where those inside it are honest. And we particularly need trust
from those big organizations that make up the global economy. So before Dubai, I helped to create
the world's largest climate coalition in a campaign called Race to Zero. It’s got 15,000 organizations now,
covering two-thirds of the global economy, and they've all set their sights
on halving emissions by 2030 and getting to zero by 2050. And that's promising. But simply having a bigger house
is not enough on its own. Some of these organizations
are struggling to meet that goal. Some of them are pulling back, going quiet or being unable
to ask for help. And this is leading
to a breakdown in trust, which threatens to pull our movement
down from the inside. If we don't have trust, if we don't have truth, our movement is nothing. And I would say
exactly the same about art. Without art, we're nothing. So I want to return to that image
of the Alhambra up on the hill. Because the Alhambra is all about the art. Its design owes as much to poets
and philosophers as it does architects. And like the Alhambra, our movement
needs to bring inside the artists. Artists have inspired paradigm shifts
on issues like race and sexuality. Think of David Hockney painting
queer life when it was still illegal. Or Billie Holiday singing a song
like ""Strange Fruit"" a quarter of a century
before the US Civil Rights Act. Or less profoundly, just think of Harry Styles
getting photographed on an electric bike. Viral. The point is, artists have the power
to awaken the public consciousness for mass climate action. That's how we build
the climate movement of the future. A house of many rooms where each one of you
is welcome to have a room inside, the realists and the optimists among you. Where we build trust with one another, including on the laws we need
to meet our goals. And where we also start inviting inside the artists to inspire us all
in a movement of possibility for the best house party of all time. The thing is, we know
that four in five of us, globally, all want climate action. We're already the 80 percent. We just don't know we know it yet. Thank you so much.

eZ1PdfBPyL0,"Come with me, back in time. The date is April 15, 2019. That was six years ago. We are a few days before Easter, on a late spring afternoon. We are in Paris on Île de la Cité. Notre-Dame Cathedral
has been there for over eight centuries. The day is winding down,
and people are heading home from work. Nobody notices the smoke rising
from the spire of the cathedral. The time is around 6:30pm. Now the smoke has become more noticeable, and people look up in disbelief. They watch the flames burning
through the melting lead roof. Night is falling, and the flames illuminate the cathedral. Now the huge plume
of smoke fills the street. There is an acrid smell in the air. Some people start praying,
others start chanting. Firefighters are now fighting
a relentless battle. And then the spire collapsed
into an inferno with a terrible crash. President Macron rushed on the scene. He changed his agenda
for this momentous event. Notre-Dame was more
important than politics. Not knowing the full extent of the damage, President Macron decided that the cathedral
would be rebuilt in five years. Hmph. (Laughter) Donations came in from all sides, ranging from small to huge amounts. They reached the incredible
total of 846 million Euro. Why so much generosity? Well, ever since Victor Hugo
published his novel ""Notre-Dame de Paris"" in 1831, the cathedral has moved the entire world. That was almost 200 years ago. Then the cathedral went
from print to screen to stage. The silent film ""Esmeralda""
came out in 1905, followed by many more famous films. Disney made a cartoon
character, Quasimodo. Musicals were made about Notre-Dame. Today, Notre-Dame appears
in many games and shows, people in every country
are touched by Notre-Dame. Incredibly, we may
never have known Notre-Dame. Since it was built in 1163, it has been the Cathedral of records. It has the highest vaults ever built, gigantic rose windows and a huge flying buttress. When completed, it was the tallest building
in the Christian world. But after being a showcase
of human genius, Notre-Dame fell out of favor. It fell out of fashion, cost too much, was vandalized
by the French Revolution and became the “Temple of Reason.” Napoleon was crowned
emperor there in 1804, but the building was in a very bad shape. Then, the cathedral
was considered for demolition. This is when Victor Hugo published
his novel ""Notre-Dame de Paris."" It put the cathedral
at the heart of France. It put its architecture
at the heart of its culture. So it was decided that the building
would be restored. The architect Viollet-le-Duc, my father, won the competition
to restore Notre-Dame. He turned it into
the building we know today. His “Œuvre Total,” full-scale work, was to create the ideal cathedral imagined by the 19th century. Notre-Dame continued its course. It came out intact of World War I
and World War II. It had funerals for presidents
and national tributes. There was a ceremony after the deadly
terrorist attacks of 2015. Then came the fateful day, April 15, 2019. The following day, I entered the cathedral in ruins. The light was harsh. The stone was a dark brown, water was streaming down from the vaults, the floor was covered with burned wood. The chairs were scattered
by the collapsing vaults. The altar was crushed. But the large golden cross
was in the background. The statue of the Virgin of the Pillar, Notre-Dame de Paris, seemed untouched. Through a hole in the vault, molten lead had flowed
into the hand of the Christ of the Pieta. That evening I found the rooster that had crashed
on the section of the roof. It escaped destruction. It had miraculously come off its axis when the spire collapsed. At that moment, I felt a determination
that removed all doubt. It gave me a power and strength
I didn't know I had. I always loved Notre-Dame. I visited for the first time at age seven. I loved the symphony of stone and the harmony of light. For me, architecture and music
became one that day. When I was 16, I saw an exhibition
of the architect Viollet-le-Duc. From that day I wanted
to become chief architect of Historical Monuments Society. And why not, one day become
the architect of Notre-Dame? The dream came true in 2013. But six years later,
in 2019, it became a nightmare. On that evening, on April 15, I made up my mind to fight for Notre-Dame. First secure the site, then supervise the reconstruction
with a team of architects. The entire world was watching us. All were anxious to see
the cathedral restored. We could not fail
in the project of the century, “le chantier du siècle.” There was a spirit in the air, L’esprit Notre-Dame. It was a unique mix of focus and joy,
companionship and sharing. We were all working to save
the cathedral, and we were proud to be part of this fantastic journey. I gained admiration and respect
for these specialized tradespeople. This created a bond that united all. Two thousand people were busying
themselves on this site. We had to invent, design and implement ways
to stabilize the building. Master carpenters,
glass workers, scaffolders, masons and rope access technicians
worked together well. The gables, pillars and high bays
had to be shored up quickly. We had to prop up the 28 flying buttresses and cover the vaults with tarps. We had to put nets in the nave, and the high vaults
had to be shored up too. We had to sort through the rubble. A cathedral made of steel
was built inside the stone cathedral. The building was adorned with scaffolding. The most dangerous part was dismantling
the melted scaffolding in the transept. The scaffolding was there
for restoration work before the fire. The scaffolders and the rope technicians made their way through the twisted metal. They had to dismantle the steel monster that could collapse. After days and nights
of hard and dangerous work, they succeeded. Once the cathedral was stabilized, the work to rebuild it
could finally start. The journeymen followed
in the footsteps of the builders of the Middle Ages. They had the same spirit,
the same dexterity and the same materials. The stained glass windows
and the decorations became lively again. The walls and the vaults started to show
the clear golden hue of the stone again. Then an army of carpenters works
on the new framework. They used the same materials,
the same tools and the same gestures of old. The spire was erect again, and a new golden rooster
was placed on top of it to protect the cathedral. The inside of the cathedral was like
it had been under Viollet-le-Duc: bright and soft yellow. The stained glass windows
and the chapel were vivid again, the chandeliers were shining again, the sculpture had pride to place again. We had to brave a COVID pandemic, deal with pollution by lead, face bad weather, including heatwaves, working under very trying conditions. Why, with all of this, the tradespeople, journeymen and architects worked
with patience and expertise. Within the five years’ deadline,
they gave Notre-Dame back to Paris, to France and to the world. (Cheers and applause) May the rebirth of Notre-Dame be an example of what human beings are capable of. (Music) Merci beaucoup. Thank you. (Cheers and applause)",unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cjG0m9QUF34,"Manoush Zomorodi: OK, so I have
been following Jasmine's career. She gave a TED Talk at TEDWomen
five years ago -- Jasmine Crowe-Houston:
Five years ago in December. MZ: Which is crazy. And I interviewed you three years ago,
and now here you are. And so much has happened. JCH: Yes. MZ: You are more of
a behind-the-scenes person. For people who don't know Goodr, explain your story, how you came
to be so aware of food waste and what you are doing about it. JCH: Hi, everyone. I'm so excited to be back at TED. This is like, we have a relationship here. I mean, TEDx, TEDWomen,
TED Radio, TEDNext. I mean, I'm going to name my next kid Ted. (Laughter) But, you know, I started
Goodr here in Atlanta. I had created a homeless -- I would say, for people experiencing
homelessness, a pop-up restaurant. And the concept really came to me after feeding and working
with a volunteer group and making all these
peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, going out to the streets
and handing them out, and a man telling me,
""Oh, I'm allergic to nuts."" And I thought, we just made 1,000
peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, and nuts are one
of the number one allergies. And it made me think that dignity was lost in how we are serving our unhoused, in how we're serving people in need. And that too often we think, well, they're homeless or they're hungry, take this and be happy, forgetting the fact that they
could have religious convictions, dietary restrictions,
or they could plain out be allergic. And so I created this pop-up restaurant
where I would rent tables and chairs and linens and print out menus and let people feel like
they were dining at a restaurant. And a video went viral,
and it was a 15-second clip. I'll never forget it, because it was
before Instagram allowed you to have, you know, minute-videos, longer videos. So I woke up one morning
really afraid because I had never, I mean obviously gone viral. And I was like,
what's going on on Facebook? I need to get off this app. It was like one of those things. And so I'm reading through millions
of views and comments, and what people kept asking me
was: Who donated the food? And the truth was, nobody,
I was couponing, price-matching. I would start cooking on Friday, Saturday, go out and feed about 300-500
people every Sunday. And so I was like, I need
to get this food donated. I went to Google, fully expecting
to get a list of all the businesses that are going to donate food to me to help me keep feeding people. And I would, you know,
live happily ever after. And instead I found about food waste. And I read an 86-page report
by the Harvard Food Law Policy Group. And as I'm reading through this, at this point now into
the wee hours of the morning, I'm getting upset because I'm thinking about the people
that are lined up at 9am for my 3pm feeding every Sunday, because they know
that there's not a lot of people that come out to feed during the week. They were living at the former
Metro Atlanta Peach Tree Homeless Task Force. It was the only shelter in the city
that would allow families to come. And that's so important. A lot of you all don't know,
but if you are a homeless mother, you have a 15-year-old son, you guys have got to go
to two different shelters. And so I was feeding all these people. I learned about food waste,
and I became upset. And I was like, I'm going to solve this. I'm going to do something, to your point, better and “Goodr.” And that's what got me started. MZ: So explain what Goodr does now, because from going
to peanut butter sandwiches, it's impressive. JCH: So now we have
a two-sided business model as it relates to food waste. We can help a business keep all
of their food out of landfill. If it's edible, we're getting it
to people in need that are people like me feeding people: shelters, safe houses,
domestic violence centers, churches. One of our largest partners
is communities and schools. We feed thousands of kids every week. So we keep edible food
from going to landfill, and we are delivering it
directly to people in need while giving all of our clients
back a lot of data: how many pounds they're keeping
out of the landfill, what does this mean for their CO2
emissions and their carbon footprint. And then we have a hunger side
of our business, which was birthed during the pandemic, that really focuses on creating
sustainable solutions to solve hunger. We build free grocery stores
inside of schools. We have 28 right now around the country. We have grocery and meal delivery. During the height of the pandemic, Goodr delivered all the meals
to Atlanta Public School students that got free breakfast and lunch
but were learning virtually. So we made sure
that they got food at home. So we really are solving
hunger and food waste. MZ: So can you just explain -- Can we give her -- (Applause) Part of me is like, 40 percent, that's such a crazy statistic. JCH: It's a crazy number. MZ: Why, when you talk to the companies, nonprofits, like, what is happening
that there is so much food available, but going nowhere? JCH: It's a startling number. If food waste itself was a country, it would be the third-largest
country in the world. So it's a lot of food. So you think about that. Between the production,
the transportation and the disposal nearly two percent of all US GDP we spend on food that,
you know, we never even eat. And I think what it is is that the old guard is, we've always
done it this way. We've always thrown it away,
and this is how we do it. And of course, when I was first starting,
people were like, oh, well, if someone gets sick and we'll get sued. And so Goodr said, hey,
we'll take on all of that onus. We provide the packaging materials,
we provide the labels. When nonprofits receive the food,
it comes from Goodr, they sign hold harmless agreements. I have a multi-million-dollar
liability insurance because the airport was my first customer,
and we were driving on tarmacs, and I ended up having to get insurance
that I wasn't quite ready for. But it definitely helped the business. And even with all of that,
people will still say, ""Well, we're just afraid."" Or, “Our lawyers just
can’t wrap their heads around it.” Or you know, “We’re going to compost
everything, even if it’s edible.” Which I’m still happier
that it’s not going into landfill if it gets composted. You know, of course, Goodr,
we deliver to hog farms, we have anaerobic digesters
we'll take food to. So we want to keep it out of landfill. But feeding hungry people
is not a priority for too many people in this country. And that's a problem. (Applause) MZ: Tomorrow, I am coming
to see one of your facilities. JCH: I'm so excited about that,
you're going to love it. MZ: From what I understand,
it's bread day, so bread is going to be coming
in from all different places, and then you are going to be sorting it. Some of it goes, as you said, to compost, if it's not for human consumption. JCH: Or to a hog farm. MZ: Or to a hog farm, which is amazing. JCH: Or a cattle farm, I think
we have cattle farms now. MZ: Yes you do, I've seen that. And then some will go,
of course, to people, to schools, to hospitals or wherever else. But talk to me more
from the corporate side. How did you get people
to come on board with this? Did something have to change
when it comes to laws and forcing companies to do this? Is it because they want to be able
to say to their customers like, we are a sustainable company. JCH: So what I used to do
is I would go to the websites of the big hotel groups,
the big food groups, and I would look
at their sustainability reports. This is how I got the airport
as a customer. And I went to them and I said, “Hey, I’m looking at your waste tonnage, and 27 percent of this,
according to the EPA, is food. So you guys wasted 25 million meals."" Now I have no idea if that was true, but I looked at their
sustainability report. I used the EPA's calculation that food was the number one
thing in landfill, and I was able to go back
to the Atlanta airport and say, ""Listen, you guys
are sitting in College Park, the children in this city
are living in poverty, and all this food is going to waste. And this doesn't make any sense."" And so the airport became one
of our first large-scale customers. And you think of all
of the grab-and-go food items that goes to waste every single night
if it's not for Goodr. And now that's why I need
to be in more airports. But getting that before it goes to waste and getting it to Gateway Center
before Georgia workforce, their third shift is coming out
and building half of this city. A lot of men that are trying
to transition out of homelessness, them getting that meal, putting this food in our grocery stores and families taking it home for free. This is what it does. So I think it was really about making
people keep their promises. You know, like, hey, I won't say the hotel group,
but they had on their website and this is someone
I'm trying to pitch now, and I was like, you guys said you're going
to cut food waste in half by 2025. This is in two months. Why have you guys not started? What’s the process? So a lot of times it's trying
to hold their foot to the fire. MZ: Can we clone Jasmine? I want her holding all these
companies accountable. (Applause) JCH: It’s about keeping -- I think we live for the announcement
and we as people don't follow up. On the delivery, right? Because for someone
to invest millions, I mean, I don't even know how much
a Super Bowl commercial costs, but I've heard it's like
a million dollars per 30 seconds. I could be wrong. But to invest two to three million dollars and not follow up on your promise? MZ: That's called greenwashing. JCH: Yes, and that's a lot of that. MZ: So you're not just
in Atlanta, though now. You've grown a lot. JCH: Yes, so we are
in 15 states, 26 markets. So this is where we have food
moving and being donated. And then we have grocery stores
in about five states, maybe six or seven now. But we are doing our food waste
business obviously in more locations. MZ: Someone was asking me, they're like, but how do
these companies keep track? Because it must be so random
what they can get rid of. And I said, well, actually,
there's an app for that. Which, when I first heard about your app, I was like, that seems weird, but actually it is really the linchpin
in making this new system work. JCH: It's a logistics issue,
that's really what I saw. So when and shout out to Jackie Chu,
she runs TEDxAtlanta, and she convinced me
to do my first TEDx Talk. And when I was talking to her
about it, she was like, ""Oh, I get it, it's a logistics problem."" And I was like, you get it. And that's really what it is. Hunger is not an issue of scarcity. And we hear about that, right? We need to produce more food,
we need to grow more food We are wasting 40 percent of it. It's really about logistics. How do we connect this excess food
with the millions of people that need it? Seniors, their income doesn't change. We're going to be seniors, all of us. Some of us probably already are. But all of us, God willing. And once you get to that point, it doesn't matter then
if toilet paper goes up, if bread or eggs are more expensive. This is all you have to work with. So it's really about how
quickly can we match it. So we inventory everything
it is that they sell. We create a very easy user experience
where they click on the items, tell us how many, request the pick-up. We leverage the shared economy
that's already out there, and that's how we've been able
to grow to a lot of different locations. We don't have to hire our own drivers or purchase trucks and vehicles. Now we do have a couple, but what we leverage is a driver
that's already out there. And drivers love it. They're like, ""Oh my God,
I'm feeding people, I'm getting paid to do it."" And they make it happen. MZ: So, literally, like, the person, let's say I'm working
at a big company and I work, you know, in the cafeteria area, I take out my phone, and what do I do? JCH: Or it could go on
your point of sale system and you click on the Goodr app, your menu is already there, and you're just clicking
on the items that you have, saying, I’ve got 10 chicken
breasts, I’ve got this. Our platform is calculating
the approximate weight of those items. So we pull a lot of that data
from US Foods, Sysco, whoever they're ordering their food from, and then it's calculating
the tax value of those items at the time of donation, which is a critical offering
to our clients. And once that food gets picked up,
a nonprofit receives it. They sign for it like
they would a UPS package, and a donation letter
with a picture of that donation from that nonprofit automatically goes to our client's portal. So now they see everything
that they've donated, the nonprofit it went to, and a tax deduction receipt
for what they donated. (Applause) MZ: And the carbon that they've saved? JCH: Yeah, we have a corporate social
responsibility impact report as well as a sustainability. And actually, I remember
one of my angel investors, she sits on the board of IHG,
who’s one of Goodr’s customers, and she messaged me last year
at their board meeting in London. And she was like,
""Goodr is on the board report."" They’re literally talking
about how we’re cutting food waste with this company. MZ: So they're starting
to show off by using you. JCH: As they should. (Laughter) It's such a good thing, yeah. MZ: Growth. I mean, we should be clear, you're not a nonprofit. You are a B Corp. Why is that important to you? Why did you decide to go
for a for-profit company? Is it because that is something
that you hope to scale? Where are the pros and cons with that? JCH: There was a couple things. One, I think the nonprofit was going to be
a much harder old guard to get past because everybody always donates
to the food bank. It's all we ever know, we've been doing
canned food drives since we were eight. Our kids are still doing it in school now, and I felt like I was going to be
spending a lot of time trying to gain respect
in the nonprofit space. The biggest piece that I saw, though, was that businesses were already
paying to throw this food away. So this was not newfound spin. They're already paying
Waste Management, Republic Services, whoever their waste company is. Mind you, the waste industry
is a trillion-dollar industry. None of us ever say,
let's just keep our trash. We were like, is trash day missing? Oh my God, it's a hurricane,
they didn't run today. We are paying for this on a daily basis. So when I realized that, I realized that this was not going to be
newfound spin for these businesses. It was going to be a better spin. So dollar for dollar,
we're a little bit more expensive. But the outcome, the return
on the investment for our clients is far much greater
than they would ever get from a traditional waste company. And so I do look at us
as a triple bottom line, we're for people, we're for planet
and we are for profit. (Applause and cheers)",unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
q5_PrTvNypY,"You are a senior military officer and you've just received a chilling
message on social media. Four of your soldiers have been taken, and if demands are not met
in the next ten minutes, they will be executed. All you have to go on
is this grainy photo, and you don't have the time to figure out if four of your soldiers
are, in fact, missing. What's your first move? If I may be so bold, your first move is to contact
somebody like me and my team. I am by training an applied mathematician
and computer scientist. And I know that seems like a very
strange first call at a moment like this, but I have spent the last 30 years
developing technologies to analyze and authenticate
digital images and digital videos. Along the way, we've worked with journalists,
with courts and with governments on a range of cases from a damning photo of a cheating spouse, gut-wrenching images of child abuse, photographic evidence
in a capital murder case, and of course, things
that we just can't talk about. It used to be a case would come
across my desk once a month. And then it was once a week. Now, it's almost every day. And the reason for this escalation
is a combination of things. One, generative AI. We now have the ability to create images that are almost
indistinguishable from reality. Two, social media dominates the world and is largely unregulated and actively promotes
and amplifies lies and conspiracies over the truth. And collectively, this means
that it is becoming harder and harder to believe anything
that we read, see or hear online. I contend that we are
in a global war for truth with profound consequences
for individuals, for institutions, for societies,
and for democracies. And I'd like to spend
a little time talking today about what my team and I are doing to try to return some of that trust
to our online world and in turn, our offline world. For 200 years, it seemed reasonable
to trust photographs. But even in the mid 1800s, it turns out the Victorians
had a sense of humor. They manipulated images. Or you could alter history. If you fell out of favor
with Stalin, for example, you may be airbrushed
out of the history books. But then, in the turn of the millennium, with the rise of digital cameras and photo-editing software, it became easier and easier
to manipulate reality. And now, with generative AI, anybody can create any image
of anything, anywhere, at a touch of a button. From four soldiers tied up in a basement to a giraffe, trying
on a turtleneck sweater. (Laughter) It's not fun and games, of course, because generative AI is being used
to supercharge past threats and create entirely new ones. The creation of nudes
of real women and children used to humiliate or extort them. Fake videos of doctors promoting
bogus cures for serious illnesses. A Fortune 500 company losing
tens of millions of dollars because an AI impersonator
of their CEO infiltrated a video call. Those threats are real, they are here, and we are all vulnerable. Before we talk about how
we would analyze this image to determine if it's real or not, it's useful to understand
how generative AI works. Starting with billions of images
with a descriptive caption like this, each image is degraded until
nothing but visual noise is left. A random array of pixels. And then the AI model learns
how to reverse that process by essentially turning that noise back into the original image. And when this process is done,
not once, not twice, but billions of times
on a diverse set of images, the machine has learned
how to convert noise into an image that is semantically
consistent with anything you type. And it's incredible. But it is decidedly not
how a natural photograph is taken, which is the result of converting
light that strikes an electronic sensor into a digital representation. And so one of the first things
we like to look at is whether the residual noise in an image looks more like a natural image or an AI-generated image. Here, for example,
is our real dog and our AI dog. And here is the residual noise
that I've extracted. And if you look at this, it's not at all obvious that there's
any difference between those two patterns. But here, in this
visualization of the noise, you can see a decidedly different pattern between the natural and the artificial. Those star-like patterns
are a telltale sign of generative AI. Now, for the mathematicians
and the physicists in the audience, that is the magnitude of the Fourier
transform of the noise residual. For everybody else,
that detail doesn't matter, but you definitely should have taken
more math in college. (Laughter) Professors can't help themselves. So let's apply this analysis
to this image. Here's the noise residual
that I've extracted. And there is that star-like pattern
that you see in the bottom right. Our first suggestion
that something may be wrong here. But no forensic technique is perfect. And so you don't stop after one thing, you keep going. So let's go on to our next one,
the vanishing points. If you image parallel lines
in the physical world, they will converge to a single point,
what's called the vanishing point. A good intuition for that,
the railroad tracks. When I took this photo, the railroad
tracks are obviously parallel, but you can see that they narrow
as they recede away from me and intersect at a single vanishing point. This is a phenomenon that artists
have known for centuries. But here's the great thing. AI doesn't know this. Because AI is fundamentally,
as I just described, a statistical process. It doesn't understand the physical world,
the geometry and the physics. So if we can find physical
and geometric anomalies, we can find evidence
of manipulation or generation. Here in this image,
I've annotated four parallel lines on the parallel sides of the wall
in our basement photo, and you can see a lack
of a coherent vanishing point. That suggests a physically
implausible scene. Evidence number two. Alright, what else can we learn? Surprisingly, shadows have a lot
in common with vanishing points. Here, what I've done
is I've annotated a point on a shadow with the corresponding part
on the bottom of the rail that is casting that shadow. And I've extended those lines outwards. And they intersect,
not at a vanishing point, but at the light
that is casting that shadow. And again, this is a physical phenomena
that you expect in natural images. And because AI fundamentally
doesn't model the physics and the geometry of the world, it tends to violate these physics. Let's apply this analysis to our image. Here I've annotated
four shadows on the bottom from the soldiers' shadows to their legs. And you can see that the lines
aren't even close to intersecting. Not one, not two, but three anomalies. We now have a very good indication
that this image is not authentic. The most important thing
I want you to take away from this is that while it may not be easy, it is possible to distinguish
what is real from what is fake. I think this image is a bit of a metaphor
for how a lot of us feel. We feel like hostages. We don't know what to trust anymore. We don't know what is real. What is fake. But we don't have to be hostages. We don't have to succumb
to the worst human instincts that pollute our online communities. We have agency, and we can effect change. Now, I can't turn you all into digital
forensics experts in ten minutes. But I can leave you with a few thoughts. One, take comfort in knowing that the tools that I've described
and that my team and I are developing are being made available
to journalists, to institutions, to the courts to help them
tell what's real and fake, which in turn helps you. Two, there is an international standard for so-called content credentials that can authenticate content
at the point of creation. As these credentials start to roll out,
they will help you, the consumer, figure out what is real
and what is fake online. And while they won't solve
all of our problems, they will absolutely be part
of a larger solution. Three, please understand that social media is not a place
to get news and information. (Applause) It is a place that Silicon Valley
created to steal your time, your attention, by delivering you
the equivalent of junk food. And like -- thank you. (Applause) And like any bad habit, you should quit. (Laughter) And if you can't quit, at least do not let this be
your primary source of information, because it is simply too riddled
with lies and conspiracies and now AI slop, to be even close to being reliable. Four. Understand that when you share
false or misleading information, intentionally or not,
you're all part of the problem. Don't be part of the problem. There are serious, smart, hard-working journalists
and fact-checkers out there who work every day, because I talk to them every day, to sort out the lies from the truths. Take a breath before you
share information, and don't deceive your friends
and your families and your colleagues, and further pollute the online
information ecosystem. (Applause) We're at a fork in the road. One path, we can keep doing
what we've been doing for 20 years, allowing technology
to rip us apart as a society, sowing distrust, hate, intolerance. Or we can change paths. We can find a new way to leverage
the power of technology to work for us and with us, and not against us. That choice is entirely ours. Thank you. (Applause) Latif Nasser: We're doing rapid-fire
questions, you ready? Roughly what percent of images online
do you believe to be fake? Hany Farid: Depends on the platform. Signal-to-noise ratio
is getting close to one. Stay off of Twitter, of X, and stay off
of everything else for that matter. LN: So what do you think? HF: I would say we're getting
close to 50 percent. LN: Can you differentiate
between things that have, like, Instagram or TikTok filters or Photoshop
versus fully AI generated images? HF: Yes, but it's becoming
increasingly more difficult. LN: Are there any websites
a layperson can use to check? HF: No. By the way, this is a secondary problem, which is now people
are creating fake things, then going to fake sites
to authenticate them. And it's all getting
very weird, don't do it. LN: Last one, most important one. In CSI crime shows, when they say enhance, can you do that? (Laughter) HF: Yes. LN: OK, great.

7Xbm2F64_c0,"Imagine one day you are out for a walk
in a city you live or you visit, and suddenly you [come] face-to-face
with a giant minotaur. It's half man, half bull. His skin is made of wood. He is walking, galloping, rearing up. He opens and closes his blue eyes. He breathes, he cries, he growls. His arms can fend off traffic lights. And now he’s asleep
in front of the city hall, and people on their way to work
hear the creature snoring. (Imitates snoring) Amazing. As tall as a building, the city is a stage for him, and people are immersed in his world. Thirty years ago, my colleague François Delarozière, a designer, art performer, founded La Machine company. His aim to create large
theater experiences in cities. How? With huge animated machines. Since then, François' extraordinary
machines appeared in streets, boulevards, avenues all over the world. These machines have
no practical function at all. (Laughter) They tell stories
for cities and their citizens, and they bring all communities together to create perhaps a new common ground. In 2016, the French port of Calais
commissioned us a permanent art project. Two years later, the sea dragon appeared on the beach. He has two giant red wings
and a long blue tail. And he started his delightful promenades
around the historic streets of Calais. Spitting fire, smoke coming out of his body. The sea dragon is now
the new image of the city. (Music) I could say that he belongs
to the city and is loved by everyone. Thank you. (Applause) La Machine is based in Nantes, a French city on the Atlantic
coast of France. And our workshop is in a former shipyard where we now build the great elephant, the giant spider, the dragon horse, the Minotaur, the sea dragon, and others. It's a permanent beehive
with over 100 different trades and crafts involved. In our staff we have welders, musicians, mechanics, comedians, sculptors, engineers, roboticists and so on. Perhaps you would like
to know how we make it. First a drawing, then a model. The model is scanned
to generate a digital wireframe. Then we [make] wooden shells
for the skin of the animal, a metal structure for the skeleton, including hydraulic and electrical systems
to bring the machine to life. Then the construction can begin. The carpenters lead the way,
and other trades follow on. It takes around two years
from the design to the completion. And then we are ready
to operate a machine. An average of 18 operators
""drive"" the machine with joystick and exoskeletons. One person per arm and per legs. One operator for the head. Another one for the neck,
one person for the wings, one person for special effects,
one person for the tail, one pilot for the truck,
one guide and a director of operation. He is the soul of the machine. He gives technical but
also emotional indications. All operators are connected to him
with mics to make a realistic movement. Long Ma. Long Ma means dragon-horse in Chinese. Perhaps it's my favorite machine. Long Ma was commissioned by Beijing. And then, with this machine, we performed in several
cities in the world. In Ottawa, Long Ma was joined by a giant spider that we settled
on the roof of the cathedral. (Laughs) Big deal with the church. (Laughter) Ottawa, the administrative
capital of Canada, had a slogan at that time:
""Ottawa is not boring."" Of course not. 700,000 people came to see Long Ma and discovered the giant spider. And my God, they loved it. These shows are free. No tickets, no fences. It makes the city creative and inclusive. For people experiencing
a giant moving machine in their neighborhood, it can change the way
they see their own city. La Machine is not only
about street performances. We also develop large-scale spaces
for ongoing moving exhibitions. In Nantes, our home city, we created Les Machines de l’Île. Les Machines de l’Île
is a cultural facility to support the urban
regeneration program of the city, to make Nantes more attractive,
both for inhabitants and visitors. The cultural facility
includes the great elephant, who is working every day
on the old dock esplanade, and next to it,
the Carousel of the Sea World, with a living testimony to Jules Verne, who was born and grew up in Nantes. Why are these machines so special? La Machine are movement. La Machine are not just art,
not just entertainment. They tell stories,
but also they bring motion and emotions together in every person
from spaces and times. Our machines are poetic figures, and poetry has no business plan. But even if our shows are free, they generate great benefits
for shops, cafes, restaurants and huge free media coverage for cities. In Liverpool, one day, a giant spider appeared
magically on a building in front of the main train station. Hundreds of thousands of people
discovered the new face of Liverpool, and this image went around the world. Some cities with the machine
wish to improve their image, like Ottawa, Calais or Liverpool. Others choose urban planning issues. Like Nantes or Toulouse. Toulouse is in the south of France, and we presented to the mayor
of Toulouse in 2013 the Minotaur. Toulouse is the home of Airbus, like Seattle is the home for Boeing. And we presented to the leader
of aeronautics in Europe an old and antique figure. Crazy. Toulouse is an ancient city where myths and stories
of bulls are central, and this city is like a labyrinth. The Minotaur makes the link
between the past and the future. Last October, we created a new character, the Guardian of Darkness, for the second part
of the gigantic street opera. The Guardian of Darkness is both
a woman and a scorpion, and she is the alter ego of the Minotaur. (Music) (Music ends) 1.2 million people over three days, so proud of their city. Last night, I had a thought -- Thank you. (Applause) Last night I had a thought. In La Machine, we don't really use
artificial intelligence, but we definitely use
artistic intelligence to reimagine humanity. Thank you. (Applause)",unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dOtN6IQv3uw,"You're watching How to be a Better Human. I'm your host, Chris Duffy, and I love my job. I feel so lucky that I get to interview interesting, intelligent people about their work and that you watch. That is incredible to me. I'm so grateful. And yet today's guest, Sarah Jaffy, the author of Work won't Love You Back, Sarah argues that a lot of times when we have jobs that feel really good, where we like the people we work with and it feels meaningful, those are the jobs that burn us out the most because we end up feeling like we have to give everything to work, that we never leave any parts of ourselves for the parts of our lives that don't make money. So, what does it mean to actually find a work life balance? What does it mean to define your life, not just in how you make money and how you pay your bills? We're going to be talking about that and we're going to be talking about so much more. Everything from the aftermath of the pandemic to what happens when an entire industry is disrupted to what it means to grieve. We're talking about all of that and so much more with Sarah Jaffy. I'm Sarah Jaffy. I'm a journalist and the author of among other things, Work Love You Back: How Devotion to Our Jobs Keeps Us Exploited, Exhausted, and Alone, and From the Ashes: Grief and Revolution in a World on Fire. Let's start by talking about your book, Work Love You Back. You've done a lot of jobs. you've done a lot of jobs that are that are service jobs and then of course now you're a journalist. So, um you've kind of been on both sides where you work for yourself in a more creative way um and trying to cobble things together and then you've also been one where you're very much interacting with the general public. The title of your book kind of says it all, right? Work won't love you back. Can you tell us about how you arrived at that conclusion and why it's important to realize that? Yeah, I think really like you hit the nail on the head there, which is I went from all of the service industry work that I more or less hated to, oh, this is exciting. This is my dream job. I'm a journalist now. I've got, you know, I went to grad school. I did the whole thing. Redid my life. And my working conditions weren't that much better. And it, as I joke on my website bio, like I didn't make more money at first when I was a journalist. And so realizing that there was a lot in common there. And actually, I I will tell people all the time that um waiting tables is great training for journalism because you have to be able to sort of keep a straight face no matter what someone says to you. It's a really useful skill and being able to talk to people and like smooth things over when feathers get ruffled. Like all of these things that I learned waiting tables actually have stood me in greatstead as as a reporter for the last 16 17 years. But that sense that like oh I'm I'm not my life hasn't changed as much as I thought it was going to. I am still struggling to pay the bills. I was living in New York City when I started work as a full-time journalist, which like yeah, um that understanding that like, oh, like this is cool and I'm I'm glad I'm doing this. And you know, don't get me wrong, I I do not want to return to restaurant work, but recognizing that at the end of the day, work is still work and we are still doing it at the end of the day because we've got to pay the rent, not because we just like woke up that morning and decided that slinging sushi to tourists in Denver would be great fun. When I think about it in my own personal life, I often think that like school is such a clear it it's such a clear system, right? like whether it works or not. It's like we are doing work on this topic and there will be a test on this day and if you get enough of the questions right you get this quote unquote good grade and it feels like one of the really important pieces of the conversation that you have started with work won't love you back is that maybe the approval and the sense of worth should actually not be coming from the place that is paying you money like at the end of the day I need to have other things that give me meaning and give me um validation and give me the sense of of doing something important in the world. And like look, I still do the work that I do, which like let me tell you, there are many subjects that I could cover as a journalist that would pay better and have more job security than being a labor reporter, but I keep doing it because I think it's important. I talked to a lot of nurses. I talked to a lot of teachers, you know, I talked to a lot of people who are in these kinds of jobs where they are doing it because there is meaning in it for them. And we would want that, right? I don't I don't want my nurse or my doctor to like only be in it for the money. Right? There is that sense that like, oh, I get why we want that. You want your kids teacher to be engaged and care about kids, right? I would be a terrible teacher because small children terrify me. And again, when you think about doctors and nurses, it makes sense, right? I would like the hospital be to be run by the people who know about providing healthcare rather than the people who know about, you know, counting budget numbers. I think it's really hard if you're doing work that is like like you said a nurse or you're working at a nonprofit that's fighting to clean up the environment or you are working on u cancer research right like these things where it's like you are doing something that is so important and I'm sure it is extremely meaningful and maybe having a little bit more of a sense of like we can be agitating for a better world and we can push for better conditions rather than just thinking like well I have to take it as it is because this is the dream job or whatever. Yeah. Yeah. That that I think that's a really different way of thinking about work than many of us have. Yeah. I you know the the place that I started that I think really got me you know going down this particular front was the Chicago teachers union in 2012. You know they went on the strike that was this first big teacher strike in the US in a long time. And the argument that they made was our working conditions or our students learning conditions. And it was this really great way of it now um labor scholars and and organizers call it bargaining for the common good. And what they're saying is that actually if we are given better working conditions, if we are paid enough to actually live near the school that we teach in, if we have smaller class sizes, if there's toilet paper, they were literally bargaining to get toilet paper in the bathrooms on the first day of school. Like that's the kind of stuff they had to fight for. And so they sort of demonstrated their worth to the community by going on strike, which is the classic sort of labor tactic. But they also really had this innovative argument that was saying to people, you want our conditions to be better because it's actually good for everyone. And the same thing is true of these nurses that I've been covering um nurses at uh University Medical Center in New Orleans, which is it used to be charity hospital, but its purpose to be an open access hospital that serves everyone regardless of your ability to pay. that's been folded into University Medical Center and these nurses are fighting and they've unionized and they're planning now their third strike because they're still not getting what they want. This is where I we can also bridge the the line between the two books because you draw a line between people who worked in in coal mines and people who were working in care work and how for the coal miners um striking was very difficult but in some ways the care workers struggled more with the emotional side of striking because they didn't want to leave the people they were taking care of even though the conditions were unbearable. Yeah, Kevin. Oh my goodness, Kevin. I love him so much. Um, so Kevin was a former minor in England and he had been, you know, a coal miner through the the 198485 strike after which Margaret Thatcher basically like crushed the British coal industry and this had been nationalized. So in England, right, the government owned the mines. So they were striking against the government, not just some like faceless, you know, mind boss. And you know they lost they they got crushed and a lot of them went had to go into different industries and not a lot of the men for somewhat obvious reasons went into care work. You know he's this big guy who had been working down a mine for you know decades and then the mine shuts down and he goes into care and he's working with um adult men who have various special needs. And you think about it right because a lot of the people who do care work are like my size and I'm you know I'm literally the average size woman. I'm 5'4 and 130 something pounds. Like, if I have to restrain or lift or like physically interact with somebody who's a lot bigger than me, I'm going to hurt myself. M a guy who's 6'1 and has been working down a coal mine really really does bring something else to that work that like you know there there are reasons to have a big dude do that work sometimes but also he really loved it and he found it meaningful in a totally different way than the coal mine had been. But as you said the conditions still sucked and he was sort of more used to going on strike than a lot of the the people that he worked with and he had a lot of the women that he worked with because the coal mines were literally all men. It was illegal for women to work down the mines. So that that whole thing, you know, he was like, ""Okay, I'm ready to go on strike."" But a lot of the other people were like, ""Oh, this is really hard for me because yeah, we don't want to walk away from our patients because they need us."" The boss is the one screwing us over, not our patients. Right. I also thought that a really moving piece of of Kevin's story is that Kevin's experience of being in a coal mine with a labor union involved a lot of really caring for for other people for the the men that he was down there with in a dangerous situation and knowing that you could trust people and that they had your back even if the the bosses or the organization didn't. And that that actually was a directly transferable skill to caring for people because it was in some ways that the union was care work. It was just care work that they hadn't thought of in that way. Exactly. It was so striking, right, to talk to him and also to talk to Chris Kiten who is the the head of the union now, you know, and mostly his job because actually they closed down the last coal mine in Britain between when I finished writing this book and when we're talking and so there are literally no active members of the National Union of Mine Workers anymore. There are just retirees and people who have gone into other industries. And so when I talked to Chris Kitchen, you know, so much of his job was he's either fighting for retirey benefits and health care and things, you know, where where they have, you know, lung disease and things like that from going down in coal mines and breathing that air. And then he's going to commemorations and celebrations. Um but a lot of commemorations of mine disasters you know because there are a lot of horrible things happened in over the years over the centuries really of the British coal mining industry. And so it really struck me that like this man who is you know the leader of a coal miners union his job is care his job is fighting for these these you know his members healthcare and his job is commemorating it's grieving right it's commemorating the disasters and the people that were lost and that that was really true of the practice of of solidarity of being down the mine where it didn't matter if you like the guy next to you. If the wall starts to cave in, you're going to grab him and get the hell out of there. And then when I thought about, you know, when you talked about the the sort of entire social world of the miners outside of the mine that was built by the union, so the union had the minor welfare hall, which was where you would go have a beer after work with your buddies, and it was where you would have your wedding, and it was where your children would be, you know, christened or baptized or I don't know, I'm Jewish. Um, and like that space, right, that social space, all of that is what went away when the minds went away. What they miss is having a job that had some sense of purpose and having a decent wage that you could actually, you know, maybe send your kid to college so they didn't have to go down the mine. And to have that kind of social life that was built in these places around the mines, because the mines are not in the center of a big city, right? They're in rural Appalachia in the US. they're in the north of England. That entire the destruction of that entire way of life means these towns are just, you know, they're wiped out. And one of the things that um to bring this back to care work, the first monument that I saw to co workers, right, was in Barnsley, which is the same place that the headquarters of the mine workers union was in the north of England. And I don't think that's an accident because they're used to commemorating workplace disasters and CO was among other things a workplace disaster. When I was teaching in an elementary school, it's never like I was like politically rightwing, but I realized that I had some uh ideas about unions that ended up changing cuz I was working at a an a charter school without a union. I didn't like choose the school because I just chose it because that's where I could get a job. Um but when I was working there, I believed like, oh well, the union would just hold us back. It would just like protect the worst teachers. And over time, I came to understand that like there's all these structural forces at play and there's all these reasons why this job is really hard and there's all these reasons why these kids are struggling or not struggling and having um an organized piece where we all were in it together. Yeah. Would actually be like uh a dramatic thing even if this particular building didn't need it. That it's like it's a broader thing than just that. Right. Yeah. And it's so funny, right? Because the story that we were told about teachers unions, right? I remember hearing that growing up, you know, oh, they just protect all the bad teachers and the rubber room myth and all that stuff, right? And like the charter schools are going to be better because they make it easier to fire the teachers. Well, like then you look around, you know, and again, I live in New Orleans, which like our school district has one directly operated public school and it opened last year, but since Katrina, otherwise, it's been 100% charters. And like the results haven't gotten any better, but what you have is just a lot of turnover. Instead, I worked in a nonprofit very briefly with kids who are like 9, 10, 11 years old and like, oh my god, they're exhausting. They're amazing. They're exhausting. Teaching is hard. It gets better. Like, most skills do over time. So, you don't want to just like turn it over with like the new smart kid from this week who probably has zero patience with the kids. Like, you actually get better over time. And so, protecting your ability to get better over time is is really important. But also, yeah, like where are those those places where you're having conversations with other teachers so you can say to them like, ""Hey man, I had a really rough day this day, you know, this Tuesday and like this happened with this kid and I don't know what to do. Can you help me out?"" Those structures too are part of what the union does, right? This may be a kind of a question that you don't get that often, I think, which is like the kind of practical um service journalism side of this, which is like Yeah. like a person is listening to this Yeah. or they've read your book and they're thinking about their own relationship to work differently to their job. Um, what are three things that someone should do to start to re-evaluate the way that they think about work in general and their own relationship to it? So, the first thing I always say is like, yeah, talk to people. What do your co-workers think? How is everybody feeling about the job? Is it just you? It's probably not just you. Also, don't use your workplace email to do that. That's my my number one bit of service journalism is if you're talking about organizing, don't do it on your work email or the work Slack. Find out get people's phone numbers, use Signal, use a protected app, something else. But those conversations um they are the building blocks of of everything that comes next, right? If you are thinking about organizing, you can also reach out to an organization, a union in your field, depending on what that is, and they can tell you what the rules are. Um, for instance, you don't officially have to, if you are in the US, be a member of a union in order to have your collective rights on the job protected. So, you have the right under US labor law to organize and talk with and advocate for better conditions on the job with your co-workers whether or not you're in a union. Um, this is something that I jokingly call the newsies rule from, you know, the Disney music movie musical where he goes, ""If we strike, then we're a union. If we go on strike, then we are a union."" Right? American labor law basically says that's true. And then yeah, think about think about what your demands are and then what leverage you have to meet those demands. The thing that's true in a lot of these labors of love jobs, right, is that the boss will say to you, there are 20 other people just outside the door who would love to have your job. And that might even be true, might be less true than they think, but like you know, we are in a somewhat tight labor market, but mostly still, you know, the the good jobs are still hard to find. most of the jobs in the economy still are those, you know, waitressing jobs that I was doing. So, these questions of leverage are actually um really important and interesting right now. It's not so simple as just like get all your buddies and walk off the job. Um sometimes it's easier to stay on the job and and uh you can sit down on the job. You can do a work to rule action, which is where you do your job exactly to every possible last little rule in your job description, which turns out the boss never actually wants because they want you to be doing so much more. And you probably know how to do your job way better. You talk in From the Ashes about grief, both personal, professional, and societal. And I think that a lot of us of a certain age feel like a form of grief or sadness or regret at not being able to have this kind of like collective experience that it seems like existed in the past. You know, like my dad worked for the Port Authority. Yeah. Um, and I wouldn't say that he was ever like, you know what, my passion is is like helping manage toll collectors. Like I think he but but the idea that he could like come in and do a job and have a pension at the end of his career and he would know that he was taken care of and he took a lot of pride in doing a job well and being a good steward of public funds, right? For me and for certainly for people who are younger than me, the idea that you would be at one job for 30 years is so the exception and not the rule. we're living through this moment where like the public sector is just being demonized. And it's also really interesting because I think people are starting to realize that that's wrong. Part of what's happening and part of what the folks I've been talking to a lot at like the Federal Unionist Network and others, um they're really making a defense of the idea of the public good. The idea that there are jobs at the Port Authority, that there are jobs at the park service, that there are jobs at the Army Corps of Engineers. I live in New Orleans. Again, I would like the Army Corps of Engineers to still be well staffed, please. Cuz they keep us above water. You know, you you take a pay cut when you work in the public sector, right? You don't make as much money if you were an engineer with the Army Corps of Engineers as you could out in the private sector somewhere. But you do it because you believe in the idea of the public sector. You believe in the idea that like these are things we should do for the public good. Again, to go back to those nurses in New Orleans at University Medical Center, you know, they are saying like, ""We want to work in this kind of public hospital, this kind of open access hospital because we believe everybody should be able to get care."" What would it look like to actually say that like we want to run the world for the good of of all of us rather than the good of Elon Musk getting richer? um the good of everybody who drives a car or takes a train or a boat in the New York port authority or New Jersey or Yeah, New York and New Jersey. New York and New Jersey. Right. So, right. So, everybody who takes the Staten Island Ferry, which is one of my favorite public institutions. I love the Staten Island Ferry. It's free and you can get a beer on it. Wouldn't that be amazing if we had more public transit that was free and you could buy a beer on it? Maybe not everybody needs to buy a beer on it, but still. this idea that we have tried efficiency and productivity. I think a really new idea I got from from the ashes was the the idea of the way that grief works in our personal life. How it's not linear. It comes in waves. It's circular. Sometimes it's incredibly intense and then it goes away almost entirely and then it comes back. Um and how that personal grief Yeah. can actually be in some ways a roadmap for societal and communal ways of thinking about progress and of thinking about dealing with problems that it doesn't have to just be this straight incredibly efficient line from we are at A which is bad and we're going to B which is good. Um that that's not how it works. For people who haven't read the book, just to start. Yeah. From the ashes is, and please tell me if I'm wrong, but it is it is both the story of you grieving your father. Yeah. Who passed away, and it is a story of COVID 19 and de-industrialization and uh racism and uh societal failures. it it combines those really big macro problems and the incredibly specific personal issues that you were dealing with. Um, for people who haven't read that, how and why did you choose to do that? It's a lot, right? I think everybody, we will all lose people who are close to us. Um, people will die, people will leave our lives for a variety of reasons. A lot of us will lose jobs, homes, you know, we all went through the trauma of CO 19, although in different ways and experienced it differently. And to to sort of go through this moment of of grieving and my father died in 2018, so you know, it's gone been seven years now. And to look around at the stories that I was covering and the work that I was doing and realize like, oh, there's there's grief everywhere. And I had, you know, I had lost people. I lost my grandparents. Um I had certainly had my heart broken before. But losing a parent was something totally different and it was so destabilizing and so transformative. And suddenly everywhere I looked there was grief. And also like I was trying to find things to read cuz I'm a nerd and and I wanted to get an A in grieving the way I want to get an A in everything. And so I was looking for like what do I read? What do I study? What do I whatever. And like nothing nothing really captured what I was feeling. And so I on some level I wrote the book that I needed to read. You know, the way I deal with everything is to write about it. And this one has been harder to um metabolize than most. It's been it's been hard to talk about. Um doing press for this book has been rough. Um it's been challenging to um return to those feelings over and over again, you know, but because they returned for me anyway. you know, we just passed the anniversary of my father's death and and it's always like, you know, around that time. You know, his birthday was March 2nd and he died on April 2nd. So, like that month I know it's coming for me. But it also comes for me at at other moments. It comes for me in, you know, moments that I won't even know what's going on and I'll sort of be and then I'm like, oh, it's just okay. That's that's what's happening. That's there. And that sense that it's not just an easy thing to get over. It suddenly made sense when I was doing stories on like factory closures. You know, in 2018 was was Trump 1.0 and I was doing a lot of stories on on factories closing. I had been in Indiana. I had been in Ohio. Actually, the story is in the book where I was in Ohio. I was covering the closure of the Lordstown plant, which is kind of a famous auto plant, General Motors plant, um, just outside Youngstown, Ohio. And I was sitting in the office talking to Tim O'Hara, who was at the time the vice president of the union. And Dave Green, who was the president of the union, is now the regional director for the UAW in that area. You know, he just comes in and flops on the couch and looks over at me and goes, ""You know how they say there's seven stages of grieving? Well, we can't go through them because we don't know. We're stuck in the middle."" you know, and I was like, ""Huh, right. This is a grief story, except it's a sort of um disenfranchised grief is one of the terms for things like that, right? Where you can't really go through it because it wasn't clear what was actually going to happen to the factory. It has closed now since um some of the workers are now working for a battery plant in the area. Some of the workers got scattered all over the country, but at the time they didn't know. It was still early and they were still trying to fight to keep it open. and yeah, to realize like, oh, I'm I'm already writing grief stories. I'm writing stories of immigration and and talking to people about what they leave behind. Um, you know, then 2020 hits and we get COVID and then we get the George Floyd uprising and we just get this double whammy of of talking about grief in public, right? And whenever we say Black Lives Matter and we say, you know, say their names, we're talking about grieving. We're talking about, you know, that George Floyd should still be here, that Briana Taylor should still be here. You know, I I when I was working on the book, I talked to sort of therapists and clinicians and and practitioners about grief and about how they deal with it and how they help people deal with it. And so these are, you know, where I sort of learn these terms. And disenfranchised grief is is again a grief that can't be acknowledged, a grief that isn't recognized. people are carrying around a lot of unacknowledged pain and that comes out if we're lucky it comes out in ways that you know are just sort of messy. If we're really not lucky you know it it gets toxic and it can destroy your relationships. It can destroy your you know your grip on reality. It can destroy all sorts of things. Um it can destroy your health, right? It's it was so shocking to me how physical grieving was. You know, again, talking to clinicians and people, it was like, yeah, like I see people with like flare-ups of autoimmune conditions when they're grieving. Like all of these things happen and we just have no place for it for the most part in sort of late capitalist society, right? We just sort of are supposed to get back to work. You know, you say in the book that grief does not happen on the clock of capitalism. That that's not how it works. Um, so just to read it, it's um, many languages have a middle voice which is less concerned with agency. In the middle, the subject does not do or have something done to them. Neither can they simply opt out from or reverse the action of which they are apart. They undergo change while engaged in interactive processes from which they cannot simply withdraw. They are not and cannot be exterior to the process. And then you say, you are grieving, but grieving is also doing you. Yeah, that really hit me in the gut. the idea of I it's it is both you doing it and it doing you and it is it is active and passive and both that messiness of grief I think is what a lot of people really struggle with and and that struggle with not being able to articulate I joked about wanting to get an A in you know grieving but like it's really true like I was like I'm going to be good at this I'm going to go to therapy I'm going to do the thing I'm going to like get over it in record time and I'm going to be good at grieving and like no that's not how that works that is so not how that works. In fact, the more you try to do that, the more you're going to screw yourself up, I think. And to to be willing to like allow it to happen on on the clock that it happens at um it is, you know, it was easier for me in a way because I work from home, you know, I'm freelance. I had plenty of work I had to do, but I could kind of do it on my own time. So, if in the middle of the day I needed to take a break and just cry for an hour, I could go do that. you know, that that sense, you know, of like some degree of freedom that I had, which most people don't have, right? If you're you're going to work at the GM factory and you got to, you know, do the same thing all day long and you're, you know, lifting up the thing and drilling a hole or putting a screw in or attaching a door or attaching a steering wheel or any number of things you might be doing on an assembly line, you just got to do that. And you can't pause the line so that you can cry. And you can maybe cry while you're attaching the steering wheels, but you might screw it up. So, you probably don't want to do that. And also, you probably don't want everybody to watch you while you cry while you try to attach a steering wheel on the assembly line while the cars are going by you. Yeah, that that middle voice um it was from a piece that was sent to me by the author Namal Sarpel, who wrote this beautiful book, The Furrows, about grief. And it made me think about a lot of things that aren't work in that way that aren't sort of valitional in that same way. Um, and this is where I get really corny for a second, but like I also think that love is kind of like this. It happens in the middle voice. I, you know, I would sort of think like I have to be actively doing things all the time. And one of the things that grief sort of taught me is that I don't become unlovable because I need things for a while from people and I'm not always capable of immediately reciprocating. Like when my father died, the people who knew what to say and what to do were people who had lost a parent and they reached out to me and like I heard your father died. I'm sorry. You know, some people would be like kind of gallows humor about it and say, ""Welcome to the dead dad's club."" But it was it was people who had already been there. And so sort of by definition, they didn't need me to do it back. So the only way that I could reciprocate was to reciprocate to other people. So it was to bring it to build it out in that way. So that when I had friends in the months, weeks, years after my father died who lost somebody, I'm really annoying with this with people in my life actually. I'm like, you know, not to be relentlessly on brand, but you're grieving, honey. You know, and not just deaths, but also you lost a job. Also, you moved across an ocean. Also, you had a really bad breakup. you got divorced, you know, and I I I will be that person who's just like it's grief and you know, here's what you will probably need at some point. And you know, what can I do? But also asking what I can do is kind of not helpful because you probably don't know what I can do. So, I'm going to offer I'm going to make you breakfast. I'm going to make you cookies. I'm going to come over and drag you out of the house and make you go for a walk. Um, you know, I'm just gonna text and be like, ""Here's a very silly meme that made me laugh. Here's a picture of a cute dog."" I want to read two quotes from the book that are from really different parts. One is from the very kind of towards the very end and the other's towards the beginning. This first one is from towards the end. This is why I think I cannot stomach the grief platitudes industry. Grief is not joyful or peaceful. It is a war inside me.

t is an alien chewing its way out. It is a tornado somewhere beneath my lungs. It is breaking me and somehow people can't see. I want them to see and I'm terrified they will see. And I am both of these things at the same time being pulled in opposite directions like there's a team of horses attached to each end except somehow unbelievably I am stronger than the teams of horses and I do not get torn apart. That is such a unbelievably accurate description of grief to me. Um and yet so incredibly specific. Um, yeah. And that's the personal side of grief. Yeah. And then I just want to pair it with something you wrote at the beginning of the book, which is the societal piece of grief and the social movements, which is you say, I've covered social movements for the better part of two decades. And one thing that the ones that had stuck had in common was that they provided solidarity in a material way. They offered care that was physical, food, a place to sleep, masks, and hand sanitizer during CO 19. They offered life even when protesting a death. We lack a word in English for this kind of lifemaking like the missing middle voice. I've struggled in writing this book with the need for such a word, one that encapsulates the kind of world I want to live in and the way I want to live in it. It does not exist, I think, because we are not there yet. And to me, those two quotes really um capture so much of the beauty of this book and also the the thread that I had never seen someone else draw between that intense personal suffering and the way that we can find a path forward together, that it isn't something you solve on your own, that it is actually something you solve in community. Yeah. Yeah. I would not have gotten through the last six, seven years without the people who love me. And like I was very bad at asking for help. I'm still pretty bad at asking for help, but I'm getting better. last talk that I did for it in public. um my interlocutor with somebody who loves me very much and who literally held my hand through the conversation, you know, and those those moments where I had to realize that like this is part of it, you know, that one of one of those two people who squished me between them in the back of the car, you know, I was apologizing for being a mess and and needing to sleep on her couch and she was just like," """"That's what friends are for", you know, and I hear that in her voice still whenever I'm you know sort of being difficult to myself um it's just like oh right this is like what we build these relationships for is to be there and you know I am honored when those people call on me in those moments too you know that I want to be able to show up as much as they showed up for me and I want to be able to pay that outward to new people who haven't had to show up for me that way yet and that's what makes living in this screwed up world worth doing, you know, and that's also what gives us the the energy and the power not only to change it, but to believe we can change it, right? To believe that actually we're better than the worst things that we're told about each other. you know, one of those the federal workers that I was talking to, Colin Smallley, he's one of the he's um with the Army Corps of Engineers and you know, he was saying like that that these attacks on on the federal workforce or attacks on the entire idea that we should care about each other as humans and the way that we have organized that care in this world is through government. And like it's a little bit more complicated than that obviously, but like you know I I still do think like what would it be like again to organize a world around making sure everybody is cared for in that way. And not just because those people have like worked really hard at building up good personal social networks, but because we all deserve it and we deserve that time off when we need it and we deserve to rest when we need it and we deserve to be fed when we don't have the energy to cook for ourselves. And like just these basic basic things that like we can do, you know, as a world, as a society, we can make sure that everybody is cared for. Anyone who has been through grief and through suffering understands that one of the things that it does, and you say this explicitly, is that it just erodess your ability to take You have zero capacity for like the way things are, for people saying like," """"What's going on?"""" nothing much", you know, like you can't do that. Yeah. Jewish tradition teaches that when every every life is a world, right? So the end of every life is a whole world ending. And so when you have to imagine the end of your personal world, somebody that close to you that is gone that you can't sort of just go through the world in the same way. At first you can't imagine anything, right? Um but then slowly it's like oh well I have to imagine everything a new anyway and maybe in that space there is a possibility of imagining it better. Sarah Jaffy, thank you so much for being on the show. Thank you. Oh," it's been great.""",unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DM6UVe5jsxA,"Well, I gather I'm not the only one who spends a lot of time
thinking about AI these days. And by think I mean panic. I'm not even worried
about the doomsday scenarios because I have no way to assess those. I just think about what's going
to happen to jobs, because even if we solve
the AI safety problem, it's still going to displace
a lot of workers, maybe including me. Twenty years ago, I decided to take my very expensive MBA and use it to become a journalist. That decision did not have
what we MBAs like to call a ""positive expected cash flow."" (Laughter) When I was interviewing
for a job at ""The Economist,"" one of the interviewers actually
just asked me, ""Why are you doing this?"" I told him, ""I only have so much time on this planet, and I want to spend it
doing something that matters. And also, by the way, something
I really, really, really love to do."" I got lucky and it worked out. Today I'm a columnist
at the ""Washington Post."" But every day, AI seems to get better
and better at writing competent prose. And I don't know what I'm supposed to do if typing words in a row
stops being a semi profitable occupation. Now I'm a libertarian columnist, which means I believe in progress
and creative destruction. But here’s something I also believe: The Luddites had a point. (Laughter) Look, you don't normally hear
libertarians praising Luddites, so let me explain. Today, Luddite is a broad-spectrum
term for technophobes. But the Luddites weren't your mom
using a landline instead of a cell phone or sending you Hallmark cards
with little words underlined. They were skilled artisans
who made handcrafted textiles in an era when everyone wore
lovingly handcrafted textiles. Then mechanized mill owners
started underpricing them using some of the most cutting-edge
technology of their day, like, spinning jennies that could spin
thread at record speeds. So they decided to destroy the machines. Honestly, I have some sympathy. In fact, every time one
of these companies issues a new model, I get more sympathetic. We libertarians like to talk
about the glories of freedom and progress, and they are glorious. But they are not free. Sometimes people get hurt. Often lots of people. The printing press democratized knowledge and also witch burnings
and wars of religion. The Industrial Revolution
raised living standards and offset them with grim factory jobs, squalid urban living conditions
and choking pollution. Now modern governments
can allay many of those costs, but they can't give
people back the life they had. And we have an obligation
to count those costs. I mean, if only because no one
was ever persuaded by being told ""Your fears are stupid."" So here's why, even
after a full accounting, I think we should be willing to bear
those costs and let the future unfold, because we're all the beneficiaries
of previous decisions to prioritize future growth
over protecting the present. Very few people in this room
have ever worried about how they were going
to obtain food or shelter or heat, or how they were going to bury
a child who died of diarrhea before its first birthday. Those worries are the normal
condition of humanity. We escaped them only
through massive chronological luck. That is a precious and totally
unearned inheritance, and I think we have an obligation
to pay that forward and leave an even bigger legacy
for our descendants. To do otherwise, it's a kind of theft. It's stealing from the future. Picture what it would have looked like if the Luddites actually had managed
to halt progress in its tracks. Effectively, they'd have been
reaching forward in time and taking almost everything we have
in order to enrich themselves. Now, obviously, that's not how
they understood what they were doing. But it would have been true just the same. So picture that, really picture it. A spinner sells a few spools of thread
and suddenly you don't have a car. A weaver sells a handloom
cloak and whoops, there go your refrigerator,
your central heating and your college education. A whole suit of clothes and thousands of kids just died
of preventable disease. So when you're tempted
to halt the innovation that might compete for your job, you have to ask yourself, how much am I willing
to steal from my grandkids? I mean, from everyone's grandkids. Now, I know some people
in the audience are probably thinking, but that's different. We already have it really good, we've got airplanes
and mRNA vaccines and HBO. But of course, a Luddite
would have thought the same thing. They couldn't have imagined a future in which the average worker
is literally leading a healthier and more comfortable life than 19-century royalty. Others might be asking, quite reasonably, but what about global warming
and endangered species? I mean, is progress really all that great? Well, I'd ask you to remember
your last trip to the dentist and then reimagine it
without the Novocaine. Now I know the obvious retort. ""That's a libertarian canard."" You can want modern medicine without wanting us
to have burned all that coal. But my retort is that that doesn't work. The same Industrial Revolution
that led to global warming has also made us so rich that we could afford
to divert millions of workers from agriculture and weaving into science and medicine. It's also, as we've been hearing all week, giving us the tools
to fight ecological disaster. But we couldn't have predicted
any of that from the outset. We kind of had to live the change
in order to understand what it meant. Now, actually, it's worse than that, because it's often quite easy
to picture the near-term downsides. I mean, just read any article about AI. But the long-term upside
is much harder to grasp because progress is cumulative, and the longer it accumulates, the weirder it gets. So a final thought experiment. Imagine trying to explain
your life right now to a Luddite. Better yet, just imagine trying to explain the life of some ordinary
British working-class stiff whose great, great, great,
something, great grandfather was out there smashing machines. And I'm not just talking
about the ordinary stuff about daily living standards
like indoor plumbing. I mean, indoor plumbing
is extremely awesome. But imagine trying to explain
mass post-secondary education or the BBC. Nursing homes or bachelorette weekends. I mean, for that matter,
weekends and standardized time. How about suburbs and pizza delivery? And a nation so rich
that when a pandemic strikes, people can afford to wait that out at home while scientists, like -- ""What is a scientist,"" asks the Luddite -- while scientists rush out a magic shot that helps keep people from dying. To a Luddite, that would have
sounded like a fairy tale, and he'd be right. We are living in fairyland, and indeed, we all have magic wands in our pockets. I believe I see a few of you
waving them around right now. And I'm sure he'd have asked, ""But how could a spinning jenny
lead to all that?"" And it wasn't just a spinning jenny. It was an unprecedented wave
of innovation after innovation. Many of those innovations
put people out of good jobs, but collectively, they also
made it possible for us to be in this room together
or listening on the internet, rather than huddled by a smoky fire
knitting stockings to sell. The mill owners couldn't have
imagined what was coming, any more than Henry Ford understood that he was helping to speed along
the sexual revolution by creating mobile
love buggies for teenagers. (Laughter) They were just trying to make a profit. But we're the ones who profited the most. So to return to where we started. Yes, I am scared of AI. I assume that the government
is going to try to do something for displaced workers,
maybe provide them job retraining. But like the Luddites, I'm a human being
working in a proud tradition. I don't want a government handout. I want the career that I have spent
more than 20 years building. And still, when I'm lying awake at night and wishing and maybe trying to figure out
some way that I could stop this thing, or at least slow it down a little, I remind myself, I try to remind myself of all the reasons I shouldn't want that, even if I could. I don't have any right to steal
the future from our descendants, because I'm already living
in someone else's future. And it is literally better
than they could have imagined. Thank you. (Applause)",unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
u0fFIJapsRY,"I make audio documentaries, and I recently spent some time
in a town called Le Roy, New York. It's a town about 50 miles
outside of Buffalo. It's a small town. Its claim to fame is
that it's the birthplace of Jell-O. (Laughter) There's a museum and everything. Anyway, in 2011, at the beginning of the school year,
something strange happened in Le Roy. A student at Le Roy
Junior-Senior High School, a cheerleader, she wakes up from a nap with a stutter, like a severe stammer, trouble speaking. And pretty soon, that turns
into head tics and facial twitches, and then blurting out sounds and words. Symptoms that you'd associate
with something like Tourette's syndrome. A couple of weeks later,
while she's dealing with that, another student at the school
comes down with the same symptoms: tics, spasms, barks, blurting out sounds and words. And it happens from 0 to 60
overnight, out of nowhere. And then it happens to another student. And then two more. This is Rose. Rose was in eighth grade
at the time of the outbreak. (Recording) Rose:
At first it was whispers. It was like, ""Oh, it's this one girl. We don't know what's going on,
blah blah blah."" And the next thing I know, it's like doubling and tripling,
and it's all these girls. Dan Taberski: Jessica was
a senior at the time. Jessica: And I remember thinking,
were they making it up? What is going on? DT: People thought they were faking it. Jessica: Everybody thought
they might be faking it. And then my friend came to school
the one day, and I was at my locker. And she came up to me
and she was stuttering super bad. I'm like, ""What are you doing?
Stop fucking around. Why are you talking like that?"" And she's like, ""I can't."" She's, like, twitching,
she's crying at that point, just trying to get out her words, and I'm like, ""Holy shit.
This is real. What happened?"" DT: Within weeks,
the case count hits double digits. All at the high school. All girls. An investigation begins.
They test for Lyme disease. They test for heavy metals in the blood. Back at the school,
they test for the water safety. They test for the air quality.
They test for mold. And the only thing
spreading faster than the contagion are the theories about what's causing it. Rose: I remember hearing at some point,
since it was all girls, it must be a bad batch of tampons. (Laughter) DT: The tampon theory does not pan out. In fact, none of them do. After a month-long investigation, the state and the school board
and the and the doctors involved, they come up with
what they think is the answer. The outbreak ripping
through the high school is a mass psychogenic illness, otherwise known as mass hysteria. Emily was in eighth grade when she
came down with the symptoms herself. This is what her doctor told her. Emily: She basically said,
""It's all in your head. You're fine."" How are you, as a medical professional, going to look your patient in the eye
and be like, you're fine. Stop thinking about it.
You're fine, you're fine. DT: And she should be skeptical, right?
Especially because she's a woman. Even the word hysteria
has its roots in the Greek for uterus. For centuries, doctors
would blame the wandering womb for all sorts of problems
that women were having with their bodies, without really understanding
what it was medically. Back in Le Roy, this is how Jessica
reacted to the diagnosis. Jessica: I thought, ""That's bullshit.
I don't believe that. Seeing all these girls,
they're not making it up. I just don't believe
that that's the thing. After all of this, that's all it is?
I just don't know how to believe that. DT: I love that. ""I don't know how to believe that."" Not just ""I don't believe that.""
""I don't know how to believe it."" Here's what I have come to believe. I think we all need to start learning
how to believe in mass hysteria, because while it is very rare,
it is also very real. So say neurologists,
psychoanalysts, sociologists, so says the NIH. And it's a very specific type of contagion that says a lot about
how we're connected as people. Mass psychogenic illness
is the rapid spread of real physical symptoms
from one person to the other. But those symptoms
don't seem to have any organic cause. So you’ve got a limp,
but your x-ray is normal. Or you’ve got neurological symptoms,
but your MRI doesn’t show anything. Medically, these symptoms
shouldn't be happening. But then they begin to spread
from person to person. But it's not random. The spread of the contagion
tends to be a function of how connected
the victims are to each other. So students at a small town high school, or workers on a factory floor, or even nuns in a convent. In the Middle Ages, there were several cases
reported in Europe in convents, including one extended case in France where a nun supposedly
began meowing uncontrollably, only to have that symptom spread
to the rest of the nuns in the convent. And then, of course,
there's the witches of Salem, right? Perhaps the archetypical
women being hysterical. Many now believe that that was
a mass psychogenic illness. Why does it happen? There's usually some sort
of underlying stress or trauma affecting the people involved. Like, for example, in the fall of 2001, when a mystery rash broke out
in grade schools around the country, at least dozens and dozens of schools,
hundreds of students affected. The rash would pass from student to student
during the day in the school but then often disappear
when the kid went home at night. And then it would reappear the next day
and begin spreading all over again. Tests showed no bacteria, no virus,
no toxic exposure that would explain it. Turns out what may have been happening is that it was fear of toxic exposure
that caused the contagion. In fact, the mystery rash
began on the very day that the news reported
that a man in Florida had been diagnosed with anthrax, just weeks after they began appearing
in envelopes after September 11th in people's mailboxes. Many epidemiologists now believe that the post-9/11 rash
was a mass psychogenic illness, a real physical expression
of the collective anxiety those kids were feeling at the time. It's actually why I don't even care
for the phrase ""mass psychogenic illness."" It's more polite, perhaps, but it's ""mass hysteria""
that really gets the messiness of it. It's not just medical.
It's not just psychological. It's social. It's cultural. It's about all of us. And it's not just women. You may have heard of Havana Syndrome. That's the neurological medical mystery affecting foreign workers
in the United States and in Canada. Many people believe
that that is a mass psychogenic illness. And these things
don't just happen anywhere. They tend to happen
at the stress points in the culture. Or as one expert put it to me, they tend to happen
in the fissures of society. I want to play you some more tape. These are all taken from police body cams
of police officers in the field. In each instance, the police officer
has just come into contact with the street drug fentanyl. (Recording) It's so weird, man. He said he's floating.
His legs are tingling. Yeah, yeah, my toes are tingling. We have fentanyl! We have fentanyl! You're good, you're good. You're good. Keep breathing. Hey, stay with me, OK? It's warrant officer.
Possible exposure to fentanyl. I’m getting my -- you got yours out? All right. Relax. DT: You may have seen or heard
footage like this in the news. It pops up all the time.
Local news loves it. It makes great tape. We were able to track 332 cases
of accidental fentanyl poisoning among police officers in the field -- passing out, tingling, rapid heart rate -- all just because of proximity
to the drug fentanyl, sometimes even just knowing
its presence on the scene. But of those 332 cases
that we were able to track the number of actual toxicology reports that showed fentanyl in those
police officers' system at the time, as far as we can tell, one. At a state prison in Alaska. And even that one
hasn't been independently confirmed. In fact, the American Society
of Medical Toxicology says it is near impossible
to overdose on fentanyl in this way. And yet, it keeps happening. But it doesn't happen
to doctors and nurses who handle fentanyl in hospital settings. It doesn't even really happen
to fentanyl abusers who are obviously handling
the drug all the time. It's only in this one specific
preexisting social group: police officers, male police officers, incidentally. The phenomenon that many people believe
is a mass psychogenic illness, with a particularly modern twist. The thing about mass hysteria
is that it's a line of sight thing, right? Part of the reason you get the symptoms is because you see somebody
having the symptoms themselves. But with the advent of police body cams, each psychogenic overdose
also creates a video. And that video then gets seen
by other police officers, which potentially creates
more psychogenic overdoses, which creates more videos -- you see the problem -- creating perhaps
the perfect vector for spread. Back in Le Roy, the outbreak there followed a pattern
of many mass psychogenic illnesses. It came on strong, it wreaked havoc, and it faded away. Why there? It's impossible to say for sure,
but we do now know that some of the girls were experiencing their own personal,
private, traumatic situations that may have contributed
to their susceptibility. And of course, once mass hysteria sets in, it kind of brings
its own stress and trauma, as does just being
an American teenage girl today. Before it was over, 19 girls at the high school
came down with symptoms. All of them somehow
connected to the others. Several of them were
on the soccer team together. Several of them shared
a very specific art class, and two of them were best friends. By the time summer break arrived, the symptoms were all but gone
from the high school. Almost. Remember Rose? She was the one with the tampon theory. Rose never caught
those Tourette’s-like symptoms that ripped through
the high school so severely because Rose already had Tourette's. She has since she was three. Rose: I had always had very prominent tics
from the time I was diagnosed, like I had facial twitches, I would go through spurts
where I would be throwing things. I was always very loud,
like I always have very loud vocal tics. You will always hear me.
Everybody always knows who I am. DT: Unfortunately for Rose, when people with tic disorders
are around other people who tic, both people tend to tic more severely. So you can imagine when 19 other girls
are walking the halls ticking, Rose’s tics got worse. Much, much worse. Rose: So I had a tic where I would
punch myself right here in the face, over and over and over. DT: And your chin. That was your tic. Rose: My tic was literally
to coldcock myself. I have permanent damage in my right eye because my other tic
was to punch myself in the eye. I was literally beating
the shit out of myself. DT: Rose had a really difficult year, to say the least. But it was something she told me
about her life now that struck me about this idea
of contagion and connection. Rose: So I volunteer at Tourette
Syndrome Camp every summer, right? DT: Wow. Rose: And I love it. It is one of the best things I do
with my life every year. It's so amazing. But we all tic so much more
because we’re all ticking. DT: Does that feel good or bad? Rose: Oh, I love it. (Laughter) DT: At Rose's Tourette's Camp, when the contagion comes on,
they let it happen. They don't hold back. Rose: It is so worth every second of it, because you are having the best time
and you are around your people. And there’s something
called tic shopping. That’s the actual name for it.
And you can pick up other people’s tics. DT: They're literally
sharing their symptoms. They're passing them
back and forth unconsciously. And even if just for one weird,
humid, buggy weekend in the summer, they're able to revel in those symptoms and really appreciate
the connection that it gives them. Rose: So I always have to take
the day after camp off, because I’ll come home
with God knows what tics. But it's like the best feeling ever. It is the best feeling ever. DT: The line between contagion
and connection is a thin one. Sometimes it's hardly there at all. Thank you. (Applause)",unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rmASLb_Yn5Y,"How many of you are familiar with the word
""unalive"" as a synonym of ""kill""? Show of hands. OK, like, 80 percent of you. Great. Now, follow-up question. How many of you have heard
the word ""unalive"" being used in person? OK, I'm getting, like, 40, 50 percent. Great. Those of you that said no
clearly aren't middle-school teachers. (Laughter) If you spend enough time
around seventh- and eighth-graders, you will hear them using the word. It’ll mostly be in informal situations but could show up in contexts
like a student's essay on Hamlet's contemplation
of unaliving himself, or a classroom discussion on the unaliving
that happens in ""Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde."" And these aren't hypothetical situations. These are actual examples drawn from the 1,000-plus
middle-school teachers I've surveyed about this word. It's a weird hobby of mine, I don't know. Clearly, for such a recent word, ""unalive"" shows up
in an impressive range of scenarios, but the main function
appears to be euphemistic. Many kids use the word when they're uncomfortable
talking about topics like death, since “unalive” sounds
like a less scary word. And in many ways, this is nothing new. We've been euphemizing death
as long as we've had language. The word ""decease,"" for example,
comes from Latin ""decessus,"" which was a euphemism for the previous
Latin word for death, ""mors."" Apparently, even the stoic Romans were as queasy about death
as today's middle schoolers. But there is a crucial difference
between ""unalive"" and ""decease."" And that's that we only got
the word ""unalive"" because you can't say ""kill"" on TikTok. They have a mysterious algorithm
that removes or suppresses any post that might violate
their community guidelines. So people got around that
with the word ""unalive."" The middle schoolers don't know this. They see the word online
or hear it from friends and assume it's a word like any other. And fair enough, you probably didn't know
where the word ""deceased"" came from, unless you're some kind of etymology nerd. (Laughter) But ""deceased"" didn't happen because it was impossible
to carve the word ""mors"" into an ancient Roman tablet. We are entering an entirely new era
of language change, driven by social-media algorithms. As a linguist and content creator, I've been in a unique position
to see this happen from the inside. It's almost paralyzing. I constantly feel how my own
language is being affected, and judging from the 40 percent of you
who answered both of my questions, it’s beginning to change
your language, too. And it's not just new words
to avoid algorithmic censorship. The very structure of social media
is changing where words come from, how words get popular
and how quickly those words spread. I believe some of you
might be familiar with this song. (Clears throat) (Laughter) “Sticking Out Your Gyat for The Rizzler” (Laughter) “You’re so skibidi /
You’re so Fanum tax / I just want to be your sigma / Freaking come here /
Give me your Ohio” (Laughter) For those of you out of the loop, these are the lyrics to the Rizzler song, a meme that went
massively viral last year. It's full of current
middle-school slang words, like ""rizz,"" ""gyat"" and ""skibidi,"" and was instrumental in popularizing
those words to a broader audience. This is because social-media
algorithms reward repetition. If a song is funny or catchy
and people interact with it, the algorithm will then push
that song to more people, since it's proven to drive
engagement on the app. The same is true of memes,
or words in general, since trending metadata, like hashtags, will also be pushed to people
who had previously shown interest in similar content. Creators are very aware of this, and we actively use
trending audios or hashtags to make our videos perform better. In the wake of the Rizzler
song, for example, we saw an explosion
of people making videos with the words “rizz,” 
“gyat” and “skibidi,” because they knew
those videos would do well. And as a result, the words spread. Language has always been
a little bit like a virus. Words are transmitted
from one host to another, reproducing and changing as they infect
different people along social networks. But now, the viral nature of social media is accelerating this process,
from start to finish. In the span of just a year, a word like ""rizz"" can go
from complete obscurity to becoming the Oxford English
Dictionary word of the year. (Laughter) And the algorithm is the culprit, but influencers are the accomplices. We use whatever tricks we can
to keep you entertained, because that makes our videos do better,
which helps us earn a living. This means that we often end up
creating and spreading words that help the system. For example, the suffix ""-core"" has recently gotten
very popular in Gen Z slang to describe specific aesthetics, like cottagecore
or goblincore or angelcore. And on the surface level, these are cute. (Laughter) You watch a cottagecore
video, you like it. Later on, you get more
cottagecore content. You might even start to identify
with the cottagecore aesthetic. But here's the thing -- it's all fake. The entire reason these aesthetics exist is because the TikTok algorithm
has decided that words like cottagecore qualify as trending metadata, so creators respond by making
more cottagecore content that propagates the word, and then more people interact with it,
which makes the word trendier. And this happens
because social-media algorithms want to make you identify
with hypercompartmentalized labels, since they can then give you
extremely specific, commercialized content catering to that identity. Now that you’re a cottagecore person, you feel special every time
you get a cottagecore video. You’re like, “Cottagecore ... Well, the algorithm really knows me."" (Laughter) The algorithm gave you that identity. You might even start buying cottagecore clothing
or cottagecore decorations to fit your new lifestyle
as a cottagecore person, and that's exactly what they want. The craziest part is they're not
even trying to hide this. TikTok's business platform openly claims that subcultures
are the new demographics, and then gives businesses
ideas for how to profit off the cottagecore aesthetic. Essentially, they're driving the mass
production of identity-building labels in order to profit off all of us. And while there’s nothing wrong
with being on cottagecore TikTok, it is a kind of echo chamber that affirms
your cottagecore personality. The same is true of any niche community
created on social media. And on one hand,
this is great for linguistics, because language change is always
driven by groups with shared interests that have a shared need
to invent new words. ""Unalive,"" for example, became a thing because mental health
communities on TikTok needed a way to share their stories
and spread resources. On the other hand, some of the linguistic communities
created by the algorithm can be actively harmful. Many younger people have started
using the suffix ""-pilled"" to mean ""convinced into a lifestyle."" If I recently discovered that I really
like eating burritos, for example, I can say I’m so “burrito-pilled.” But that word was formed
through analogy with black-pilled, a term meaning ""convinced
into incel ideology."" Now incels are a dangerous,
misogynistic group. They've perpetrated
multiple terrorist attacks that have killed dozens of people, and yet somehow, their vocabulary
is filtering into Gen Z slang, because the algorithm
gave these hate groups a space. I like to consume
videos about urban design, and a few months back,
I got a video about how great it is to be a “parking lot-pilled
pavement princess.” (Laughter) Admittedly, I found the video
pretty funny and I liked it, which ended up giving me more
urban-design incel-themed meme videos, like one about being fossil fuel-pilled
and bad to the bone, and another about being
a walk-pilled cardiomaxxer. (Laughter) And a lot of people
similarly encounter these words as they spread in ironic or meme contexts. Let's take another look
at the Rizzler song. The lyric ""I just want to be your sigma""
refers to the concept of a sigma male, which incels use to describe
their desired position outside of the social hierarchy. And again, on the surface level,
it's a funny meme. It's innocent. Many people don't even know
where it came from. But for the few people who might be interested
in the underlying idea, it's now more accessible to them because of the way that slang
spreads on the internet. It starts in some corner of social media,
becomes a viral meme, and along the way, the etymology
is lost to a lot of people. And this doesn't only allow
communities to harm us, it allows us to harm communities. Two of the main demographics
that come up with modern slang are the gay and Black communities, since marginalized groups
consistently use language as a way to reclaim power. All of our most popular
internet slang words -- ""slay,"" ""serve,"" ""bussin,"" ""queen,"" ""cooked,""
""ate,"" ""gyat,"" many others all come from queer or Black culture. These words originated
as a form of creative expression, independent from the straight white
norms of the English language. But when those words
began to be used online, they were quickly taken by people
who wanted to capitalize on the perceived coolness or comedic
value of Black and queer culture. When a word like ""gyat"" goes from an African-American English
pronunciation of ""goddamn"" to being used as a noun for ""butt""
in memes like the song, it's ultimately exaggerated in a way that makes a farce
of its pronunciation and meaning. Its original importance is diluted
as it becomes widespread, and you can be sure that none
of the middle schoolers saying ""gyat"" are aware of its etymology. Unfortunately, just like the euphemism
of ""unalive"" isn't new, the appropriation of African-American
English also isn't new. We've been whitewashing Black slang
since the days of ""cool"" and ""high five,"" which, at this point,
have become so mainstream they're just seen as regular words. But once again, social-media algorithms are a vehicle enabling
and accelerating this process from start to finish. They create communities that feel like they have a space
to use their words, and then open up those communities, just enough to allow
those words to spread. That's how we got ""unalive."" That’s how we got “cottagecore.” That's how we got ""sigma,""
and that's how we got ""gyat."" Whenever I post a video
talking about one of these topics, I inevitably get the exact same comment. ""We're so cooked"" -- (Laughter) meaning ""we're so screwed."" Ironically, this is also TikTok slang
coming from African-American English, but I wanted to address it. Are we in fact cooked? (Laughter) I know I've just painted
a very bleak picture of the future of the English language, and there are a lot
of concerning trends to unpack. But these trends all do follow
the same historical patterns that we've seen time and time again. I don't think we're sliding
into a dystopian ""1984"" scenario, because we're always coming up
with new ways around media censorship. If a word gets banned, we'll just come up with another word,
like we did with ""unalive."" I don't think middle schoolers
are suffering from brain rot, because younger generations
always latch on to new slang as a way to build identity, and their older generations always say,
""Ah, you're ruining the language."" But just like the people saying
""cool"" and ""high five"" back in the day, the middle schoolers saying
""rizz"" and ""gyat"" and ""skibidi toilet"" won't be incapable of writing an essay. I don't think our vocabulary
is being corrupted by the commercialization of our language. We already use brand names
like Kleenex and Google in everyday conversations, so “cottagecore” isn’t about to turn us
into mindless consumer drones. I don't even think we're dangerously
normalizing incel rhetoric. If anything, our slang is built
on a shared mockery of incel ideas. When a kid says something like
""I'm so burrito-pilled,"" they’re not saying that
because they’re black-pilled but because the underlying idea
is making fun of how incels talk. In fact, I think each of these words is a beautiful, colorful addition
to the English language that reflects the diverse
cultural moment we're all in. But I do think we should be aware. We should be aware
when the way we're talking may have been conditioned
by the algorithm. We should be aware
when the words we're using may have been engineered
to sell us things. We should be aware when our language
regurgitates extremist rhetoric. And we should be aware when that language
can be used to harm other people. We should be aware
of etymology in general, because it helps us better understand
who we are today. We should be aware. And with that, I have just one final
piece of slang for you. It's a common phrase
used by younger people when we finish a long-winded
explanation of something. “Thanks for coming to my TED Talk.” (Cheers and applause)",unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
UbzsTXDvhAQ,"You're watching How to be a better human. I'm your host, Chris Duffy, and today on the show, we're talking about humility. Anyone who knows me knows that humility is not my strong suit. I have a big head, both literally, regularsized baseball cap. As you can see, it does not fit. It's also true metaphorically. I'm a comedian. I think strangers should be silent and listen to me talk while I'm on stage. I host a podcast called How to be a Better Human. Not the humblest of things to do. So, it's very important for me to talk to today's guest, Dr. Tanal Porter, a researcher who studies humility. That's going to be big for me personally. Tanal studies a specific kind of humility, intellectual humility, which is the idea that we might be wrong, that maybe we don't actually know it all, and I cannot wait for you to hear from Tanil about what it is that she's learned from studying this and how it can be applied in our lives. Maybe by the end, my head will have shrunk. Literally, probably not. figuratively. I mean, also probably not. Hi, I'm Dr. Tanal Porter and I am an assistant professor of psychology at Rowan University. So, Tal, let's let's start with the fact that you study intellectual humility. That is something that I think many people are probably not familiar with. So, what is intellectual humility? Intellectual humility means understanding what you don't know and recognizing that you might be wrong. Of course, all of us think that we're right and sometimes we are right, but that feeling of being right is is a subjective experience and it doesn't always match reality. So, intellectual humility is really about understanding that our knowledge is partial, that nobody knows everything there is to know and therefore we sometimes get things wrong. Can you give me an example of like what it would look like to move from whatever the opposite of intellectual humility is, intellectual hubris maybe, um, into intellectual humility? For me, an experience that I've had occasionally is like being positive that there's only one way of seeing things, that there's only one way the world could exist and then learning that, oh, actually there are multiple possibilities here. And I imagine that's kind of a little bit of what this is, but I wonder if you have like a specific example that can illustrate this for people. I was taking an international flight. So I was flying to to England on a redeye. I was in a window seat and we were just about done with boarding. The last few people were coming on and a woman came on the plane and kind of stood outside my row and said, ""You're in my seat."" And I said, ""No, I'm not. I'm in 34A."" And then the woman in the middle seat said, ""Well, I'm in 33B."" It was just very clear that, oh, I'm in the wrong seat. I was totally wrong. I'm so sorry. Let me get up and everybody has to get up. And you may not have had that experience of something so simple of getting into the wrong seat on a plane. But every single person has had that experience of being like totally wrong about something cuz we're humans and that's part of what it is to be human. It also seems to me like this is a field of study that I would have imagined was kind of intellectually interesting in the past and now feels like directly relevant to our everyday lives and survival of our species and societies. So holding space for the possibility that we might be wrong is not a new idea. philosophers have written about it as like something that we ought to be doing to have a good life. I think what's new now is that we're starting to study it scientifically, but it of course has bearing in so many different contexts and domains. How do you study this scientifically? We try to measure intellectual humility or we try to do experiments that will kind of change how intellectually humble people are or feel comfortable being in a in a certain context. Right now I'm working on a different kind of measure um where we're actually going to take high school students and ask them what they think about cell phone bans. So should they be allowed to have their cell phones in classes? Lots of high school students have really strong opinions on this issue as you might imagine. And instead of asking them to say like, ""How humble do you think you are about this issue?"" We're going to ask them to actually engage with perspectives that don't agree with them. So, how many, you know, reasons uh from a student who disagrees with you on this would you want to read? We'll look at their behavior on this computer task and use that to measure how intellectually humble they are. Are there ages or phases where we are more intellectually humble or is it kind of one of those things where we have this moment at the beginning of our lives and then afterwards we just have to really work hard to become humble again? It's interesting. We're trying to learn about that still. So there's stuff that we don't know about that yet. But you know if you ask like a like a four-year-old how much do you know about trucks or why frogs look the way they do? A four-year-old is going to say I know everything about that. As kids get into school, they start to get better at calibrating how much they know and how much they don't know. And that accuracy is sort of like a nice trajectory that keeps getting higher and higher as they go through school. And there's this idea too that with teenagers that like, oh, this must be a period when the humility like hits the floor. That's not really what we see actually. Teenagers aren't any um more narcissistic uh than anybody else. They're actually a little bit better than super young kids at knowing what they know and what they don't know. Thinking about the whole lifespan. Yeah. Something that I've seen um in my data is that sometimes as people get older, they're they're more intellectually humble. It's almost like with experience you really come to just appreciate this fact of being a human being which is that we're we're all fallible. What is the opposite of intellectual humility? Is there a term for that? The opposite of intellectual humility is intellectual rigidity. That's like extreme certainty. But I think that what you're saying here also makes me think about the the interaction between confidence and humility. M it's like this idea that can you be confident and intellectually humble at the same time? And I think that the answer is yes. And I think that you even have to have a certain amount of confidence to be able to show intellectual humility. It's like I'm so confident that I'm willing to be vulnerable in this way. Dil, you're you are a professor who is able to explain your work in a way that I think anyone would really be able to understand. I always think that that's really like a mark of confidence, right? Of confidence in your work and in your mastery of the field because it's really easy in academia to hide behind jargon, hide behind, you know, complex ways of saying simple things. Sometimes people hide behind that and I think that is like a lack of confidence in themselves and in their research. Yeah. Well, that's a great compliment. That's the best compliment that I've received. Even putting the the confidence or competence aside, it's so much more pleasant to be with someone who can just say, ""I actually don't know."" Agreed. And I think something we're seeing with intellectual humility is that it's one of these things that does really help relationships. I was listening to something the other day and it was about this test that you can ask on a first date and you can ask someone, do you believe in ghosts? And the whole program I was listening to was about how the answer to this question will tell you a lot about the person. So if they answer like no, absolutely not. I do not believe in ghosts and there's no information that you could ever provide to me to show me that ghosts are real. They're like really rigid. You're learning something that like this is going to be like a kind of black and white thinking person. But if they're like, I don't actually believe in ghosts right now, but if maybe you could show me something to convince me that ghosts are real, I would change my belief. Like this is a marker of intellectual humility. You know, when you think about intellectual humility in that way, which is that you can be really rigid on one side or really rigid on the other, but then somewhere in the middle is this more flexible, intellectually humble state. It feels to me like we are in a a cultural moment where there's very little cultural capital in having flexibility and there's quite a lot of cultural pressure to be rigid in your beliefs. I think that I do feel that. I especially feel that in online settings. I think that when it comes to interacting face to face that uh we're not as sort of dogmatic and rigid as we appear online. And what this makes me think is to what extent we need um big cultural shifts or big context that can support intellectual humility for it to really thrive. So like what could a regular person do to create more environments for intellectual humility to thrive both in themselves and also in the interactions they have? What could a regular person do? Um I try to model intellectual humility as a teacher. It really sets the tone for students and it really licenses them to be able to express that uncertainty or just take a risk to admit oh I don't know what does that mean? I don't know what that means. when I have said you know I know a lot about this topic but I don't know everything there is to know or you actually know this thing that I don't know so you can help me understand that especially when we're in those positions I don't know if power or influence like a teacher in a classroom that can be really powerful in setting the tone for that whole context I know you did a really important study on intellectual humility with teens I feel like that same thing is a real skill that many people are learning in teenage years, which is that you're figuring out what your story is versus what other people's story are and whether you want to be part of the group or want to be separate from the group. That's like a big piece of at least my experience with teenagers and it felt like people around me. Can you talk to us both what you did with the study on teenagers and then also why you picked that particular age? I worked with teenagers when I was in college as a youth mentor and it's just the stage of life that I think is really challenging and really rich. So much is happening that it fascinated me. So, there's this idea out there that maybe at this time of life when you need to be separating from your parents, like kind of breaking out on your own, that maybe what you need is like a really extreme confidence and kind of like a stride and see to help you make that difficult transition. Like that's one story that we tell ourselves about teenagerhood. Another story that's possible is like, well, maybe it helps teenagers to be a little bit more flexible and open and intellectually humble about what they believe. Either one of those could be true. So, I was curious, what would intellectual humility in a teenager actually do to them? So, we wanted to know, would intellectual humility relate at all to how successful they were in school? And we found intellectually humbler teenagers were were doing better in school. They were learning more. They were more kind of persistent. So, if they got a bad test grade, they were like, ""Okay, I'm not giving up. Like, I'm going to figure out what's going on and try harder next time."" They were more receptive to feedback and they're more likely to kind of incorporate that feedback in a revision going forward. And all this culminates in earning higher grades, which is a marker of learning. So, in a word, the intellectually humbler teenagers were learning more. any findings that you found about intellectual humility that have really surprised you because they've been counterintuitive maybe. So, we could think about intellectual humility as something that's happening in your head and something that you can also like show to the world. So, I can be aware that I don't know something, but am I going to admit that to you? And something that is surprising to me is that we see sometimes if you're really really turned way up in terms of how aware you are of the stuff that you don't know, that can actually make you a lot less willing to show that to other people. So it's getting into this question of what is intellectual humility and what's the opposite of it. At one end of the extreme, the opposite is something like rigidity, too much certainty. But there's another extreme we could talk about which is like too much obsessing over what you don't know and getting kind of mired down with all of the limitations. And I imagine it stops you from taking any sort of action cuz you're like well I don't I know that I don't know everything and maybe I don't know enough so I shouldn't actually do this thing. I should stop and get more feedback and do more research and you'll never know it all. So maybe you just never do anything. Exactly. In my family, we like to call this analysis paralysis. When it comes to intellectual humility at any age, what we want is the balance between something that is super rigid and something that is like super just uncertain. We're trying to find something that's well calibrated. When you go to like an academic conference on intellectual humility, is it just everyone presenting and being like, ""Well, I I'm not sure about this, but I might be wrong, but you I here's an idea that I have."" Is it just people like everyone's hedging their bets constantly and not actually like saying a a definitive statement because they're not positive that their research is actually totally sound? It's interesting that you should say that because I have had the experience of presenting on intellectual humility to people who don't study it and I do think it has an effect on the audience such that they become nicer. Their questions are kinder. They're a little bit like yeah it puts them in this frame of mind that's like remember you don't know everything and you might be wrong. So I really have experienced that. I love that you also have a a way of speaking that I'm wondering is if it's a chicken or an egg thing where it feels very intellectually humble in that you like are thoughtful and you consider your words. Do you feel that you've started to think and speak differently as you learned more about intellectual humility or do you think that you always were kind of a thoughtful choosing your words speaker and then that is maybe partly why you were drawn to this in the first place? I think it's both and I think I was drawn to it. I've always been kind of thoughtful, kind of careful, but it's way more like way more since studying this. I will say something and then I'm like, do I really believe that? Is that really true? Huh? Are there ways to encourage intellectual humility in others without saying outright, you should have more intellectual humility? You have got to practice what you preach. intellectual for me first and then intellectual humility for thee. So if you really want your brother who disagrees with you about politics to show intellectual humility to you, try showing it to him first and see what happens. It's not a guarantee, but it's going to work a lot better than yelling at him to be more humble. I would have really loved it if on the plane when I was in the wrong seat, I would have been proven right. It was very painful to be that person. There's a psychologist named Frank Kyle who's also studied intellectual humility and I remember at a talk once somebody was saying this like, ""But I just feel so bad when I'm wrong."" And Frank was like, ""It's great to learn that I'm wrong. This is learning. This is so exciting. And so maybe there are people out there who have reframed it in a way that it is like discovery. And maybe if we could all do that a little bit more, intellectual humility might become a little easier. That framing also makes me think about how a lot of these skills that are uncomfortable or painful at first are in some ways muscles, right? Like that you can strengthen them and they get better. I I just think about for myself, one of the things that people ask the most frequently when they find out that I perform standup comedy is, ""Oh my god, have you ever bombed? It must be so horrible to get up there and have no one laugh."" And what I always say is that like, of course, I've bombed. Some audiences would say that I've never stopped bombing. But uh I think what really has changed is like when you first perform and you get up there and you think you're going to say something funny and you say it and no one laughs, that first time is excruciating. And now if I tell a joke and it does not get any reaction from the audience, that is actually really just helpful information for me. Like, oh, something's not working about that. It's not like you're a terrible, disgusting, horrible human and you're horrible at your job. It's like there's there's some information there that I can take away. I imagine there's similar um exposure therapy or um work and muscles and practice that you can do to to feel like accepting your intellectual limits isn't as painful as it is at first. I think that's absolutely right. It is one of these things that we can develop through practice. I have met people who have really strong intuitions in the other direction. the idea that well some people are kind of born this way and other people aren't and there's just nothing we can do about it. But this is one of those places where I'm gonna stick to my conviction that training this is really possible and worthwhile and it's really exciting to to like push forward and progress and learn something new. So thinking about this, what are some things that people can do to build intellectual humility in themselves or to practice it in their daily lives? what can they do? I'm like so much of my research is like about what can other people do to help other people develop it or what does it do when you have it? But okay, here's one thing you can try to build intellectual humility. If you find yourself in a conflict and you see things differently than somebody else, you just disagree. Take a step back, just remove yourself from the situation and then imagine looking back on this situation from 20 years in the future. or imagine that you are a fly on the wall watching this play out. When we get a little bit of perspective, um it often just opens us up a little bit to intellectual humility. So that's one thing you can try. Another thing you can try to build intellectual humility is just remind yourself of the benefits of being this way. There's a lot in our culture that says intellectual humility is not good. It makes you look weak. It's not going to help you. But there's also a lot in our culture that says, ""No, this is this is a good way to be. This is a really good way to connect with other people. This is a good way to learn something new. This is an honest way to be because we are humans and no one is infallible. So remember the benefits. Three, if you're finding yourself in a place where you're you're really struggling to see eye to eye with another person or even listen to them, you can just like take a moment again, remove yourself and just reflect on your values. Like what are some values that are really important to you? Just a way of just getting in touch with what's important. It kind of anchors the self so that you're feeling in a way more secure to go back into that interaction and be able to listen to what the other person has to say without feeling really threatened and needing to protect and defend yourself. The fourth one I'd say is to put yourself into a kind of growth mindset. This is this idea that you can grow in understanding. The other person can also change and grow in understanding. So believing the other person can change is helpful. But this kind of like emphasis on growth is something that we've learned helps people uh embrace intellectual humility. I imagine a lot of people who are parents if they're listening to this would would say like oh well intellectual humility that's something I definitely would want my kid to have. I am not a parent and I uh my heart goes out to all of you parents out there and it's a wonderful job and it's really really important. So how can you encourage this in kids as a parent? I will always go back to the kind of practice what you preach. So find ways to model it. Say you're asked a question and and you're not sure like try to model intellectual humility. I'm not sure. Maybe we can try to look it up together. So modeling is important. Celebrating intellectual humility. It's really hard for a kid to be vulnerable in certain settings and just be like, I was wrong. I got that wrong. I don't understand. I don't know. Like showing that to another person can be tough. So when that happens, that's a good thing to celebrate. Like, wow. Like, I'm really proud of you for doing that. So celebrating when your child has humility is really important. I don't know if you've studied this, but I wonder if there's also a a gender gap in uh intellectual humility because I certainly think that um a lot of the ideas of what it means to be a man have to do with this like decisiveness and certainty and not backing down. And I think that strict gender roles don't allow them to to grow or to be their full selves. It's a great point. And what we see is that on that kind of survey item, the boys are like, I don't want to show weakness and admitting you don't know something. They think it as a sign of weakness like it's not a good thing to do. So there definitely are gender dynamics working here. But what we also see when it comes to say like raising your hand to speak up in a class and say I don't understand that or I don't know what that is. when you're kind of showing that to the whole class and interrupting the class to take the class's time to do that, that's something that girls are much more hesitant about. We find in those studies that when the teacher has modeled that humility first, girls become a lot more comfortable voicing their own questions in that setting. And um that gap between boys and girls and how comfortable they are voicing their question closes. Yeah. It also makes me think that, you know, if you're non-binary or if you don't fit into the the spectrum, I I imagine that that actually requires a little bit more intellectual humility because, you know, you have to create some of your own path there. You have to be willing to imagine something that is outside of a yes or no. Um, and I wonder if that would actually require more intellectual humility as well. But also then I can see the other side, right? Like you also have to have this like definitive sense of like I I know this to be true about myself. And so I can see both ways. I I think all of these right there's there's always these competing tensions. Maybe it's very intellectually humble of you to see it both ways and this conversation is already taking effect. I like that. Um I think that you're right and I think some of these conversations around gender are asking us to take another look at these categories and I think there's real value in doing that. How would having more intellectual humility impact our society? How would it change the way that we live in our world if people across the board really embraced this and tried to cultivate this? I think we would learn more because we would begin to stop holding so tightly to what we think is true. So we might question and push the boundaries further which would allow allow us to progress. You know, right now we're going through a kind of trauma in the country. It's hard to even have a conversation with somebody who disagrees with you if we embrace intellectual humility. We find it's easier to get along and and love each other. Um Tamil, thank you so much for being on the show. Such a pleasure talking to you. Thank you so much. I'm really glad to have been here.",unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
noWh8SSeRCo,"""Shut it down."" That was the order given by angry students in response to a pro-Israel speaker. This is UC Berkeley, 2024, and pro-Palestinian students
were determined not to let this talk happen. A call to action went out on social media urging students to shut down the event, and nearly 200 students showed up. They attacked the venue, they broke down a door, they broke a window, and they forced the speaker to flee. Now I have defended the free speech
rights of literally thousands of students and their right to protest. But you do not have the right
to shut down someone else's talk and decide for everyone else
who they are allowed to hear. (Applause) That is mob censorship,
not freedom of speech. But unfortunately, 2023 and 2024 were the two
worst years for mob censorship and shout downs on record. Now to be clear, not all speech is protected,
nor should it be. There are certain categories
of speech acts, like incitement to violence, harassment and true threats
that aren't protected. Indeed, if there is such a thing
as a free speech absolutist, I have never met one. But I am an opinion absolutist. I believe that all opinions
should be protected, and your right to free speech
is a human right. But I also believe everyone's opinion
is crucial data to have about the world. But then again, I'm the weird law student who went to law school specifically
to study freedom of speech and the First Amendment. There was this one dude
who actually laughed at me that I would never
find a job in this field. Well, joke's on him. I've been doing this now for 25 years at the Foundation for Individual
Rights and Expression, FIRE. (Applause) And that 25 years
of experience has allowed me to see both how far students have fallen
from understanding freedom of speech, but also how principled and even joyful they used to be
in defense of free speech not very long ago. I think of West Virginia
University about 20 years ago. It was a lefty student group, and they were objecting
to a free-speech zone policy. Free speech zones is an Orwellian name for these policies that actually restrict and quarantine free speech
to little tiny corners of campus. They thought this was ridiculous, so they protested the zone
outside of the zone. And what would happen
is sometimes locals would walk by and they'd make fun of the students. They’d heckle them, they’d insult them. Want to know what
these students did in response? They cheered their hecklers. They believed --
and I love these students, I absolutely love them for this -- they understood that free speech
belongs to everyone or it belongs to no one. But unfortunately,
today, not just students, I feel like too many people believe
in something closer to freedom from speech rather than freedom of speech. But I'm not willing to accept that. I believe that there are four truths
that everyone needs to understand that can help get us back to understanding and appreciating free speech. And they are: one, free speech makes us safer. Two, free speech cures violence. Three, free speech protects the powerless. And four, even bad people
can have good ideas. So let's start. Free speech makes you safer. My mentor is a civil libertarian
named Harvey Silverglate, and he spent his career in part
defending freedom of speech, both on and off campus. But when the idea started to hit campus,
maybe back in the '80s, that bigoted or hurtful or hateful
speech had to be banned, he would say, ""I'd prefer to know
who the Nazis in the room are. So I know who not to turn my back to."" Now Harvey was right. It's about knowledge. Simply, you are not safer for knowing less about what people really think. (Applause) Gosh, you're making me blush. (Laughter) So I'll give you an example. And I hate to break this
to everyone here at TED, but lizard people, who live under the Denver airport, do not, in fact, control the world. (Laughter) They don't, I'm sorry. But knowing that your
future husband thinks they do or your congressman thinks they do or every single one
of your neighbors thinks they do is pretty important information to have. (Laughter) To understand the world,
you must know what people really think. Truth number two. Free speech cures violence. About half of Americans,
by some estimates more, believe that words can be violence. And this is especially true, it's actually much worse
on American college campuses. Ann Coulter, conservative, tried to speak at Cornell
a couple of years back, and her speech was also shouted down. And students actually literally shouted: ""Your words are violence."" Now I have experienced real violence. I was once punched out,
I was randomly assaulted. I got a concussion, and I couldn't see
out of this eye for a month. Worse, one of my friends
was stabbed in the chest. And I was there. It was right here. There was blood everywhere, and I was sure he was going to die. That's violence. And we insult the victims
of actual violence by equating words with bloody violence. (Applause) Free speech is not violence. It's the best alternative
to violence ever invented. Truth number three. Free speech protects the powerless. I fear, and I noticed this
about 15 years ago, that people were showing up on my radar, who seemed to have been taught
that free speech is a cynical tool of the three Bs: the bully, the bigot and the robber baron. Now this is just bad history. So historically, the robber baron,
the wealthy and powerful, have not needed a special
protection for free speech because they are wealthy and powerful. And historically, the bully and the bigot, in a democratic society,
if they have the votes, they still get to call the shots. You only need a special protection
for freedom of speech, like the First Amendment, for people who are either
unpopular with power or unpopular with the majority. This is why revolutionary figures
like Frederick Douglass, Ida B. Wells, Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela
all championed freedom of speech. It's why John Lewis,
someone I got to meet, actually, because he was in my neighborhood a lot, the great John Lewis, civil rights icon, he would argue, he would often say
that without freedom of speech, the civil rights movement
would have been a bird without wings. They understood that free speech
was not the weapon of the powerful. It is the best check
on power ever invented. Now, truth number four. (Applause) Even bad people can have good ideas. So much time is wasted
in social media debates -- I can just probably
end the sentence there -- (Laughter) But so much time is wasted
in social media debates trying to establish
that your opponent is a bad person. As if that's the same thing
as saying that they're wrong. Hopefully, by now we understand
that good people aren't always right, good people aren't always right, and bad people aren't always wrong. I mean, like it or not, people with truly awful beliefs
have made massive contributions. Take Wernher von Braun. Rocket scientist, got us to the Moon. Also Nazi. Or take Genghis Khan. Absolutely spectacular for trade routes. (Laughter) But ... Or take someone like Thomas Malthus, reportedly a kind and thoughtful man. But his ideas on overpopulation
actually were used to justify famines and mass sterilization. Or take another Thomas, Thomas More, great intellectual
and literal saint who also burned people. To death. But morality and accuracy
don't always line up. So I want you guys to do
a little exercise with me. This is participation time. Participation time. So please, look at your neighbor,
look at your neighbor, and repeat this after me. You're really getting into it, I love it. (Laughter) Repeat after me. Just because I hate your guts
doesn’t mean you’re wrong. (Laughter) Just because I hate your guts
doesn’t mean you’re wrong. Yes. Thank you so much. (Applause) OK, OK. I know nobody hates each other at TED. (Laughter) But it kind of points out how just labeling someone bad
is kind of meaningless. So, like, for that matter,
labeling someone, I don't know, like, woke or fascist
or libtard or grifter, it doesn't have anything to do
with whether or not they are right. The way we figure out truth
is a process of checking and rechecking, and it doesn't work if you just talk
to people you already agree with. (Applause) And think about the poster boy for questioning his society's
sacred cows and certainties. This is, of course, the great Socrates. He was so good at questioning
certainties and sacred cows that he angered his society so much they made him poison himself. To death. Socrates embodied the idea
that certainty is the mind killer. Young people used to be
the great drivers of free speech, and they can be again. But for that to happen, we all must remember
that to understand the world, it's crucial to know
what people really think. And that is only going
to happen in a situation in which people feel like
they can be their authentic selves. And for that, we need free speech. Thank you. (Applause and cheers)",unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FvKeHcpps1Y,"Do we have what it takes
to reach net zero? I don't mean this in a philosophical way. Does humanity have sufficient
grit and creativity? Do we have the political will? I mean, quite literally,
do we have enough stuff? Cement, steel, glass, nuts, bolts
needed to achieve net zero. Because this is no small undertaking. Over the next 30 years, we're going to need to build
42 billion solar panels, 1.3 million wind turbines, 476 nuclear reactors, establish a hydrogen economy, overhaul our electrical grid and transform our transportation networks. This is a lot of money
and a lot of labor, yes, but it's also just a lot of stuff. So as governments set increasingly
ambitious policy targets and businesses overhaul their operations, whether by carrots or sticks, we can't forget a fundamental question, is it even feasible? I've been working on climate and sustainability topics
my entire career. I started as a policy
advocate and activist lobbying for stronger 
policy interventions and later as a scientist and an engineer, only to come to the conclusion
that those industries, while very important, move so slowly. I'm not a very patient person and climate change demands urgent action. So I made my switch
to the business sector, where we have both the resources
and the agility to effect climate change on the necessary time scales. Among the highlights of my career has been working
at the BCG Henderson Institute, BCG's think tank. There, our research team studies
how to increase the speed and scale of the energy transition by looking at the transition
economy as a system. Underpinning our research is this idea that it's not just one sector
that's going to need to transform, but all of them. You know, it's not just wind
or automotive industries. These sectors are
transforming in parallel and we need to look at this holistically. So let me give you an example. If we wanted to answer this question,
can we achieve net zero, do we have enough stuff
for just the wind sector? Classically, you might
approach this question by looking at all the materials
you need to make a wind turbine and then comparing supply and demand. And what you would see
is that maybe through 2030 you'd see some scarcity in carbon fiber, possibly terbium, but it's really unclear
once you get to the bottom of the list. Once we start factoring in
the rest of the economy, the picture looks like this. There are 14 materials
that would face scarcity in the wind energy
supply chain through 2030 once we account for the full economy. I don't know about you, but I found
these results staggering. It's exactly this type of perspective
that we need to bring to policymakers to make informed decisions and to bring to investors so that they're investing
in clean technologies that will actually have meaningful impact. Now, you may be wondering, you know, isn't this just one scenario, right? There are many pathways
that you could take to reach net zero, and in fact, there are hundreds
of design choices that go into each of these
individual technologies. So to show you what I mean, we have a few different solar panels
here mounted in different ways. You can see this picture
on the bottom left uses cement. Some of the others do not. Whether they're mounted
on the rooftop or on the ground will influence things like the number
of inverters you need per gigawatt. So what happens if we start
factoring in actual design choices? Our team wanted to do this, so we ran a modest 6,000 experiments where we varied not only
the amount of solar and wind in our net zero scenario, but individual design choices. So for our solar panels, we looked at whether they were made
from crystalline silicon or thin films, whether they were framed in aluminum, whether they had a glass backing and whether they were mounted
on the roof or on the ground. And we varied similar parameters
for the wind sector. What we found was
that 45 percent of the materials needed to build solar and wind panels
could face scarcity through 2030 under every scenario we tested. Some of the materials we expected, right? Things like cobalt or rare earth metals
have been in the news for a long time, but others were a lot more surprising. No one's talking about aluminum
or carbon fiber. For every decarbonization pathway, the mix of technologies
down to small design choices can sway our ability to achieve net zero. And for businesses, what this necessarily means is that they're going
to look for substitutes as they try and overcome these scarcities. But those substitutes and those
transformations can lead to more scarcity. So ... We can do a thought experiment. Say we had a scarcity in carbon fiber. It's used to strengthen
the wind turbine blades. A logical substitute here is fiberglass. The fiberglass market is quite large, it could easily absorb additional demand
coming from the wind sector. But to make fiberglass, you need boron, and boron is becoming increasingly used
throughout the energy transition. It goes into rare earth magnets
that are used in EVs and wind turbines. It goes into boron steel
in the automotive industry, it goes into borosilicate glass
in certain types of solar applications. So as we increase demand for fiberglass, we may put strain on boron supplies. So maybe we just increase the supplies. Well, as it would turn out, there's only a few countries
that mine boron. Seventy-three percent
of known reserves exist in Turkey. And to open a new mine,
that's a 20-year process. So yeah, we could replace
carbon fiber with fiberglass, but it could have implications
for the entire economy. And this is just one material. For all of these technologies, there's hundreds, maybe even thousands
of components to consider. So ... I could give you another example, right. So if the wind example didn't resonate, we could talk about lithium ion batteries. They are skyrocketing in demand
driven by electric vehicles and grid scale storage. The anode material that goes
into a lithium ion battery is typically graphite. We would pretty much need to double
graphite supplies by 2030 to achieve net zero. The graphite anode
supply chain is dominated by China. They control 100 percent
of battery-grade graphite. So there are a lot of people looking
to expand supplies of graphite, but there's also substitutions
that are under research. Scientists are exploring the alternative
of using silicon as an anode material. But this not only creates a new
opportunity for silicon producers, but could put pressure in semiconductor
and solar panel industries. OK, thrown a lot at you, so just to check that you're following. Achieving net zero is going
to take a lot of stuff. That stuff is going
to increase our demand, could lead to scarcity and businesses will respond
through substitution. But there's one more thing
I'm not sure you caught. Somebody's going to get rich. That somebody could be you. (Laughter) For businesses big and small, the energy transition creates the single largest industrial
growth opportunity since the Industrial Revolution. The energy sector that was once
dominated by two fuels is now experiencing fierce competition among a broader range
of climate technologies. The materials and components
that go into these could gain a share
in trillion-dollar energy economy. And it's not just rare earth
metals and clean tech. We're talking about commodities. I mentioned aluminum a little bit earlier. This is an industry that has been
stagnant since the 1980s. But if we take our approach
to net zero seriously, they will see a boon in their industry. It's used in solar panel mounting
hardware and frames. It's used in conductors
for the electric grid. It's used to lightweight
electric vehicles. It can also replace other scarce
materials like copper, thereby seeing increased demand
through substitution. And it's not just aluminum, we're seeing this trend
for certain grades of steel, for silver, for epoxy resin. There's also opportunities
that exist by entering new markets. So we could say for an example, perhaps you are a manufacturer
of automotive parts. You may think that the electric
vehicle industry is going to be the death of your industry. But the same skills and labor that go into manufacturing
parts for a gas car translate incredibly well
to the wind energy sector, where wind turbines require
thousands of mechanical parts. Getting a foothold in that supply chain
could diversify your product portfolio and lead to new revenue opportunities. Or say you make lubricant. There's an opportunity for you, too. There's two drivetrains
that are common in wind turbines. One uses magnets that are becoming
increasingly rare, and one is mechanical design. As rare earth magnets become more scarce, the industry will likely shift
to mechanical alternatives, which will need more lubricant. We'll also see an expansion
in infrastructure. The offshore wind industry
is going to need ports that can store enormous components. It's going to need ships that can erect
skyscraper-sized wind turbines in the ocean. Those ships are going to need new engines that can burn alternative fuels
like methanol and ammonia. In fact, ammonia demand
is expected to double through 2030 and triple by 2050. That extra ammonia is going
to need storage. So if you're a chemical
storage tank producer, this is an opportunity for you too. And I haven't even touched the surface
on the finance sector, the education sector,
construction, logistic services that are all going to experience
increased opportunities as we achieve net zero. Now, I think it's important
to take a pause here to note, I'm not advocating for more consumption
on our pathway to net zero. And I think it's really
important to acknowledge that clean technologies can come with their own environmental
and social costs. We're going to need to be really
thoughtful about how we do this. But these opportunities
can also lead to innovations in new and different ways, right? Better processes, better use
and recycling of materials. The LED light bulb is a really
good example here. This is a technology
that reduces our energy use, but also saves consumers money and uses a fraction of the materials that go into a CFL
or an incandescent bulb. Achieving net zero
is not going to be easy. The timelines are incredibly tight, and given the complexity involved, it's going to require collaboration from both the public
and the private sectors. But this also provides an opportunity for innovation and for growth. I mentioned at the beginning of my talk that I am interested
in the business sector. I really do believe that this is where we are going to see
solutions to climate change happen. I want you to get rich
and to innovate and to grow, because this is how we reach
the speed and scale we need to achieve the energy transition. After all, someone has to make the stuff
needed for net zero. So I'll leave you with one final question. What opportunities lie ahead? Thank you.

MeWAG1QH5sg,"Hello and welcome TED members. I am Elise Hugh, the host of TED Talks Daily and I'm so glad to be with you today for the latest edition of the TED Talks Daily Book Club. Along with this live event, this is a special series on the TED Talks Daily podcast, a show where we deliver ideas that inspire daily. Lastly, we want to note that there will be mentions of violence and sexual assault in this conversation, so feel free to mute or leave the conversation when you need to. On June 14th, 1957, only 19 days after he was appointed president of Haiti, Daniel Fininole and his wife were kidnapped by Haitian soldiers and smuggled out of the country, all as part of a coup that had the full support of the US Eisenhower administration. Their seven children were taken from their home and held captive in the famed Deselene barracks in Porta Prince. The children were eventually smuggled out by their aunt who with the help of Catholic nuns managed to get them to the Dominican Republic and then onto a plane to reunite with their parents in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. The immense trauma and violence that the fenoles experienced and that followed them to the US scarred the family for life. Today's guest, Rich Benjamin, is an American cultural critic, anthropologist, and author. In 2015, he gave a popular TED talk about the time he embedded himself in some of the whitest communities in America for his book, Searching for Whittopia: An Improbable Journey to the Heart of White America. Rich is also Danielle Fininole's son, Daniel's grandson, and grew up in the shadow of this family history while knowing almost nothing about it. It was only after a fateful trip to Haiti in 2010 that Rich decided it was time to explore the history that helped shape him and uncover the stories his mother never felt able to share with him. His new memoir, Talk to Me: Lessons from a Family Forged by History, is the culmination of a 12-year deep dive into the family past, telling the stories of Haiti, the US, and what it was like to grow up as a black gay immigrant in this country, all while living under the shadow of this incredible history. Rich Benjamin, welcome. Thank you so much for opening your heart and sharing the story and for being with us today. Good to see you, Elise. Good to see you, TED community. We're happy you are here. So, let's just jump in and begin where the book starts. In your prologue, you share a story from about 15 years ago or more. You and your boyfriend at the time were in a taxi in Manhattan. You know this scene. The driver hears that you have an accent of some kind, and he wonders if you are also of Haitian descent like him. He keeps asking you where you're from, and you keep saying New York. So, why didn't you tell him that you were Haitian? And why did you choose to feature this particular story so early on? Well, Elise, in that moment, I was having one of these bougie Manhattan nights. We just been to the Philarmonic. We hop in a taxi and the dark-kinned driver says, ""Uh, do you have a Haitian accent?"" And then, ""Where are you from?"" ""I'm from New York."" ""Really? Where were you born?"" ""New York. Where did you originate from? New York. And so I didn't want to tell him I was I had Haitian blood because I was so far from Haiti in that moment. And Haiti has this really bad caricature in this country, one that I grew up with. Haiti is dysfunctional. Haiti is riddled with AIDS. Haitians are all boat people. All these negative stereotypes. And the punchline of that scene, and I won't reveal too much, is when my the guy I was seeing at the time says, ""Oh, I had a Haitian nanny, but I can't even remember her name."" So, there were all these stereotypes that Haitians are on the one hand resilient, but also unsavable. reading your book, I really related to that overall idea of discovering your own family's incredible history in just bits and pieces just all the way into adulthood because our elders often don't like talking about it, right? Um they say something so unexpected about the past at the dinner table and you're like what? Um and it's common knowledge to them but you can't believe you went your whole life not knowing about it. So, how much did you know before you started this book? And why, looking back, do you feel like your mother couldn't share this with you? Uh, well, first of all, Elise, I relate to that because I have friends of all kinds of background. They can have um a Chinese background, they can have a Jamaican background, they can have a Jewish background, uh they can have a Congalles background, and their parents just don't talk about the past, right? So, I hope people read this book and and identify with that aspect of family members just not wanting to talk about the past. But in my case, uh my mother was just silent about it. And in fairness to her, I also didn't ask because of the negative caricatures of Haiti I had internalized in my head. So, no one's talking about it. She's not telling me and I'm not asking until of course the Haitian earthquake in 2010 made asking made not asking impossible. And you also tell the stories of people in this book so intimately, you know, as we're reading this and it really often feels like you're painting these scenes where we feel like we're in the room while we're reading. So, how did you piece all of this together starting from very little knowledge to just deep intimate scenes? Um, thank you for saying that, Elise. I appreciate that. So, there's this big record for me in order to paint these intimate scenes. And that record includes uh letters from family members. It includes what I would find are news reports. It includes CIA records. And that was part of my journey of discovery was to find out that there's this big archive of records where the CIA operatives in Porter Prince were spying on my grandfather. So I'm able to construct the pass by that. And also I'm a bit of a packrat. If you've ever written me in my life, I've kept that letter that you've written me. So I have a lifetime of letters that I can draw on that uh were written to me. So all of these uh help construct the past, but it's also a matter of soothing. Uh one of the records that I got my hands on that really spoke to me and that I would never expect to find was this letter where my grandfather wrote the chief of police in Porter Prince begging for better protection for his family. And in order to beg for that better protection, he described the violence that they were living under. And it's just this graphic letter of empty kel chasings in his living room. It's this graphic letter of broken windows and how his children had to learn to hit the floor in seconds in order to not get hit. So, it's it's all these personal and public records that I'm able to draw on to just paint these intimate lives. And let's dive in a little bit more to your grandfather because publicly he became a deeply beloved hero in Haiti uh known for fighting relentlessly for the betterment of Haitians really until the day he died. But privately, a different picture emerges. He was a distant father and husband. He became more and more abusive to his children and wife throughout his life. uh before fully abandoning his family years later in Brooklyn to live with a much younger woman. So, I'm curious, Rich, how did you navigate these very different sides, public and private, of your grandfather? And that's incredible. It's kind of speaks to your last question, Elise, is how do you tell the past? So I can tell the past of his public life, you know, through all these public documents and then interviewing people who knew him. But his private life, that's one of the layers of secrets I was not aware of that in public he was this beloved figure who did all these measurable good things for children across Haiti and then he practically abandoned the ch. He not practically, he actually abandoned the children under his roof. And I could get a paint a picture of how he was as a human being in private behind closed doors. And so Elise, there's this beautiful phrase where a journalist in Haiti during his lifetime, they called him the Moses of Porta Prince. He had done so well, but then he was kind of a monster in his own home. How did you reconcile that? It's difficult to reconcile. It's difficult to reconcile except to say that he grew up under such and I'm not excusing it by any means, but he grew up under such hardship and violence. People don't realize that, and this is another really tactile portrait I like to print, is what was it like to grow up as a young black boy under the colonial power of America? Most people don't realize that America colonized through gunboats Haiti from 1915 to 1934. And what was that like? Not abstractly, not historically, but daytoday. What was that like to grow up under colonialism the way that my grandfather did? So, in reconciling the public Moses of Porter Prince with a private monster at home, I have to really put him in his context and try and walk in his shoes. Yeah. Let's talk to your or let's turn to your mother because when your mother was held captive after her father, your grandfather was removed from office, she Haitian soldiers raped her and it was a horrible and violent event that really shaped the entire trajectory of her life and yours too. Even if you write that you didn't always know that. She said she told her father what the soldiers did when they were captured and that he didn't believe her. She said she could never forgive him for this and it's one of the reasons she ended cutting ended up cutting him out of her life altogether. A generation removed now. How do you view this idea of forgiveness in theory and in practice? Right. It's for me and again I have to go on interviews with people who know my mother well. I have to go on letters she's written me. I have to go on my experience with her and I would assume at first that she would not forgive her father for the fact that he left the family for a younger woman but the book argues she doesn't forgive her for that deeper reason because at least as children we expect our parents to protect us like deep down at our core we expect our parents protect her to protect us and he failed to protect her and I doubt she ever forgave him for that. And that that's part of the layers of secrets. And the final thing I'll say on that matter is what I didn't know is why my mother chose the career she chose. So here I am boopping around my life and my mother is she's working abroad. She's working for UNICEF. She's working on behalf of young girls. Yeah. and she's literally working against the sexual assault and violence faced by young girls around the world. And in my research, I recover this beautiful article of an interview she gave to Self magazine in 1997, and she's talking about her work on behalf of young girls, but she never mentions that incident. So that's another revelation of secrets is part of her chosen career to protect young girls is because of this unknown violent occurrence that happened to her as a young girl. So it's it's woven into the layers of of discovery in the book. Do you think that she might have been more effective or even more effective in her work had she brought her own story um of sexual assault to the kind of communities that she was trying to connect with? Uh I don't think so. I think that's our generation as Americans at least to kind of say because I've been through this I know better this level of empathy which is a good thing. But I think for her generation, it was more important just to be an expert and to be effective and it didn't matter so much whether she connected with people personally. Yeah, that totally makes sense. You say that this book is a love letter of sorts to your mom. What does that mean to you? And now that the book is done, has your relationship with your mother changed? one really goes on this discovery at one something that I hope is a political pot boiler. This happens, this happens, this happens, this secrets revealed, this secret's revealed. I I I want the book to read quickly and beautifully and then at the end you realize, oh, it's about layers of family forgiveness and it's a form of love letters. Yeah, you look at the history of books, there are different forms of love letters in literature. And so this is kind of a social political one of discovery. Okay, let's get back to the politics and talk about Papa Doc or Francois Devalier uh who was later known as Papa Doc, the brutal dictator who ruled Haiti from 1957 until he died in 1971. He was behind the coup that ousted your grandfather from the presidency. And ironically, at one time he was your grandfather's friend and even your mother's godfather. Um, but obviously they turned from friends to foes. And based on your research, it seems clear that President Dwight Eisenhower's administration supported Dvalier's uh coup. So, can you speak to this takeover and why the US didn't like your grandfather? So before being president of Haiti, my grandfather was a labor leader in that country. And we have to imagine people are working their butts off to callull the sugar cane, to cut the sugar cane, to work in shoe factories. They're doing all this difficult work, but they have no representation to these big American corporations. And so my grandfather is their representative as a powerful union broker and he's able to get garner them better wages. He's better he's able to get them better working conditions. And so the corporate heavies across the world do not like him. And so the very day after he's inaugurated the Eisenhower administration is meeting. Dwight Eisenhower is presiding over the meeting. and you have the CIA director, you have the defense uh secretary, you have the secretary of state, and they decide not to recognize my grandfather's administration. And in the subsequent four days, they're fielding all these angry phone calls from US executives. And one of the most chilling phrases I remember is one of these executives telling the Eisenhower administration that Finle is quote our number one enemy and he should not be allowed to uh stay in office. And so lo and behold, just 19 days after his inauguration, he's ousted in a coup at the behest of the US government and the private sector. It sounds like corporations. Yeah, exactly. I'd love to talk about your trip to Haiti in 2010, the first time you ever traveled to Haiti, and you went right after the devastating earthquake which killed more than 200,000 people, destroyed much of Porta Prince and the surrounding area. Can you talk with us a little bit just about the connection between that trip and then your desire to write this book? So I, as I said, I had grown up very indifferent to Haiti. My mother's not talking about the Haitian past, but I had just finished my first book, Searching for White Topia. And then I was leaving my office in Manhattan at the time and that's when these images struck the flat screen TV in the lobby and an earthquake, devastating earthquake that destroyed 80% of a of porter prince had just happened. And you see these Haitian faces pleading. You see these devastated Asian faces, but you also see the presidential palace crumpled, the balres, the columns, the crown of the building just crumpled into dust. And at that point, ignoring Haiti, ignoring the Haitian blood coursing through my veins, it just became untenable. I had to know, who is this man who once occupied this building? And so I packed my bags and set off for Haiti. In or among all of that rubble are some of the Haitian archives that you hope to find on your trip. You mentioned you had to turn to the US archives for some information to piece together about the past. And it took years to declassify US state documents. You even had to sue the US government in order to access a lot of the files that you were looking for. So yes, where my mother wouldn't speak, where there was no information in some of the Haitian archives, I decided to turn to our archives and I hit what every writer wants, which is this gold mine of information. And those are the CIA records spying on my grandfather. And four of those documents is four of those documents were still redacted. They were just blacked out by Sharpie. So, I had to sue uh the State Department and uh for four I had to appeal their refusal to release the information and then I had to appeal three more times in federal district court to get that information revealed and so most of it has been revealed. So today, given the climate that we're in, how are you grappling with your own relationship with the US and the power of the US as a state? Yeah. Boy, what a great question. I never imagined when I began this book in 2010 really. Yeah. That all of its messages spoken and unspoken would really resonate with me now. And by that I mean the way that history can kind of break and open lives. And that's what I hope readers take from this book. I hope one of the messages beside the messages about families, about mothers, about love. I hope readers take from this book what happens when history arrives and kind of just yanks the sidewalk from underneath your feet. So, I hope readers are paying attention. And Elise, I really like the subtitle of this book, which I didn't come up with. I can't take credit for it, but lessons from a family forged by history. As I speak to you, history is forging us. Yeah. And we have the ability to forge history. You know, with all the horror that's going on in the world, I don't want readers to be these passive victims and say, ""Oh, well, that's the way things are."" No, we are active agents in history. We can forge history in the same way that history is forging us. And please, in this moment, as I speak, that we do not become passive sleepwalkers in history. Yeah. Yeah. such a vital message based on your work, including your first book, Searching for Whtopia. You like to put yourself in situations where people don't necessarily agree with you. You were on Fox News as a progressive commentator, something you chose to do for years. Uh can you speak briefly about why you felt it's important to do this to go into these spaces and to work in an environment where you know that people don't generally agree with your positions. Yes. It's one of the through lines from me to my grandfather and I don't want to self arrandise. He obviously did more for more people. He was obviously in more violent situations, but the through line is to put yourself out of a comfort zone, to not believe in safe spaces, and to do better in that lack of comfort. And so yes, for some years, I would say beginning around 2020 2007, I used to go on Fox News as a regular progressive commentator because the calculation was there was a sliver of reasonable, rational Fox News viewers who you could persuade about crucial issues like regulating Wall Street, like police brutality, like raising the minimum wage. So that's why I decided to go on Fox News. But I could tell I gave a good interview with Bill O'Reilly and some of these prime time hosts. Yeah. When afterward my inbox would just blow up and I knew that I had gotten under their skin and I was being persuasive. So yeah, I used to do that. I would never go on Fox News now because now everybody on that network is lying and they're not operating in good faith. Yeah. There's no pretense of trying to have a discourse in the same way that existed in 2007. It is a obviously a very different environment that we are in today. And knowing all of this reminds me of something your mother taught you, which is this notion that education is not meant to be safe. Yeah. Can you speak a little bit more to this and how she viewed it and how it kind of continues on in your work? So my grandfather was also a professor in addition to a labor leader. And as a professor, he would criticize the despotic regime at the time. And for that criticism, he would be tossed into prison. His home would be teargassed and sometimes worse. And so as a professor, his life was un was often in danger. But I like to think more spiritually and more in terms of books is he liked dangerous ideas. So, not only was he reading Shakespeare and Dro and the big philosophers of the enlightenment, he was reading pro black Haitian literature which was considered to be dangerous in that moment. So I think that lesson seeped down to my mother is that even if education isn't literally dangerous as was the case with my grandfather, it's meant to be spiritually, intellectually, and politically dangerous. Okay. In your TED talk, you talk about your research for Wtopia and how you learned firsthand about how emotionally charged the topic of immigration is and what a hot debate it would become. That was back in 2015. Um, now in 2025, that statement about immigration being a hot debate is obviously still incredibly true. So can you expand on what you meant in your talk and how your notion of immigration and the heat on this topic has changed for you through the writing of talk to me given the political landscape as of 2006 really I began a 27,000mi 2-year journey to the fastest growing and widest places in America and I packed my bags. There was a lot of recreational activity, golf, fishing, poker, and that bowling, uh that kind of thing. But one thing that caught me off guard in this journey beginning back as of 2007 is the deep antipathy in the actual country to immigration that wasn't registering in Washington. So for me, the most powerful of many examples of this was when I was in onetopia called St. George, Utah, and there was a citizens council against illegal immigration. That's their words. And these members would meet every week describing their stances against immigration. And there were lies spread about Ecuadorians and El Salvadorian gangs. And it was always this nostalgic idea that the California I grew up in, the Seattle I grew up in, the San Antonio I grew up in is gone and now I have to be in a wider place. And so immigration was a hot issue. And I noticed this real divide between people's actual not people's actual thoughts on immigration and what was happening in Washington. And the final thing I'll say about this is even back then I could tell the Democrats had a tin ear on this issue and they had no humane effective narrative about immigration let alone a solution. What would be a more affirmative vision or affirmative path forward um on this topic that you feel like maybe both parties are not quite grasping? At the time I said Democrats, you have to do two things. You have to have a realistic humane solution that is fair to immigrants but realizes that people who are actually dealing with immigration are having two different experiences. Right? In other words, they're are Democratic politicians. They've never been to a DMV. They're not sending their kids to public school. They're not using public parks. And so they don't understand these gripes, real and unreal, that are being made up about immigration. And so searching for whiteia way back in the day said that Democrats should stop waiting, should stop hemming and hawing, and they should thread that needle. But now 2025, we know what the result is. What are the big ways that you feel like the US political landscape has changed since you wrote um in your research or your the time that you wrote uh Whittopia? And and is there any way back to nuance and um a humane path forward? Elise, not only would I like nuance, I would like basic safety. When I went to Cordelane, Idaho, for example, I crashed a retreat of white separatists and supremacists. I would never do that now. So, one of the ways life has changes is not only the lack of lu nuance, but the lack of basic safety. I would never go into the heart of Magaland now in 2025 in the way that I was perfectly comfortable to do so in 2006. And so just the violence, the rhetoric, the lies, the stupidity, frankly, that's the huge change. I I I you know, I have a dear older twin sister you'll trust with anything. And there was one time in two years I felt even remotely out of danger. And I said to her, ""If you don't hear from me by this hour, just text me. But now I I don't think what I did would be say would be particularly safe for me now."" Oh my gosh. We touched on colonialism earlier in this conversation and imperialism. And throughout your book, you explore the really deep roots of that colonialism and imperialism have in current affairs both in the US and globally. Um, there's so few of us who haven't been touched by it one way or the other. So, can you see how it takes form in the racist and xenophobic attitudes and stereotypes against groups like Haitians? Really attitudes that played a role in the 2024 election, which we didn't even really talk about yet. um and that continue to shape public policy today. I really feel like this book is a testament to the truth um and reality of intersectionality and how maybe everything is really more connected than it seems and that we don't all exist in vacuums and on islands. So reflecting on the past, what do you feel like you've learned that feels relevant to this current moment? Um and then maybe you can weave in what you want people to take from this book given what you've learned. Thank you for pointing that out. The way that in your words, we're all touched by colonialism because I think many people don't realize that. And that is really an undercurrent in this book is how we are all touched by colonialism. Even if our grandfathers were never president of a colonial country, we are all touched by colonialism. And for me, the horrifying resonance of that today is when Trump starts spewing his nonsense about Haitian immigrants eating pets. When Trump starts spewing his nonsense that we have the right to retake the Panama Canal, when Trump starts spewing his nonsense about Greenland, it's based in a colonial expansionist mentality, and the fancy word for that is American exceptionalism, where this country is so exceptional and so good that we have the right to behave any dastardly way we please. that might makes right. And so in all our domestic lies and in the foreign policy that we're facing today, colonialism is rearing its head in an ugly way again. And it's all of our problem as you point out. Yeah. Rich, one last question from me before we move on to questions from the audience. Is there a particular part of the book that you enjoyed writing the most? Um or a quick, you know, line or two that you want to share with us. We want to leave enough time for uh for audience questions. Of course, the most difficult part of the books to write had to do with my mother because it's parts of it parts of it are wonderful and triumphant and she's resilient. But to answer your question, the part I loved writing the most is, and this has to do with sleuth work, right? My grandfather's life, moving through the world as a young man, moving through the world as a young professor, falling in love with my grandmother. For me, those were the best, funnest parts to write. Very cool. Okay, we have so many member questions already queued up for you. So, are you ready to dive in? I'm ready. Okay. From Benji W. How has your experience as a black American of Haitian descent started to change since finishing and publishing this book? What would the epilogue be if you wrote one? It it's changed to more pride. And one incident for me that really captured that is I was signing books at the New York Public Library and a woman who appeared to be in about her 60s Yeah. said, ""Hello, my name is Danielle."" And the reason my name is Danielle is uh I my mother was pregnant as your grandfather was running for president in 1957. And my mother was such a fan of him that she named me after him. And to see the that woman all these years later in New York City at a book signing, that's how my attitude has changed. It was a really special kind of shocking moment. Yeah. So touching from Victoria K. In your research, did you come across historical narratives that were distorted or left out entirely? And how can we ensure a fuller more inclusive telling of history? Yes. Yes. Yes. You know mainstream often white historians will say, ""Oh, the Kako rebellion ended in 1920."" But if you ask a actual Haitians, they say the rebellion went on well into the 1920s. So that's a concrete example of two differences of history and how mainstream establishment historians will write history one way but the people who actually lived it have a better more nuance version of history. And so the book has to reconcile their version also. And how do we ensure a more fuller fuller or a more full and um inclusive account? We have to write our own books. We have to write our own books. Yeah. I I believe that honestly. I'm not trying to be glib. Is that if there is a story that hasn't been written, a through line, a history, a narrative that hasn't been written, we must be the ones to write it. Okay. From uh Tor R. As a cultural critic, what role do you think storytelling plays in addressing societal divisions? Indispensable. I think the role of storytelling is indispensable. Stories are memorable. Stories are healing. Stories are powerful. And stories speak to each other. You know, statistics don't relate us. But I hope when people buy this book, the stories, even if you have no Haitian blood, if you've ne never been anywhere New York City, if you've been anywhere near the Western Hemisphere, I still hope the stories speak to you. So stories are indispensable. Yeah, that's a great message to our very global TED audience. As you know, we are quite global. Um, next question is from Ketakandriana R. She says, ""Where do you get your inspiration from, Rich? Do you think AI will break humanity's ability to write stories? And if that's possible, what can we do to avoid that?"" Yeah. So, I get my inspiration from other art and from other artists in my community. And in these digital technology days, I recommend that people have a real life close creative community. And more specifically, you know, I have a sculptor in my community. I have other writers in my community. I have musicians and painters. And their creativity kind of shakes my head loose. uh provokes new ideas, provokes new ways of thinking of something. So if I hear a beautiful tune, it helps me to think about words better. If I see a beautiful sculpture, it helps me to think about words better. So that's what works for me personally. That's what inspires me is the creativity and the successes of others. And AI in my belief is horribly detrimental to this. And I'm not one of these anti- AI lites, but for me, the problem with AI is that it's so passive. It's so passive. And for me to have a creative life, a creative mind is I have to be very proactive in seeking the friendships and the community that really get my brain synapses sparking. Yeah, that's such a reminder, powerful reminder to really nurture our creative communities. No matter what kind of work you're making, what would you say to people who are leaving their countries and cultures behind? There continues to be so much migration across the world. Yeah, it's it's it's it's a fascinating issue. uh you know the migration into Europe, the migration into the Middle East, from Asia, the migration into America, from Central America. You know for me it means if you intend to stay in the country deeply learning the language deeply learning the culture deeply understanding the culture while never ever again being bullied into dismissing or looking down upon the culture that you left which has been the case for most of our history in America. Yeah. A demand for assimilation. A demand for assimilation. But not only a demand for assimilation, but this hierarchy as to who's better, who's not, between Americans and immigrants and even among immigrants. And that's been the whole history of Haiti, you know, oh, Haiti is a sight of the AIDS epidemic. Oh, Haiti is boat people. Oh, Haiti is violent. Oh, Haitians are into Haitian is a superstitious voodoo culture strictly on and on and on. So that's my advice. Ariana asks, ""How do you honor your story when it's been really painful and you might want to change your reality?"" I don't know if Ariana literally means my story, but if she does, it's the same answer I would have for her story is I don't think of this as a trauma narrative as at all. I mean, they're funny scenes and what I land on without giving away the conclusion or anything is this is a book about survivors. It's a book about people who are resilient who thrown into this context really make a way out of now wa",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
. And for me an example of that is my mother's choice of profession is that she had this experience and then she professionally she became this type of human being. So, it's to acknowledge to look for the examples of survival and resilience and joy that exist in all of our stories. That's lovely. All right, before we wrap, Rich Benjamin, I wonder if we could end with you reading a short passage that you wrote at the end of your first chapter. So, the Do you mind opening up to the first chapter and reading the last two sentences? Okay, I could read those. Great. Talk to me. Lessons from a family forged by history. As my mother ages, I worry I am squandering a vanishing chance to really know her, our history. My family's existence in Haiti, those disremembered years, dwell like a curora in our minds. Lost stanzas in an epic poem. If ever I am to understand my mother, I must speak to that void. Beautiful passage and I really feel like your book has spoken to that void in a beautiful and powerful way, Rich. Thank you so much for writing it and for being with us today. Thank you, Elise. Thank you, everybody. Thank you for uh taking your time. I know there's a million things you could have been doing today," so I'm really grateful that you're here with us.""",unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ztx0Bch3h9s,"Thank you very much for the warm welcome. It’s been 10 years
since the Paris Agreement. And every single nation in the world, 195 nations, agreed to try
to get to net zero by mid-century. And let me deal
with the elephant in the room. One nation, only one, has begun
the process of withdrawing, and the Trump administration
has also canceled executive orders, withdrawn from international
climate organizations. They have declared
a so-called energy emergency in order to promote fossil fuels. They’ve phased out
government support for clean energy. But bear this in mind. During the first Trump four-year term, investments in the energy
transition doubled. We have seen solar capacity
more than double. Electric vehicle sales have doubled. Wind energy went up by almost 50 percent during his first term. And we are seeing that 60 percent,
during his first four years, of new energy came from renewable energy, and coal investments
went down almost 20 percent. So there's good news and there's bad news. A lot’s happened in the last 10 years. But I want to ask this question. The fossil fuel industry wants
to ignore the amazing good news. And they are labeling the commitments
that the world made at the Paris negotiations as a fantasy. And they're calling
for an abandonment of the efforts to reduce the fossil fuel burning. And they’re now advocating a new approach
that they call “climate realism.” Well, climate realism, according to them, we should abandon the efforts
to deal with the principal cause of the climate crisis, eighty percent of it comes
from burning fossil fuels, and we should focus on adaptation
as well, almost exclusively. Well, we need adaptation. A lot of people are suffering, but do we want to vastly increase
the number of people that have to go through
that hardship and suffering, instead of dealing
with the cause of the crisis and solving the climate crisis? According to climate
realism, historically, the energy transitions
have taken place very slowly, so we have no right
as human beings to even imagine that we could go faster in the future than what history has told us
was the reality in the past. Even though human
civilization is at stake. For the so-called climate realists, the goal of solving the climate crisis is way less important than other goals, such as, especially, increasing
energy access to developing countries, which is obviously important,
we'll deal with that. But they want to do it obviously
by burning more fossil fuels. According to climate realism, it's just not practical to stop
using the sky as an open sewer for the emissions from burning
fossil fuels and the other emissions. Instead, we should just continue
using the sky as an open sewer. So where climate realism is concerned, I have some questions. Is it realistic to ignore the one
to two billion climate refugees that the climate scientists are warning us will cross international borders and have to move inside
their own nations by 2050 because of the climate crisis? You know, the temperatures keep going up. 10 hottest years were the last 10. Last year, 2024, was the hottest
year in all of history. Yesterday in parts of the Persian Gulf, 52.6 degrees. And for those of us who use
Fahrenheit, 126.7 degrees. A few days ago in Pakistan, 50.5 degrees. That's 122.9 in Fahrenheit. And they're telling us
that as the temperatures go up and the humidity goes up, the few areas in the world today that are labeled physiologically
unlivable for human beings are due to expand
quite dramatically by 2070, unless we act to cover all of these vast,
heavily populated areas. Is it realistic to ignore this crisis? Look at what a few million
climate refugees have done to promote authoritarianism
and ultranationalism. How can we handle one
to two billion in the next 25 years? Already here in Kenya,
there are 800,000 refugees, 300,000 of them in this place
where, of course, the USAID cuts are now
cutting the food aid 70 percent. Is that what they mean by adaptation? We have to also ask if it's realistic to ignore the devastating damage
predicted to the global economy. Whole regions of the world
are becoming uninsurable. We see this in my country where people
are having their insurance canceled. They can't get it renewed. We have seen predictions that we could lose 25 trillion dollars
in the next 25 years, just from the loss of the value
of global housing properties. And over the next half century,
according to Deloitte, it would cost the economy
178 trillion dollars if we don't act. But if we do act, we can add to the global
economy by 43 trillion dollars. You know, I had a teacher who said
we face the same choice in life over and over again. The choice between
the hard right and the easy wrong. It seems hard to choose correctly, but it would turn out to be even harder
to take what looks like the easy wrong. Is it realistic to ignore
the fact that right now, Greenland is losing 30 million tons
of ice every single hour? In Antarctica, decade by decade,
the ice melting has accelerated. We've seen the doubling of the pace
of sea level rise in the last 20 years, and the predictions are that it's going
to continue dramatically. Is it realistic to ignore
the rapidly increasing climate crisis, extreme events that are occurring, practically every night
on the television news is like a nature hike
through the Book of Revelation. We lost 3.5 trillion dollars
just in the last decade. And you know, the fact that these scientists were absolutely
correct decades ago, when they predicted
these exact consequences should cause us to pay
a little more attention to what they're predicting
is in store for us in the years ahead, if we do not act. The drought last year and continuing, at some level, in the Amazon it’s
the worst drought in the history, of the Brazilian Amazon. 90 percent of the Amazon River
in Colombia went dry. This is the third year in a row that we've had these
massive fires in Canada. When I left Tennessee to fly over here, we were breathing in Nashville, Tennessee, smoke from the Canadian wildfires. And they're still getting worse today. The wildfires have doubled
over the last 20 years in frequency, and they're due to increase even more. Is it realistic to ignore the massive
health impacts of the climate crisis? You know, the World Health Organization has long told us it is the most
serious health threat facing humanity. Just last week,
the University of Manchester released a new study
warning that three species of fungi, in the next 15 years, because of increasing temperatures
and increasing precipitation, will pose a significant risk
of infection to millions of people. The fact that the fungi are being pushed into the range where
they can threaten humans, that is not a fiction. The particulate air pollution
from the burning of fossil fuels kills almost nine million people a year, costs almost three
trillion dollars per year from the burning of fossil fuels
for both energy and petrochemicals. Let me show you an example
from my country. “Cancer Alley” is the stretch
that runs from New Orleans to Baton Rouge, Louisiana. All these red plumes
are particulate pollution that people are breathing in. The green areas, by the way, are majority minority, mostly African-American areas. In the middle of Cancer Alley, Reserve, Louisiana has the highest
cancer rate in the United States, 50 times the national average, and they want to put even more
petrochemical facilities there. Is it realistic to totally ignore
the acidification of the world's oceans? 30 percent more acid
than before the Industrial Revolution, and 93 percent of all the heat
is being absorbed in the oceans. That's why the coral reefs
are in such danger. 84 percent are in danger right now. We've seen massive die offs. That's why a lot of the fish are at risk. 40 to 60 percent of all the fish
species face an extremely high risk, as the rivers and estuaries, where they have spawning and in their embryonic stages,
continue to heat up. And 50 percent of all living species
that we share this planet with are at risk of extinction. Is it realistic to ignore that? My faith tradition tells me that Noah was commanded
to save the species of this Earth. I think we have
a moral obligation as well. Is it realistic to ignore the predictions
of a fresh water scarcity crisis? Already, 40 percent
are facing water scarcities. In the mountain glaciers
here in the Himalayas, one quarter of the world's
population depends on that meltwater. But depending on whether or not we act, 80 percent of all those glaciers
will disappear in this century. We can act. Now this just happened in Switzerland: a 600-year-old city was completely
destroyed by glacial avalanche. Now they're adapting. Is this realistic? To put white sheets over
the remaining parts of the glacier? Well, God bless them, I hope it works, but these are the kinds
of extreme measures that people are being pushed to in order to avoid reducing
the burning of fossil fuels, because the fossil fuel industry
and their petrostate and financial allies
have control over policy. In lots of cities,
particularly in places like India, the water wells are going dry. In Bangalore, four million people now have to buy
expensive water trucked in because their wells have gone dry. What about the food crisis
that scientists are predicting? Is it realistic to ignore that as well, in order to avoid doing anything
to reduce fossil fuel emissions? Now why also do these
so-called climate realists ignore all the good news about the miraculous decline in the cost
of the alternatives to fossil fuel? Is it possibly because their
business models are threatened? If there is a cheaper, cleaner alternative that creates many more jobs, might not be good for them
the way they calculate it. But the rest of us have a stake in this. This could be why they've been
consistently wrong in their predictions in the past. For example, ExxonMobil,
in the year of the Paris Agreement, had a prediction about solar
capacity in 2040: 840 gigawatts. Well, this year we've already tripled
the number that they predicted for 15 years from now. (Applause) OPEC the same year predicted electric vehicle sales
would barely increase. Well, they were wrong. Here's what it is. Actual sales to date right now. Same year, OPEC predicted
that it was just unrealistic to think that solar power
would ever be able to compete in cost with the burning of fossil fuels, but now it is by far the cheapest source
of electricity in all of history. Now, you know, a lot of other people
have been surprised by how quickly these costs have come down. University of Oxford
studied 3,000 past projections, and the average predicted decline
was 2.6 percent a year. The reality was 15 percent per year. And when you compound a number like that, it makes quite a difference. Here are all the past projections
from the International Energy Agency of what solar energy was likely to do,
their projections year by year. And here is the reality
of what has actually happened. It really is quite extraordinary. (Applause) My goodness, nobody could have imagined
that it would be this incredible. But it is and it’s right before us,
and they still want to ignore it. Since 2015, the world's installed
twice as much solar as all fossil fuels combined. Solar is the breakout winner
in fuel sources. Electric vehicles
have increased 34 times over since the time of the Paris Agreement. Vehicle sales in China, 52 percent are already EVs and within five years, the prediction is 82 percent
of all car sales will be electric vehicles. Also, by the way, China in April installed
45 gigawatts of new solar capacity in one month. That's the equivalent of 45
brand new giant nuclear reactors in one month. It's actually incredible
what is happening, and the cost of all of these
clean-energy technologies has come down quite dramatically,
particularly solar. And even more dramatic is utility-scale
batteries, 87 percent down. That's making a huge difference as well. But I have to say this. There's one thing that the so-called
climate realists are right about. In spite of this progress, we are still moving too slowly
to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. We have got to accelerate it. We have the ability to do so. But the single biggest reason
we have not been able to move faster is the ferocious opposition
to virtually every policy proposal to try to speed up this transition and reduce the emissions
from the burning of fossil fuels. And the fossil fuel industry
has used a lot of bright, shiny objects to divert
the public's attention and deceive them
into thinking there are solutions other than reducing fossil fuel use. For example, carbon capture and storage and direct air capture
and the recycling of plastics. And, you know, they're much better
at capturing politicians than they are at capturing emissions. And they are employing -- (Applause) They're employing their captive
politicians and policymakers to help confuse the public. Here's an example. Tony Blair, speaking for his foundation, his foundation gets massive
funding from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Azerbaijan, etc. He said, “Oh, well, the center of the battle
has to be carbon capture and direct air capture."" Well, he really should know better. You know, Upton Sinclair wrote
in my country, years ago, ""It's difficult to get a man
to understand something if his income depends
on him not understanding it."" The income goes to the foundation,
as I understand it. But here is carbon capture. These are the ones operational. These are the ones
that have applied for permits. These are the ones that have had
the big public announcements. Oh, boy, look, we're going
for carbon capture. We don't have to reduce
the burning of fossil fuel. We'll capture it all
as it goes out the smokestack. It is a fraud. It is a deception imposed on the people in order to try to change policy and to make the policy what they want. And because they've captured
the politicians, they have been able to force the taxpayers
in countries around the world to subsidize fossil fuels. To actually subsidize the destruction
of humanity's future. What would happen if we got rid
of those subsidies? Well, the International Monetary Fund said that we would get
4.4 trillion dollars in savings, which happens to be just
about the exact amount we need to finance the transition
to renewable energy. That's where a lot
of the money can come from. We'd also save a lot of lives, and we'd also reduce emissions
by a third in five years, and we'd reduce income inequality. So is it realistic to ignore
this urgent need to reform the world's
financial infrastructure so that we can properly invest
in the climate crisis? Most of the financing
comes from private sources, but developing countries
are not getting their share of it. We need to reform the policies
that are leading to this, because 100 percent
of the increased emissions expected are going to come
from the developing countries. We're about to see
massive reductions in emissions. It may have already started, especially in China
with all their renewables, but the developing countries, that's where the emissions increases
are due to take place. And yet they only receive less
than 19 percent of the world's financing for clean energy, but almost 50 percent
of the money flooding in for more fossil fuels. The single US state of Florida
has more solar panels than the entire continent of Africa. That is a disgrace, because Africa has 60 percent
of the world's prime solar resources, yet only 1.6 percent of the financing
for renewable energy. But look at what's happening with the investments
for fossil fuels in Africa. There's a dash for gas. All of these new facilities, there are three times
as many fossil fuel pipelines under construction and proposed
for construction to begin in Africa as in all of North America. And you take those LNG terminals, the cost of one of them, there's 71 in the works,
31 already existing, 25 billion dollars. That's the exact amount that would provide
universal energy access to all of Africa. So maybe we could spend
that money a little bit better. But instead of financing actual
energy access to renewable energy, they want access to the resources
to export it from Africa instead of giving access for Africans. You know, the potential
for solar and wind in Africa is 400 times larger than the potential
energy from fossil fuels. Every single country in Africa could have 100 percent energy access using less than one percent of its land. Most, including the country we're in, less than 0.1 percent of their land. What else are they ignoring? Well, they're ignoring
that with solar and wind you don't face the fuel supply-chain risk, you don't face price volatility for fuel. Look at what's happening to energy, oil and gas soaring because
of the war in the Middle East. In fact, they don't have
an annual fuel cost at all. So we should be moving in this direction, not least because it creates
three times as many jobs for each dollar spent as compared to a dollar spent
on fossil fuels. Why do they also ignore the fact
that methane is as bad as coal when the leaks are factored in,
and the leaks are ubiquitous? And right now in the European Union, the fossil fuel lobbyists are arguing
as hard as they can to stop legislation to try to deal with methane leaks because they think
it’ll cost them some money. So what's really behind
this preposterous theory they call climate realism? Could it be that they're kind of
panicking a little bit about the loss of their markets? According to the IEA, all of the fossil fuels are projected
to peak within the next few years. We've seen, since the Paris Agreement,
a complete turnaround in where the majority
of investment is going, and emissions may have already peaked
in several of these sectors. And this is according
to the Climate TRACE, precise measurements of peaking. And a lot of these sectors are ones
that need even more attention: agriculture, steel, etc. But last year, if you look at all the new
electricity installed worldwide, 93 percent of it
was renewable, mostly solar. So, the IEA’s told us long since, we have all the technologies we need and proven deployment models to reduce emissions 50 percent
in this decade and clear line of sight
to the other 50 percent. A friend of mine in Tennessee said, ""If God wanted us
to have unlimited free energy, he'd have put a giant
fusion reactor in the sky."" Well, if you look at how long it took
to install a gigawatt of solar 20 years ago, a full year. Now it’s down to 15 hours,
and it’s on the way down still. So here's what I believe
that the so-called climate realists are most wrong about. They don't believe that we,
the people who live on this planet, have the capacity to make the changes
necessary to save our future. The greatest president
in my country's history, Abraham Lincoln,
said, “At a time of dire crisis, the occasion is piled high
with difficulty. We must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, we must think anew."" I believe that we as human beings have the capacity to recognize
that our survival is at stake, and that we need to move faster, even though the big polluters
have the political and economic power to try to block us. We've got everything we need. The people are demanding change. The one thing that they tell us
might be in short supply is political will. But always remember, political will is itself
a renewable resource. Let's get out there and renew it. Thank you, thank you very much.

1IAaKLAVysQ,"So a few years ago, I was facilitating a workshop inside of a level-three
men's prison right here in California. Oftentimes, we had about 70 participants. Men serving sentences
anywhere between three to 38 years. As we began our workshop, like any good workshop,
start with an activity. The activity that we started with
is known as Cross the Line. You might be familiar with it, but the way it works is I ask a question and if it resonates, then a participant steps forward
and cross the line. The question that I asked was to step forward and cross the line if you were currently serving a sentence for a crime that you committed
that took you 60 seconds or less. An overwhelming amount of participants
took a step forward. And not just one of the trainings,
but in every one of them. Wow. I was astonished. In less than 60 seconds, these men had lost
so many years of their lives. And they’ve also created victims, and they've impacted
their own families and communities. All because they couldn't pause and were most likely acting in alignment with what they think
it is to be a real man. See, I grew up right here in Inglewood, and Inglewood, like many cities
across the country, has been impacted by that invisible,
yet potent misconception of masculinity and what it means to be a real man. Culturally, we perpetuate this
through music, entertainment. All influencing how men
and boys view masculinity and what it means to be a real man. Now sadly, I’ve lost
too many of my own loved ones due to this misconception. Folks fueled by anger, jealousy
and a lack of self-accountability. It was the murder of my two
best friends and my cousin, Robert Gary Jackson Jr., Trayvon Williams, Tyrone Tucker Jr., that really propelled me to become
a healthy manhood and masculinity advocate and to go on to found
the Giant's Den leadership network for aspiring Black men and boys, where we foster
emotionally intelligent leaders who are also actively engaged
in their communities. But this ain't how it started. Before I was known for this work, before I found my passion
for supporting Black men and boys, I was known and celebrated
for my aggression on the football field and also known for these hands. I was the guy who wanted to fight once folks started making
one too many jokes. In fact, I often wanted to fight
whenever I felt disrespected, which is OK in my community. Because in my community it was OK, and it was celebrated
for young men to have short fuses and to be emotionally immature. I was taught that disrespect needed
to be responded to with violence. That's how real men dealt with it. And to walk away or try to talk through a situation
made you scared or weak and could lead to a shameful reputation. So I followed suit. When I was 20 years old, I took a two-hour drive
in the middle of the night to get into a fight because I had felt disrespected. But in my reflection, I recognized that it wasn't
disrespect that I was feeling. It was insecurity. Because two hours
is a long time to stay mad, you know what I mean? You have to really
be working at this mad stuff. So how does one sustain
anger for a two-hour ride? I'm telling myself one-sided stories that justify what I'm about to do. Adding fuel to my fire. Letting my anger boil because the narrative that I'm sharing is allowing me to feel like I'm justified. So I take this two-hour drive
in the middle of the night. I get into the fight, and I was doing what I thought
it meant to be a real man. But the consequences of that night actually led me
to a felony assault charge. A felony. And that wasn't the worst part. I wasn't able to see my daughter for the next three and a half years. Not because I was tough. I got a felony because
I had my feelings hurt, and I didn't have
the emotional management skills to respond differently at the time. See, our community doesn't teach men
and boys conflict resolution skills. In fact, when I came up, I learned conflict escalation skills, how to pop off. Right? And I understand all the things
that happened in our past and in the community and the world
that has led to these conditions and those valuable lessons
that weren't taught to many of us. But after bumping my head,
after doing my work, I've realized the importance of men
having actual emotional management skills. Having emotional management
skills not only to be a nice person but to avoid life-altering situations like going down that treacherous
path of mass incarceration, substance abuse, domestic violence, estranged family relationships, and statistically speaking, dying early. But I want to give some tools that could have been a game changer
for me in my situation. And if you're someone who is still
currently being impacted and influenced by that invisible yet potent
misconception of manhood and masculinity, hopefully it can help you to avoid some of these
life-altering situations as well. The first thing I recognize is -- I ask, guys, how are you doing? ""They say, I'm cool, straight. You know, another day."" Not often having the language
to pinpoint an actual emotion. So what you see up here
is the feelings wheel. You can Google this,
you can find it anywhere. But the feelings wheel
actually gives us some language to identify and pinpoint
where we might be in our emotions. I'll ask you how you're doing. Somebody might say, ""Oh,
this is what happened to me today."" That is a story,
and that is not a feeling, right? So wanting to really provide a tool so we can say, ""I'm feeling depressed,"" ""I'm feeling angry,"" ""I'm feeling happy,""
""I'm ecstatic,"" ""I'm overwhelmed."" There's a tool that was created by BEAM, which is the Black Emotional
and Mental Health collective that really helps with de-escalation. And this tool is a strategy
called P.A.U.S.E. Now P.A.U.S.E. is an acronym. And I'll break down each letter for you. And hopefully it sticks and it's something that you can share
with your communities as well. The first letter is P. Pay attention. Think about a time that you were angry. Might have been recently, might have been a while ago. But what were the type of thoughts
that consumed your mind? Were they positive, or were they negative? Most likely they were negative, which kind of sustains your anger. How was your body feeling? Were you tense in your shoulders? Were you forgetting
to take that deep breath? Was your heart rate sped up? These are all signs
that our bodies are sharing with us to let us know that we're
in an escalated state. What story, what narrative
are we sharing with ourselves? Because what we’re thinking
impacts how we’re feeling, and how we feel impact how we behave. But if we don't have the language
to identify how we're feeling, it can be hard to avoid that behavior
that can really shift our lives. So pay attention. The next one is to assess
what's actually activating you. What is this, was it a tone of voice? Do you feel like you weren't being heard? What is it that was said, done, what is it about the environment
that is activating you? You might call it a trigger. Do you know what your triggers are? Do you know the environments,
the people, the things that activate you? That's a great place to start. Because if we know what activates us, maybe we can avoid
those life-altering situations. The next letter is U. Understand. Understand the roots of our feelings. In my life, I recognized ... That there's a voice in my head
often judging me, telling me what to do, leading me. And somewhere along my journey, I recognized that that's not
actually my voice. So whose voice is it that's guiding you and your decisions? Is that a parent? Is that a teacher? Is it an older sibling? Is it a bully from third grade? What is the root of this feeling? Where is it coming from? What values of yours might feel like
they're being compromised in this moment? Because if we can identify the root, we can get to the actual cause of this and we're not so susceptible
to popping off. Alright? Next letter is S. Set boundaries, separate yourself, ensure safety. I know sometimes, I don't want to walk away,
we're going to handle this right now. I've never known that to be the best idea. To be calm, to be cool, to walk away into a safe environment so that you're ensuring
safety for everyone, that's what a real man does. It's not only about me sharing with you
how I'm feeling and what I'm doing and trying to convey my perspective, but it's also about ensuring safety
for everyone who's in this space. And that might mean stepping away
and coming back when cooler heads prevail. The last one is E. To empathize. How are other people experiencing me? What point were they trying to get across? How am I contributing
to escalating this entire situation? Because the truth of the matter is, when there's disagreements,
there's misunderstanding. And if we can just pause ... and try to consider what the other people
are trying to convey to us, it can avoid a lot
of those life-altering situations. Being a real man isn't
about dominating others. Being a real man isn't about ... proving to other folks
that we are what we naturally are. But a real man takes time to think
about the impacts of their decisions, to think about the folks
who are being impacted by their words, their thoughts, their behaviors. A real man takes a pause. Thank you.

Mq1S5gEztHE,"You're watching How to be a Better Human. I'm your host, Chris Duffy. And today on the show, we're talking about art and creativity. And one of the big things that I think is true about becoming an artist or making any sort of creative work is that you actually want to take from other people. You want to take inspiration from someone's style or from the way that they make work or what they make work about. You want to take all those things, steal them, put them together, blend them up, and create your own unique artistic voice. Now, that is an idea that I am stealing from the author and artist Austin Cleon. He wrote the book Steal Like an Artist, and I stole it from there. So, today on the show, what does it look like to steal like an artist? What does it mean to make work? And who gets to be an artist with Austin Cleon. Hi, I'm Austin Cleon. I call myself a writer who draws. I make uh art with words and books with pictures. Okay. So, let's start with the art that you make since um podcasting isn't traditionally a visual medium. So, can you describe for us what your art or your artistic style is? Yeah. So, I first became known for these things called newspaper blackout poems. And if you can imagine the CIA doing haik coup, that's what it looks like. So, what I do is I take an article of the New York Times and I leave just a few words behind and then I black out everything else. in it. They kind of connect into these little funny phrases or sayings. And that's what I got known for first. And and that's really what um when you watch my old TED talk, that's sort of the work that led to that TED talk. I love the like heavily redacted newspaper articles instead of as like a way of protecting national security as a way of finding beauty. Um yes, it's co-opted. And you know something else that's obviously you talk about this a lot in the in the TED talk and in your book um steal like an artist the idea to do that is your unique idea and yet it comes from a tradition of people who've done somewhat similar things even though though you didn't necessarily know that there was such a tradition when you started. So when you're a young artist and you sort of discover that the thing that you're doing is very similar to some people who have come before you. I think the only truly honorable thing to do is to locate yourself in a kind of lineage. Um, and to try to swim upstream and to say, ""Okay, well, these people that I might be borrowing from either unintentionally or intentionally, where did they come from? Where did their work come from? Who are they inspired by?"" And I think when you kind of swim upstream this way, you can kind of build a creative family tree. And what it does is it does a couple of things. One, it kind of gives you this whole kind of root system that you have that you can draw on and it kind of creates this like undercurrent of strong DNA, I guess, for your work. But the other thing it does is it gives you ideas for your own work cuz you can start saying, okay, that person did this. What did they not do? Like what did they not cover? Like what did these heroes of mine that came before? what what did they not get to attempt and also what would happen if I got these heroes together in a room and had them collaborate. Maybe that's what my work can be. So, it's kind of a general method of studying is the more you go back, the more you know how to go forwards. There's so much that I love about that this idea that like it's not actually about being solo. It's about being a part of a community and having a like you said a lineage but also a a peer group. You know, that was not original to me. That was something I stole. like that was that um the the musician Brian Eno uh puts it this way. He says, ""Most of the time when we talk about creative work, we talk about genius, like the individual genius, the very special, superhumanly talented individual."" You know, what we don't talk about as much is what Brian Eno calls seniors, which is the collective form of genius. You have to really understand that you're always collaborating because you're collaborating with what came before you. you're collaborating with the kind of now that will receive you. And in some ways, you could think about collaborating with the future even because when you write something, it doesn't do anything on its own. It's only when someone picks that book up and opens it that they activate whatever's inside, you know. So, creative work is always a collaboration. So, I always just um I always heir on the side of seniors and not genius. two quotes that I' that I think are related here from from you is um one is an artist's job is to collect ideas and then the other is nothing is original. All creative work builds on what came before. Yeah. So let's take them out of sequence. So the first part nothing is original. That's that's ancient wisdom, right? That's in the Bible. There's nothing new under the sun. And actually that idea was borrowed from 2,000 years before from the Egyptians. So that's a very ancient idea. I love the idea that there's nothing new as an idea is not a new idea. That's is not a new idea. Exactly. Incredible. Yeah. And neither is the idea that everything's been done. I came across this Egyptian poet from like 4,000 years ago that was complaining about how all the good words had been used. And so he was having trouble writing. So I can't make an original hieroglyph anymore, right? Like this is a 4,000 year history of writers complaining about how everything's been done. So that's like the starting point. If you say, okay, nothing is completely original. When you start from that place, then your job becomes not to just come up with great ideas, you know, out of your own noggin. It's to expand your brain out into the world and to like put your tentacles, you know, kind of out into the world and grab stuff and collect stuff and then you take it back to your workspace and you weld it into something new, as TS Elliott would say. You know, I took a a class once on um screenwriting. I had a how to format a movie script. And one of the parts that we spent a lot of time on was how do you come up with an idea for a movie? And the thing that I now can't unsee is this person, this teacher was really talking about how people get so obsessed with the idea of having a a completely original idea. Whereas most really successful movies are just take a an existing idea and then put it in a new place or put it in a different context. So the example they gave is like Alien is a haunted house in space. That's all you needed to do is like take a classic haunted house movie and then what if it was in space? Yeah. And that's how they pitch, you know, and that's how they pitch stuff. It's it's this but this, right? It's Jaws in space, you it's whatever. And I think that that's where the transformation part comes in. And I think that this is another Brian Eno idea is that it's always generative to take something from one place and you just literally transport it to another place. and and in in doing so you transform it. The reason I really like the steel metaphor, people ask me all the time, ""Oh, Austin, why you have to use the word steel? Like, isn't stealing bad and stuff?"" And the reason I like the steel metaphor is that it's kind of like being a jewel thief, you know? You're like always casing the joint. Like you're always looking around for like what are the little bits and nuggets that I might be able to pick up? And I think it causes you to pay a certain kind of attention to the world because if you assume that every person you meet has some like little nugget that you could use, something that you could steal, what you do is you pay attention to them in a way that's like really fruitful. And I think that a lot of people who want to be creative, who want to make new stuff, they really need to learn to pay attention to the world. And I just think that the steel metaphor causes people to pay attention to the world in this like very very specific and rich way. You obviously are really cross-disciplinary, right? You're an artist, you're a poet, you're a writer, you're an author. I think a lot of people also struggle with the question of how to self-define. And so I wonder how do you think about that? Is that something we should even do? I've gotten to this place where I have started thinking that nouns are more deleerous than verbs in the sense that I think that if you forget about whatever noun you're trying to be and you just focus on the verbs, the verbs will take you further. I'll be very concrete here. I meet a lot of people who want to be a writer, right? Like I'd love to be a writer. Oh, but that writing part, oh, I don't know about the writing part, you know? They would love to have like the noun, right? They'd love to be the writer and like all their ideas about like what goes into that. But the actual verb, the actual thing that you do, that's the thing you have to worry about. And I think that, you know, job titles, that's for other people, you know, like if you just consider yourself a novelist, well, what happens when you have a really good idea for a screenplay? You know, if you're only a stand-up comedian, what happens when you want to do a podcast, right? So if you focus on the verbs that you like to do and what kind of activates your creative mind, that's just way more fruitful than whatever the noun is that you want to be. There can be a really high mental bar to think about like, well, what would it mean if I was a writer or if I was an artist? But often there's a much lower internal bar to what would it mean to write something today? What would it mean to draw something today? Right? I wouldn't have to be a capital A artist to take out a pen and sketch something on this piece of paper. It can be bad. I'm still drawing something. Yeah. So, the book I'm working on right now that'll come out next year is called Don't Call It Art. The book is inspired by my kids when they were little. And um there's something the artist John Baldesari said. He said, you know, I learned so much from watching little kids draw. Kids don't call it art when they're throwing stuff around. They're just making stuff. And I think that when it comes to making stuff, if you could just forget about art, you know, again, forget about that noun, forget about making art and you just focus on like what are the things that you do? Like we're going to draw a picture and we're going to see what happens. We're going to get on stage and and and tell some jokes. And I I think that's like that was the major thing that my kids gave me. It was just like if you're not worried about the product and you're just focused on the process, just how good it feels to be scribbling That's something else that I wanted to talk to you about because I notice that you often write about and describe how your family and your kids are part of your creative life. They're not a they're not a separate thing. Yeah. And I I'm wondering how do you think about that balance between family and inspiration and work? I don't I don't think of balance at all and I don't think about separating. I see everything as just a big stew pot. I got really lucky early on. I had a couple of people I looked up to when I was younger that were very involved parents and also brilliant artists. There's a serial connelly line where he says the enemy of art is the pram in the hall. So the stroller in the hall is the enemy of art. on the whole like mothers do so much more labor that studying artist mothers ended up being a way more fruitful thing for me as a dad cuz it just gave me a higher bar to try to you know live up to. Um, but yeah, for me the kids, I mean, a fouryear-old, if you are feeling stuck creatively, a four, just borrow a four-year-old for an afternoon and you will see the world the way an artist sees it because everything is new to a four-year-old. They they haven't seen this stuff before and they've just acquired language and so they have all sorts of crazy they're poets really. They're like ecstatic poets. I used to just like scribble things that my kids were babbling, you know, cuz they're just so they're so tapped into the world in that kind of psychedelic artist way where they see the world with fresh eyes. And the reason they see them with fresh eyes is they've just never seen this stuff before. Especially thinking about, right, like an artist's job is to collect ideas. You are able to get new ideas from being a parent because you're seeing the same old stuff, the same mundane things, but through this completely different lens where all of a sudden like the idea of a lawn isn't just, oh yeah, everyone has a lawn. It's like it's grass and you could do this with the grass. And did you know that if you dig there's like a worm down here and what's a worm? It's great that you mentioned grass because and lawns because that's what Walt Whitmann is doing in the first, you know, poem in in Leaves of Grass is he's literally looking at a grass and like talking to a kid about it. So, it's like that's that's like that's what a poet does. A poet looks at the ordinary and pays really close attention to it and then the ordinary plus extra attention equals the extraordinary. But like yeah, with the kids I was like, these people are going to be my teachers. I'm gonna make these little beginners my teachers was kind of my idea. I just like sort of started out with this idea that they would have way more to teach me than I would have to teach them. And that's what it turned out to be. And like that that's where the whole idea from this next book came is that I just was like what happens when you're the studio assistant to these little pint-sized Picassos, you know, cuz my four-year-olds drew like every artist dreams of, you know, they would just just go at it, look at it, ah, yeah, great. And throw it over their shoulder and start over. It's just the just the most magical way of drawing. Just the way every artist would love to make work. you know, this idea that a lot of parenting I think can be viewed as like uh mistakes and messes and that if you look at it in a different way. Um, you know, you gave this example of like your kids I think it was your couch but like they they drew in permanent marker on your couch and all of a sudden you're like this is a masterpiece. My son Jules just got really into drawing skeletons and he drew a couple of skeletons on the couch cushions of the outdoor couch and I posted it and said, ""Well, sometimes we go overboard."" And my friend said, ""What if you embroidered it?"" And so my wife actually embroidered over the drawings for the couch cushions. And so it became this whole thing. We often think that we take care of things because we love them. But actually, it's just as true that we love things and that they're meaningful to us because we take care of them. that putting in the work builds the relationship. It's it's not necessarily just one way or the other. Yeah, this is a beautiful idea that I think my friend Rob Walker first turned me on. Uh he has a book uh called the um the art of noticing. And in that book, he has a an assignment he gives his students where the assignment is to care for something. And so you have to care for something for a week. And um I I think that he got this idea from a student of his who took care of a plant for a week. and he was like all of a sudden I love plants you know cuz I spent time like caring for this plant you know I see everything as connected and so it's like that with your art if you are feeling uninspired and even if you hate your work there's something about just showing up and going through the motions going through the motions is a very underrated phrase because that's what you do when you're a creative person and I think that's the big misunderstanding with creative work is so many People think you have the idea and then you just have to figure out how to express it. And I find that it's really in the work. It's like writing is not about having an idea and then expressing it. Writing is about figuring out what you think. Like figuring out what is going on inside you and what you really think. You don't know it until you see it on the page. I think that the one of the biggest misconceptions that I had and that I still try and fight against is this idea that what I'm going for is something perfect. Like if only I could write a perfect book or craft a perfect joke or have a post online that every person who saw it would have to say, ""Well, that is perfect."" Like that is something that I kind of think is my goal. But then in practice, the things that I feel the most are the most meaningful to me, the things that I feel the most connected to are the ones that are like obviously broken and I found ways to fix and take care of. Right. Yeah. And and I think it's really important to think about some of the art that you love or the people you look up to and why is it that we're so attracted to things that are imperfect in other people's work and then we don't let it into our own work. And I think that sometimes when things are imperfect, it lets us into the work a little bit. You know, if something's totally perfect, it's like, well, who would want to enter this thing and enter into a conversation with it? But if things are like just slightly off, then it like kind of brings us in. Like I think the Japanese are a lot better at that than us, you know? I think like there the idea of wobbishabi is like good like find things that are like that have a, you know, like a little bit of scratches and it's been worn in. I love the art of kinsugi, which is when you like break a pot and you use like golden glue to put it together and they they don't try to hide the seams, they actually bring them out. But um I think there's a lot to be learned from that tradition of imperfection. That's what punk rock did for me when I discovered punk rock or you know some of the real like rougher indie filmmakers like Jim Jarmish or something like that. like that that's that kind of stuff like really spoke to me as a kid cuz it was like I think it was uh Bernard Sumner of New Order. He's like, ""Yeah, I saw the Sex Pistols on stage. They were terrible. I wanted to get up on stage and be terrible with them."" It's like that you see imperfection in someone else. You're like, I want to do that. My version of this is improv comedy. If it's a really good scene, it means that like people are having so much fun that they're like, I wish I could get up there and like be in that scene. It's so funny. I wish I was part of that. And the thing that I think I've loved the most about performing comedy of that kind with other people is that you're not trying to avoid the mistake. You're trying to look at the mistake and pounce on it and use it as a gift. Like yes. Oh, what a fun that is to be like, ""Okay, if you don't if you don't stumble over your words at all and you don't say anything weird, we're going to be we're going to be high and dry up, right?"" Someone needs to do something weird unintentionally so then we can take that path and make it look good and make it look like it wasn't a mistake at all. Well, you know, like I live in a city where it's like keep Austin weird is like the awful slogan we've had for so long. And I've been modifying it myself lately. I've been like be the weird you wish to see in the world, right? And I think about that a lot. And that's kind of what you're talking about on stage. You want something weird to happen. You want a mistake just enough to make it interesting, right? And that's what we're wanting. We want to mess up just enough to make things interesting and give us something to work with, you know? So there's these artistic ways that you can put this into practice. Even if you're not, you know, if you have a totally boring, random job that you don't particularly care about, you can still have these creative and artistic outlets in other parts of your life, too. Oh, absolutely. One of the primary things I tell people is to get a hobby. Uh, I think hobbies are just so underrated in this culture because we're this culture of like time is money and then if you do get a hobby, you're supposed to professionalize immediately. Like I love riding bikes and people say, ""Oh, you're a cyclist."" I say, ""No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not a cyclist. I like to ride a bicycle, you know? I don't have a bunch of gear. It's not about like, you know, optimizing my speed and all that stuff. I like to ride bikes. I like to be an amateur. It's the love of it. You know, I've learned now that actually like the best way to crack that problem if you're struggling with a creative problem or you can't quite figure out how something works isn't to just like keep, you know, trying to scratch through the concrete wall. To just like do it like that is to go, okay, I'm going to let that cook on the back burner and I'm going to go do something fun. I'm going to go play with my kid and we're going to take a bike ride or I'm going to go to the pool or I'm going to do something that's just like totally random. And then when I come back, I'm like, ""Oh, it was actually working back there. I got a lot more brain than I'm conscious of. Well, we talked about collaboration earlier and one of the things that you're always collaborating with is time. Time is really a resource that people don't utilize enough. The power of a good night's sleep or just a 15minute break. Just that time travel of becoming someone else and coming back to your problem. So now I'm seeing this thing through a different lens. So yeah, you're absolutely right. It's like people think if I just sit here and I pound and I pound and I pound and I like drill through I'll get to this thing and it's like no the more you like you put your time in and then you say okay I'm going to walk away and then you come back you go away so you can come back right there's like a really lot of um examples and a depth of research showing that for creative work that the kind of the maximum that almost anyone can do is three to four hours of creative work in a day which is not to say you don't do more work in a day. It's just not creative work in in Right. the really intense like p like really intense creative stuff. Yeah. I don't have more than three or four hours in me. How do you think about that? Like committing your future self to doing something versus leaving yourself this wide open space to kind of do whatever and have it come up. How how do you balance those two pieces? Because you obviously need a little bit of both. Oh, well that's that's I love that you said how do you leave this wide open space because that to me is the spontaneity is the kind of like you you have the like um you know you have the date you have the the you know what you're going to do. You're going to write a newsletter but what's going to go into it? And that's like the spontaneous part. those blackout poems we talked about, when I was making one of those, two or three, four or five of those every day, I knew I was going to sit down and try to make a poem, but I didn't know what it was going to be. And that was the I knew I was going to sit down and work, but I didn't know what was going to happen. And I think that's like the magic thing that creative people have to get hooked on. You have to get hooked into the kind of like what's going to happen part of it, right? like to be really really orderly, to schedule your work, to to like show up like it's a job, but then to get hooked into that magic of like what's going to happen this time. I love that. That really resonates for me. People ask me like, ""What's your schedule?"" And I'm like, ""Well, I know what I'm going to do on Monday and I know what I'm going to do on Thursday."" Everything else is like, ""Who knows?"" Like, we don't know what's going to happen. If I scheduled every portion of my day and my week for something, that would not create the space for new things to fill it and to happen. You know, I think the tension is kind of an interesting idea in creative work. I I'm a person who thinks that there's a proper tension between opposites in creative work and that actually the energy for someone's work is found in that. So, let me give you one of my tensions, which is I find myself to be a deeply lazy person. I know we're not supposed to use that word anymore, like laziness doesn't exist or whatever. It's, you know, but I'm lazy. Like, I'm a lazy person. Like, left to my own defenses, I would sit around and do nothing. Like, really, I love to lay around and do nothing. But I'm an intensely disciplined person. And by discipline I mean uh I take Robert Frip's definition of def of discipline which is making a commitment in time. I know that if I show up in a certain way over time I will get the things that I want. And so I use my intense discipline to balance out my laziness. But if I was just disciplined I don't know that I would come up with the same work. You know, because it's like there's something about that tension between my deep longing to do nothing and to be extremely disciplined. Something arises out of that, right? And I think you can find these opposites and these tensions in your work. And I think that like this happens a lot in in the creative life. I could just be giving away the fact that I'm a Gemini if that means anything to people who are listening. But I've had these tensions. I have these opposites that pull at me as a creative person. Pictures and words would be another one. You know, I have this deep, you know, this deep longing to like make things out of language and to move, you know, activate that part of my brain, but I also have this nonverbal part of my brain that just wants to make pictures. You know, I'm a fairly mediocre writer. Like, I'm like, okay, I'm a perfectly mediocre like artist, but when you put the two together, I become pretty good, right? And so it's like the tension between those two. So if a guitar string is too slack, it just buzzes. It doesn't make any sound. But if you ratchet it up too tight, it's going to snap. The music comes from the proper tension between the two like poles that the guitar strings on. So I think in a lot of creative life, people look at ways like, man, I just like I got to chill out and like minimize my tension, you know? And I'm like, no, you need to find the proper tension. You need to find the like the right tension that makes your work sing. And I think a lot of that is identifying the opposing forces within you and like trying to wrangle some sort of like proper tension so you can get like the music. I love that. I think the guitar string metaphor is so good and and it really is. I've never heard anyone put it that way, but it it really resonates with me. Um resonates, pun intended. Very good. Thank you so much. [Laughter] Steal like an artist. We've talked about keep going and show your work. Keep going is about making art in chaotic times and show your work is about how to put your work out there publicly. The thing that is my personal challenge that I really struggle with and maybe it's just an emotional thing is when I combine those two. making art in chaotic times and then putting it out because I get so self-conscious about putting things out there that are not directly improving the world at a time when it feels like the world so desperately needs to be improved. That's often the barrier where I go like I can't I can't post about this. I can't send an email about my little comedy show or send them, you know, hey, listen to this great conversation when it's like it just feels like it's such a dire time and and it's kind of always a dire time in some way. So, how do you think about that for yourself or for how should I think about it is really a selfish question. Yeah. So, here's what I think about art. I have friends who think that art can save the world and I don't think art saves the world at all. I think that art is trying to throw art at the world is like Kurt Vonagget said it's like attacking a knight in armor with a hot fudge sundae, you know, like I don't actually think art saves the world. I think it saves lives. Like I think it saves individual people. And if you do that enough, you save the world in like tiny ways. And so when I think about like my own work, I'm thinking about just reaching one reader. If I can like if I can just like make one reader's day better, maybe they carry a little bit of something into their day and if I can reach like enough people and I can kind of improve their day and I can I can stand up for the things that I think are worth saving in the culture because I think in some ways just being a person that's curious, who pays attention, who spends time making things, these are things that are rapidly leaving our culture like it's just like going away. If you can be a person who models that kind of thing, you're already like making a dent in in things. You know, I always think about being that kid, you know, being 15 and growing up in the middle of a cornfield and how much that music, how much that comedy, how much that, you know, those movies meant to me, but also how that stuff activated a spirit in me that then, you know, made me look at the world a little bit different. So, I think that like I'm not sure that art changes the world, but I think it changes people. And I think that's slowly, you know, it it affects change. Everybody needs to discover their gift, like what you've been put here to do, you know, like I'm not really an activist. Like I'm not very good at that, but I can show up and show people what it's like to think and pay attention and to, you know, have a spine as far as your own point of view goes. And so I think that if everybody right now would show up and do what they know how to do, like I think things would be better immediately. Actually, whatever you've devoted your life to, if it was worth doing 6 months ago, I think it's worth doing now. You know, you just got to show up and do what you know how to do. I struggle with how do I do something that is gonna, you know, when there's only a limited amount of time in my day and in my week and uh how do I do something that's not going to make any money and potentially be humiliating and feel really bad and yet I know that that is the path towards new exciting ways of self-expression is to be humiliated and be terrible at something for a long time potentially. I think about someone like Chris Rock who, you know, when he works up one of those specials, he gets into a club and there's no phones and he knows it's going to be bad and it's and it's just like it's in private, not doing things publicly. I think you have to find some sort of wood shetty kind of like like private place where you could put yourself in that kind of beginner's mind, throw stuff at the wall and see what happens type thing. And so I think that's why side projects and hobbies and stuff like that, putting yourself in a place where you can, you know, have a sort of safe failure, you know, because when you're starting out, you got nothing to lose. You'll do anything, right? You know, I mean, like even even a book like Steal Like an Artist, people are like, ""How'd you write this book?"" I'm like, ""I didn't know you couldn't do things."" Citizen Canain is a perfect example. Orton Wells, this is in the new book. the um Orson Wells said that you know how did we do Citizen Kane and he said ignorance like sheer ignorance I didn't know what wasn't possible and that made it possible there's a great story in um the element the Ken Robinson the late this is a great talk about the TED talk right Ken Robinson the TED talk where he says you know little girls you know drawing in a class and the teach you know the classroom teacher says what are you drawing and she says I'm drawing a picture of God And the classroom teacher says, ""Well, nobody knows what God looks like."" And she says, ""They will in a minute, you know, and it's like, but I think that's like with the kids, that was something that really helped is like what happens when we just sit here and draw something that we know we're just going to toss in the recycle bin afterwards?"" Like what, you know, what what what happens when we know, you know, we make something that we know is not getting recorded. we make something we know we're going to burn later. That kind of thing. You know, you're just trying to like put yourself in that position where you got nothing to lose. That's why I like writing a diary, you know, cuz I can like I I mean like thes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 old basic things like my diary, I can whine and say awful things that, you know, that that I would never want to say publicly. But yeah, it's just like not having anything to lose again, you know? How do you do it? I don't know. It's hard for me, too. Thank you so much for being on the show. This was such a pleasure. I really I'm so excited. Thank you," Chris. This was great. I really had a lot of fun.""",unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fkOMupkw5D8,"Silence. It can be a needed moment
of peace and contemplation. But what happens
when silence becomes a barrier? A barrier that muffles the voice of truth, of advocacy, of change? Speak up. Advocate for yourself. Stand up for what you believe in. That's what they say, right? Well even though I know they’re right, it's easier said than done. I'm sure we can all think of a time
when we faced a crossroads. Perhaps the precipice
of an uncomfortable conversation when speaking up felt like the right,
if not even essential, path. But silence seemed safer. I can vividly see and feel
myself being in those moments. Times when I stood red-faced,
embarrassed or offended, frustrated or angry, with a sinking feeling in my stomach, unable to find my voice
and unsure if I had the courage, confidence or will to face the difficult
conversation before me. Sound familiar? We're not alone. Research from VitalSmarts, a global leader in organizational
performance and leadership, tells us people would rather
quit their jobs than address a challenging situation. In this post-pandemic time, with baby boomers retiring and a wave
of quiet resignation upon us, the world seems
to be working short-staffed. I'm a nurse and have worked
in healthcare leadership for a long time, and I'm here to tell you,
in this profession, we can't risk losing anyone. Especially not for the reason
of avoiding a challenging conversation. In a world where we are experiencing
increasingly rapid cycles of change, we can expect difficult conversations,
particularly in the workplace, to happen more often than ever before. Moments such as sharing feedback,
identifying mistakes or calling out disrespect -- they’re not always easy
but often critical to the performance
of both individuals and a team. In health care, where stakes are high, our willingness to raise concerns can be vital to the quality
of care we provide, but also to the safety
of patients and the care team. In fact, research also tells us
that when we do speak up, we experience more job satisfaction, increased team morale, and, in my world, support better patient outcomes. I've experienced this for myself. Now I don’t have all the answers,
and I don’t always get it right. In fact, I make a mess of it sometimes. But often I've found it's a bit
like cardio or weightlifting. Well we feel a bit
vulnerable at the time. With practice, we start
to experience the benefits. It gets easier, and we get better at it. We need to find a path to help us get past that initial fight,
flight or freeze response, to get us to the table and make leaning into uncomfortable
conversations the desired action for our own benefit, as well as to benefit those around us. Now I was fortunate, I had some amazing
role modeling by parents who encouraged me to use my voice. Specifically when I knew I should but didn't want to. My mom, an intensive care
nurse for many years, had a special ability
to address tough topics: traumas, embarrassing bodily functions or sharing critical feedback. She always created air time
for normally avoided matters. With a fierce moral compass
that was sometimes incredibly frustrating, she advocated for what was right, showing me the importance
of standing up for oneself and others, even when uncomfortable to do so. My mom, she died a long time ago now, and I still miss her desperately. Something I think I miss the most, though, is her always knowing
the right thing to do. And the way she guided me
with that moral compass. And despite having a couple
of degrees under my belt, lessons learned from that moral compass, they guide me more
than any of my formal learning. She showed me that as leaders,
and I mean all leaders, both formal and informal, we play a pivotal role
in leaning into courageous conversations and creating a safe place
for others to do the same. It's probably her strong
commitment in this area that inspired me to go
into healthcare leadership, a path that often puts me
in an area of high conflict and tricky conversations. But in doing so exposes me to innovation, changemaking and meaningful work. It's an incredible career
that I'm honored to be a part of, and I owe it to my mom
and myself to do it well. So when I find myself
needing courage and confidence, making that momentous step into the abyss
of a difficult conversation, I try to remember my mom's moral compass and the principles she worked
so hard to nurture in me. I imagine holding a compass in my hand, the cool metal upon my skin, taking a breath, a moment to pause and ground myself. I see the directions of north,
south, east and west as symbols, reminders of her core teachings. North, I think about the North Star, a guide towards the good
and right thing to do. In tricky situations,
I remember my mom's voice. ""Be the best version of yourself."" ""Take the high road."" ""Say what needs to be said."" South. The S in south reminds me of support. When people support me,
I feel seen, cared for. When it comes to supporting others,
I try to do the same. Leaning into tricky
conversations with kindness and an intention of helping people grow. And east, the E stands for empathy. Empathy sets the tone for a conversation. As a leader, I want people
to feel safe coming to me. I try to understand their feelings and create a safe place
for them to be themselves. And west. The W stands for wonder. Getting curious about what
might be going on for the other person. I ask questions and listen, so I understand
before trying to be understood. When I focus on the principles
of the compass, I'm able to move
from reactive to proactive, getting into a mindset
where I can be true to my values and share my voice. I recall a situation not long ago where I was able
to put the compass to use. I was in a change management
and communications role for a big project. And while the work was complex and bumpy, I was proud of myself. I was writing good stuff, inspiring hearts and minds. Or so I thought. One day a physician came into the office
where I was meeting with my boss, my boss’s boss
and a number of other leaders. He had one of my newsletters
printed out and was waving it in the air. ""Who's the cheerleader
sending out this stuff?"" As an optimist -- (Laughter) sometimes to a fault, I knew right away,
that cheerleader was me. While I was embarrassed,
I had a split second to decide. Stay silent, or speak up. The compass came in handy in that moment. North Star: What was the good and right thing to do? Well I needed to own my work. Take the feedback. So I said, ""That would be me."" He lowered his arm and said,
""Well, this is too positive. Not an accurate representation
of what we're going through."" While still defensive, I remembered: support and empathy. I wanted to create a safe place
where he could feel seen and heard. So I suggested we sit down together so I could better understand his concerns. Next step? Wonder. We went to his office
and I asked curious questions. And over some tea, he told me his story. He got out a red pen and circled the nine times I'd mentioned
something positive in that article. I acknowledged it was too many,
understandably devaluing. I then asked if we could look
for times I'd mentioned challenges. To his surprise, and frankly, my own, 18 times. 18. I'd mentioned things
that needed to be fixed. I was able to let him know
I was embarrassed by being called out
in front of my superiors, and he apologized. You know, that time spent together, it was valuable for me, and I think we both
took something meaningful away. So I always remember the moral compass. North: North Star, south: support, east: empathy, and west: wonder. I know when I'm true to my compass, I'm courageous, confident, the person I want to be, and I think the daughter
my parents would be proud of. And with my husband and our two daughters, I get the chance to pay it forward. So I hope you'll join me
in leaning into tricky conversations, not only finding our voices but understanding
the imperative to use them. Stand up against the wrong, champion the right and be the voice for those
who cannot speak for themselves. No matter how shaky or unsure, we can be a powerful instrument
of change and advocacy, leaving all people involved
