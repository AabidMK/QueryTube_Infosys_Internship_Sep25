BzUb5MOysLo,How Displaced People Are Driving Local Economies | Julienne Oyler | TED,"The number of forcibly displaced people across the world is on the rise. While aid systems often focus on providing basic necessities like food and shelter, Julienne Oyler and her team at the nonprofit Inkomoko have a more ambitious plan: invest in refugee entrepreneurs in order to help them build their businesses, uplift their communities and gain access to financial services. She describes how displaced people are already driving local economies — and shows what it will take to bring their innovations to scale. (This ambitious idea is part of The Audacious Project, TED’s initiative to inspire and fund global change.) (Recorded at TED2025 on April 9, 2025)

Katherine Cross is a researcher on online harassment and the author of Log Off: Why Posting and Politics (Almost) Never Mix. She shares why she believes social media is “anti-political” and how virtual engagement will not achieve the necessary political work for us. Katherine and Chris also discuss the limitations of short-form content in conveying decades of geopolitical strife, why our lives would be better off without social media, and the guardrails platforms could utilize to help users engage with posts critically and to slow down viral misinformation.

DM6UVe5jsxA,I’ll Probably Lose My Job to AI. Here’s Why That’s OK | Megan J. McArdle | TED,"Artificial intelligence could cost many of us our careers — but that doesn’t mean we should stop its development, says journalist Megan J. McArdle. As she watches AI encroach on her own craft, she shares a fresh take on the 19th-century Luddites, who tried to destroy machines that would upend their trade. Looking back, McArdle reframes today’s fears with a poignant question: If we halt progress to protect the present, what might we be stealing from the future? (Recorded at TED2025 on April 9, 2025)

UbzsTXDvhAQ,When Is It OK to Be Wrong? (w/ Tenelle Porter) | How to Be a Better Human | TED,"Tenelle Porter’s job is to study humility. Specifically the intellectual kind -- the idea that we might be wrong or mistaken about some of our beliefs. Tenelle talks with How to Be a Better Human host Chris Duffy about why she thinks intellectual humility is so important, how to cultivate it, and why it’s the missing piece in so many conversations these days. Whether it’s in politics, academia or social media, Tenelle argues discovering you are wrong doesn’t have to be a painful realization; rather it can lead to positive discovery.

Ztx0Bch3h9s,Why Climate Action Is Unstoppable — and “Climate Realism” Is a Myth  | Al Gore | TED,"In this urgent and hard-hitting talk, Nobel Laureate Al Gore thoroughly dismantles the fossil fuel industry’s narrative of ""climate realism,"" contrasting their misleading claims with the remarkable advancements in renewable energy. Drawing on data showing clear signs of progress across the world, Gore makes a powerful case that we already have everything needed to solve the climate crisis — and reminds us of what the most valuable renewable resource actually is.
