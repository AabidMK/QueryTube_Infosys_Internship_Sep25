yguDjZcUpH8,Lone Wolf Dev turned Open Source Super Contributor Tom Mondloch [Podcast #190],"Tom Mondloch quit programming after he finished community college. After a few years of odd jobs, he decided to get back into programming and discovered freeCodeCamp. 

He was just learning his own way, and didn't think freeCodeCamp's linear curriculum would be worth his time. But he stuck with it, got good, and ultimately started contributing to our open source project.

He's since joined freeCodeCamp's staff and archetected freeCodeCamp's entire relational database curriculum, which you can run in your browser or right inside your VS Code editor.

Tom shares tips for:
- Brushing up on your programming skills if you've taken a few years off
- Contributing to open source
- Using AI codegen tools sensibly and not relying too heavily on them

He also talks about the role of vocational college, his love of the outdoors, and how working remotely allows him to continue to live in small town middle America without the need to move to a big city.

A huge thank you to the 10,889 kind folks who make this podcast possible by supporting freeCodeCamp through a monthly donation. Join these kind folks and help our mission by going to https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate

News items:

1. freeCodeCamp just published this comprehensive front end development course where you build your own browser-based code editor. You can code along at home and build your own single page app development environment with tabs for editing your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Along the way, you'll learn some intermediate JS techniques that allow for instant live preview, so you can see the results of your code changes right away. (4 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/code-your-own-code-editor/

2. I also made a quick announcement about some big improvements to our core Full Stack Development curriculum. In short, we're breaking down our new coursework into a series of six new certifications you can earn along the way to the capstone cert. These include Python, Relational Databases, Front End Libraries, and more. (5 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/introducing-freecodecamp-checkpoint-certifications/

3. freeCodeCamp also just published this new course that will help you pass the Databricks Data Engineer Associate certification exam. Andrew Brown is a CTO who has passed practically every DevOps exam under the sun, and he teaches this course. He'll introduce you to key concepts like Clusters, Structured Streaming, Data Lakes, and more. (8 hour course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/prepare-for-the-databricks-data-engineer-associate-certification-exam-and-pass/

5. Enjoy this breezy read about Cosine Similarity and the role it plays in Large Language Models. As its author, Manish, says, Cosine Similarity is ‚Äúa bridge between human language and machine understanding. It allows a model to treat meaning as geometry, turning questions and answers into points in space.‚Äù Not only will you learn the math involved, you'll also see it implemented in Python code.

MiGXhDvuvEg,Learn Chess and Become a Better Developer with Ihechikara Abba (ELO rating of 2285) [Podcast #189],"On this week's freeCodeCamp podcast we're talking with software engineer Ihechikara Abba, who has a chess ELO rating of 2285, putting him among top competitive chess players. We just published his freeCodeCamp course on chess end games, and an accompanying handbook. 

We talk about:
how learning chess can make you a better developer
tips for getting into embedded systems development with Arduino
how contributing to open source can serve as an alternative to building up a social media presence

Links from our discussion:

Ihechikara's checkmate patterns handbook: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/checkmate-patterns-in-chess-for-beginners/

Ihechikara's Arduino embedded systems handbook: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-arduino-handbook/

Links from community news segment at the beginning: 

1. freeCodeCamp just published a GameDev for beginners course that will help you build your first 2D platformer game. First you'll learn the basics of the open source Godot game engine, and its Python-like GDScript programming language. Then you'll dive into Godot's editor, custom tile sets, game mechanics, scoring, checkpoint systems, and more. By the end of the course, you'll have your own game that your friends can play in any browser. (1 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-game-development-by-building-your-first-platformer-with-godot/

2. freeCodeCamp just launched our daily coding challenges. You can solve these programming puzzles using Python or JavaScript. Build up your data structures + algorithms skills each day, right in your browser or in the freeCodeCamp iPhone or Android app. We're launching with a backlog of 30 challenges that are live now. See how many you can solve. (article with more details): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/introducing-freecodecamp-daily-python-and-javascript-challenges-solve-a-new-programming-puzzle-every-day/

3. Learn how to build your own secure PHP web apps using the popular open source Symfony framework. This intermediate course is taught by Beau Carnes, who has many years of experience as a software engineer and as a high school special ed teacher. He'll quickly fill you in on Symfony's security features, which enable you to query encrypted data without ever even needing to decrypt it on your MongoDB database server. You can code along and home and build your own secure personal finance app while applying these new concepts. (1 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-secure-web-applications-with-php-symfony-and-mongodb/

4. I also recommend reading this quick post by a freeCodeCamp community member on the importance of Hackathons. They opened all sorts of doors for him in his job search. (10 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/why-every-student-should-join-hackathons/

I also recommend you watch this video essay on Janet Jackson's ""Rhythm Nation"" explaining the physics behind why the song breaks some laptop hard drives when played: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y3RGeaxksY

And the song of the week is 1989's Rhythm Nation by a then 23-year-old Janet Jackson. The song's great but you really want to watch the video version, with its awesome dance choreography. I've linked to it in the description. Listen to it after the podcast. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAwaNWGLM0c

Zv2a6ixXEQc,How to focus on building your skills when everything's so distracting with Ania Kub√≥w [Podcast #187],"For this week's interview, I'm talking with Ania Kub√≥w. She's a software engineer and prolific programming teacher on YouTube.

She shares tips for:
- Getting into game development and using JavaScript and browser games as an entry point
- How to keep your focus in an increasingly distracting world
- How AI tools are a jack hammer and you usually just need a regular hammer
- What she's learned from hanging out with Chinese developers

CORRECTION: I (Quincy) say during the interview that the Uber found a way to access microphones on iOS without users' knowledge. There have been documented cases of malware doing this (like Pegasus) but Uber didn't do this. They did do a lot of other shady things, like continue collecting data even after you deleted their app ‚Äì but mic spying was not one of them. Yes, early Uber was an ethical tire fire. But it's important to get facts right here.

We talk about:

- Why you should still learn CSS in 2025
- How teaching concepts improves your own understanding of them

Support also comes from the 11,113 kind folks who support freeCodeCamp through a monthly donation. Join these kind folks and get involved in our mission by going to donate.freecodecamp.org

- How he balances being a musician and writer with the practical realities of providing for a family of 6

CORRECTION: Vincent van Gogh was supported by his younger brother ‚Äì not his brother in-law. van Gogh never married so he never had a brother in law. I'm not sure why I thought that. Also, he seems to have sold more than one painting in his life (as many of us were taught in school), but nowhere near enough paintings to support himself as an artist.
