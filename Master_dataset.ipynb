forward plus now this is a different level ds algo course something which you haven't seen before you might have seen a lot of people coming across and launching their courses but this is something which you wouldn't have seen by the end of this video you will understand what kind of courses this this is this is a beast all together so most of the people who are offering courses what they're offering is life classes where you have thousands of people in it thousands of people means a topic that could have been taught in 30 minutes now ends up taking 1 hour or more than it i know the pain i know the pain trust me the last 3 months what i've done is i've literally taken a subscription of each person's course and i've attended them what i figured out is no one attends these live classes because they're messy they're so clumsy with so many people into it the portal is so messed up everyone like if you notice everyone is launching but literally no one has guts to show their portal no one till date has done it you would have done it but the portal is so clumsy you don't get codes over there you don't get written descriptions imagine if you're revising and you want to learn a particular algorithm you have to scroll through that 3our video to figure out where that algorithm was start because chapters are not even added that was the condition of these courses so when i see the end product what we have build it is not even comparable to what others are giving so i still remember 2020 is when we started and our channel started going up from something known as an sd sheet we were the first ones who started the era of the dss sheets and then everyone started copying that trend because it was something which was very very successful the sd sheet was there on a google doc the google doc had a notification saying that there are too many people on the sheet you cannot access it as of now and that is when the idea of the website came in and then we started in website the website was doing well well it was on wordpress and then people started coming in and with more and more people coming in and using it there were more demands one of the demands was you know we need a lot of customizations into it so during the start of this year we ended up moving from a wordpress to a custom website and because we moved into a custom website the traffic again went up and you would not believe the last month we hit 15 million 1 15 million page visits with a 5 million unique sessions with an average engagement time of 20 minutes per user could can you just imagine this this is what we are serving as of today we have a youtube channel i think 600k yeah 600k is what we have as of now and over there we are clocking 6 million views in the last 28 days 6 million views for a long form channel for an educational channel which only makes videos in one genre that is unheard of i think probably everyone in the country is reading data structures from our channel this is where the idea of take you forward plus came in we thought why not make something which helps us yes which does helps us because you know managing such a huge scale traffic if you're an engineer you know what are the cost so it is tough to survive so we thought either we will shut it down or either we'll make something such that whatever we generate from that that will help us make take forward even bigger and whatever we are launching probably it's going to set a bar so without wasting any of your time let's get straight into take you forward plus the moment you land at take you forward plus we ask you hey what is your learning goal if you're a beginner you could actually go ahead and you know customize your learning goal whatever number of days you want to give or if you want to start with a 3 months 4 months if you're a working professional you can do that imagine i say 18 180 days and i say begin my journey so what happens is i basically give you a tour and then we tell you okay 6th august till 17th august you can do beginner problems and then you could head over to 18th august to 19th august where you can do the sorting now we have we have 100 beginner problems if you're someone who who doesn't knows c of coding don't worry we start from basic we literally start from basic of c java and then we do a lot of questions 100 questions is what we will be doing before moving on to sorting arrays and all of these topics as you see across right now what if you are a working professionals we have t it yes we have t it so there are days assigned to it 11 days it could straight away go and maybe i'll just subtract 10 days from it and i'll just give one day just to revise the beginner problems you can remove the number of days from here and you can customize your road map according to your like someone might need a lot more time in you know graphs so you can just add those 10 days that you have removed over here and we back to 180 days yes we back to 180 days perfect and the day one says today we'll be doing big up problems we can go to the calendar and the calendar is going to tell you if you're missing any day you might have a question hey this is telling us the road map for the next you know six months and in v2 we will be integrating this with google calendar for the people who want it to be integrated so that they have active notifications okay so what if uh you're traveling what if you're on a vacation what if you have exams we have a pause button you can pause the road map and whenever you come back we will restart from that day so this is something that's going to push you that's going to make sure that you are on your schedule got it perfect so you can do the beginner problems if you don't know anything and then you can start with sorting also with every we have made sure with every topic like we have 300 around questions with every topic we starting with some fundamental question just to brush you up then we go across to a lot of other questions and then at the end we make sure you have a contest to do once you've done a bunch of questions you can do the contest so our road map is set we know what to do when right what is the next step hey where are the videos where is the course content let's deep dive into it so if you're a beginner and if you have started we have everything for you over here right from language basics literally everything we have uh going to logic building patterns time complexity matths aries hashing recursion strings link list stack and this entire section is recorded fresh it is recorded entirely new because i've gone slow so that you can pick up right even if you don't know you can pick it up perfect what if you already know ds alg go or rather you want to brush up or rather you want to prepare or rather you want to do something which is not beginner stuff that is when you come over here so we have all the topics covered if you see every topic is covered over here so if i go to array over here we have broken down the topic into subtopics as well we do not start with you know straightway medium or hard questions we start with some fundamental questions then we go to logic building and then maybe some frequent asked questions as well so imagine i go to logic building and i go to a question this is how the interface looks like so this is the entire course interface it just doesn't have a single video which is of 3 hours where you'll have to yourself figure out which part is tau when so this is how the entire interface looks like so you see the problem you see the maximum points you can score and then there is the problem statement well defined example one example two we have a feature known as guess this is the guess feature again i'm repeatedly stressing focus on the learning experience so once you've understood the problem understood both the examples we want to make sure you have really understood the problem before you type the code on the right side so i'll go to the next question and this is an easier one to guess because the previous one i'll have to solve so for this for this the answer is zero so when you click on the submit what happens is it gives you plus 10 so you can accumulate points as you move across this will be a sort of motivation for you that you want to you know be as correct as possible right okay so we get some points now the next step we need to solve this problem so again uh you could literally solve this problem by clicking on run we have some custom test cases that will be running and then you can add your own custom test case so that you can test this code now we have kept one thing in mind when you're appearing for online assessments or any of the coding interviews they do not tell you on which test case your code is failing so for that reason we are just giving you two test cases we want you to think by yourself we want you to think by yourself this is not a competition it is a learning experience so when you click on the submit button what happens is the code is submitted on our own compiler and you uh your code will be running on some small cases and then some on large cases got it once that is done so you can you know trace your submission over here once youve submitted your code you might be thinking hey uh have i written good code or not so if you see over here i have intentionally put an extra follow lo so what you could do is there is a review button so you can click on the review button what will happen is there will be an extensive code review by our self trained ai bot this ai bot is trained on our data set on all our editorials on all of my videos it will be telling you if you see it tells you line number 11 remove the empty fall loop since it is not performing any operation because i've written a clean code it doesn't gives me a lot of feedbacks but when you will be writing codes around graphs dynamic programming it will be very very like it will be very very ruth it'll be telling you this is bad this is bad if you written a very long code it will be telling you maybe this could be put into a function and you can modularize it it will be reviewing your code as per industry standard so that you keep on writing very good quality of code understood what if uh you have written a code and you just you have analyzed uh the time complexity but you still want to be sure about it that's when we have an analyze button so you can click on the analyze button and what that will do is it will be telling you about the time complexity as well as the space complexity and it'll be telling you perfectly perfect once that is done hey what if uh you know i'll go back to this question yeah what if uh i was not able to solve this how do i solve this so this is your first step learning experience where you try on the problem yourself i just don't want you to watch the video directly if you haven't done it no worries we have a video for you as well now this is what you usually get in most of uh the courses a video so we have the video for you over here as well it is just a small offering i'll call because it is an entire learning experience along with the course so you got the video you have kept one thing in mind one is once when you start once when you start you start with very basic approach you know the easiest of approaches that comes to your mind but as you move across you can easily you know figure out the brute approach it's very simple the brute approaches are very simple and it easily comes to your mind you don't want to watch a brute video and waste your time that's why you can straight away go into the optimal section and the videos are broken the videos are not up 40 minutes the videos are broken into 5 minutes next to 10 minutes next to 15 minutes so we are saving your time over here don't have to scroll and figure out the chapter and other things we are saving a time saying this is an optimal approach you can straight away watch it because you know the problem you know the examples don't waste time over there straight away watch the optimal approach and what additionally we have done is we have written intuitions and the intuitions are related to real life examples we don't want to give you you know very standard stuff you know step one run a all loop step two do this we are relating every approach every approach to a real life example and this is how the intuition looks like and then we go across to the approach and after that we have have images yes we have images that explains it so imagine you're revising or you're doing similar stuff where you don't want to spend time on a video you could read it read the entire editorial you'll understand everything then you can literally explore the images the images do a dryon so that you can understand the approach and once that is done you could head over to the bottom and you will get the code as well you'll get the entire working code which works with int main and if you just want the functional code you can say simply paste the function as well and you get code support in all the four languages you want to display the code in an entire big model you can do that as well okay understood what if i want to do a complexity analysis we have done detailed complexity analysis now this is an array problem but if you look at the graph problems and other problems we've literally gone deep if if you're using something like n sare plus n log n plus n we've literally told you why are we using n square why n log and why and we've done every bit of thing over there and same with space complexity this is the ultra premium editorial section why do i call it because this are my videos the videos i think everyone knows how good our videos are taking forward i don't have to vouch for it everyone knows it that is why we do get 6 million views that is for a reason so you basically watch it and you can track your submissions over here and then you can head over to the doubt section what i'll go is i'll just copy paste this one so i'll go to the next question which is missing number and this is where you can track your submissions that you did and then you go to the doubt section so we have a different version of the doubt section because i have a vision in my mind this is v1 this is version one i have a vision in mind i'll be telling you what the vision is just give you a glimpse of it and you'll understand how many things are coming in v2 you'll understand by that vision itself so imagine i have a issue with this code uh maybe what i'll do is i'll remove this because i know this will be wrong okay and i'll just copy paste the entire code and then i'll go over here and i'll say okay can you just paste this code and then what i'll do is i'll maybe i'll start writing something yeah can you please help me where i am going wrong and then there is a post doubt which allows me 20 doubts for a day so typically you can sol solve 20 problems and for every doubt you can you know counter questions on that thread so you can have 20 problems like where you can ask doubts the reason we have limited this is very simple because ai is expensive everyone knows ai is very very expensive right the models take cost and because we are offering at a very very lower market price we'll have to keep this in mind and the other reason is we don't want you to be over dependent on ai we don't want you to do everything just because of ai over here you're here to learn please focus on your learning experience rather than you know sticking to a so what happens is we basically ask this question for some reason i think i was not able to paste it properly but anyways it it fixes me yes it tells me so you don't have to wait for a ta over here again this is trained on our entire data set so if you're asking questions related to the question related to the question only it will be answering again uh you could literally continue the thread but it will make sure that you're asking questions on this question only i will not recommend you to use this that much the reason being being dependent on ai is not good when you are learning something try to avoid this as much as possible got it and there is something as post forum as well if you have an wonderful solution you could literally paste it over here and you could just tell to the audience that hey maybe my write up is better we are welcoming that as well the vision behind using ai and a public community is to months down the line when we will have 100 500s of comments on every question we can actually summarize that for you and we can say that hey you know these are the top 10 doubts that people have when they solve this particular question so this is v2 this is a sneak peek into v2 we are developing it because we don't have the user data as of now so a lot of features are dependent on user data on v2 you'll come across to the doubt section you have a section which says these are the common doubts that people are facing and you can just read through it and instead of reading through 100 comments that is what you do in other discussion forums other providers you can feel free to copy this idea so the next section is the notes section so what will happen is you could go to the notes section we have a rich editor over there so you can literally paste images you could literally you know customize your self notes and you can click on the save button so once you have clicked on save button you could head over to home where you can actually track your entire progress yes you can track your entire progress and this is where all of your notes will be visible so you don't have to you know go here and there all of your notes will be visible over here as well again a sneak peek into v2 if you have saved a lot of notes in v2 what you'll get is the moment you click you know download all we'll be combining all of them into a pdf and we will be giving you that so that you can revise in a quick manner again because we don't have a data as of now so we're not focusing on on this but eventually couple of months down the line you will also get this feature perfect so let's get back to aries by the way you can track your progress on home over here you can track what uh rank you are at you'll come to the rank thing progress you can track your submissions over here i've kept it very clean and simple right okay so you can go back to aries so once you've solved all the question we have something as contest so you can click on the contest and you can solve three unseen problem problem s and once you have done it you can check out the editorial over there as well but after the contest is completed now this is for every topic this as of now is under testing so this will be out in couple of weeks and we're not rolling it out as of now because people will be starting to learn so we're taking couple of uh weeks time and then we'll be rolling out all the contest problems right perfect so this is how the entire learning experience is just not videos i'm repeating it is just not videos it's a lot more than that okay coming back to the small small attention to details we have something as a real life implementation what you get is for every dsa problem we tell you where this is used for an example if i go to this one i actually like this one so if you read the point number three it says it is relating you to a netflix kind of a thing so you have solved a dsl problem now you're watching netflix you can actually relate it to the outside world that okay this is where software engineers might be using it under the hood also you have gone one step ahead and we are giving some amazing customer support if you are a tf plus member you click the dislike button it will be disliked if you want to give a feedback it's fine if you don't uh want to you can cross it over we ask you where did you find an issue problem editorial we have a separate team for each of them imagine you say we have a tech issue you select your priority please please do not select a high priority if it's a spelling mistake please you need to understand you know bugs which have a higher priority will take higher precedence so yeah if you can select a high priority then we take the description the problem name and then you could simply write whatever problem you are facing and you can submit it and our team responds within 24 to 72 hours if it's a a big bug if it's a small bug we usually resolve it within 24 hours so again we are taking care of everything it's not that you have an issue and you don't know where to say you report it to us and whenever you report a bug you'll be able to see it under your home section under submissions and you'll get the status if it is resolved or if it is not so you can test it back and if it is not you can again raise the same bug perfect so that is for the entire learning experience okay did i miss out on something let me go back and check it across so we have real life implementation we have completed ed tutorials submissions out okay by the way four langage support as i kept on saying this you can go full screen you can reset you can go to the previous next done everything is taken care of what if uh a day i want to you know learn about something known as linear search so you can literally write linear search over here and you can straight away head over to that problem so you don't have to search over here any algorithm that comes up in an online assessment and you want to brush through it you can straight away do it as well you kept that in mind mind as well perfect and going forward in future we are building a v2 over here which is a recommendation engine where you click and it will ask you maybe you want problems around you know dynamic programming on grits so you can tell me hey can you give me additional problems on dynamic programming apart from what you have over here it's going to give you it's going to give you those problems and eventually with v3 we'll be setting up those problems as well that's the vision it is we're not building a course you're building something out of the box over here got it so that was about the course section what if you want to communicate with me yes we have live sessions on boarded as well so you could head over to the session and you will see sessions over there it's a demo right because i'm just recording a video so you can enroll for the session and we' have kept one thing in mind we don't want a crowd of 5,000 people for that reason we will have an upper cap we'll decide it on the basis of enrollments we'll have an upper cap and i'll say let's much so a session will be there it'll be just let's say for 500 people or 300 people and once that is filled we again will put out one more session for 500 then one more session for 500 if we have a lot of people i will take six sessions separately i don't want a chaos in my meetings i want it to be very personalized i want to take everyone's st for that reason again attention to detail has been provided before the session you could post your doubt over here and we'll be answering the most like like doubts because most lik doubts eventually means most people are facing it so we'll be answering that once you've done this you know the sessions will be uploaded over here so you can access it from here and the chapters will be added on those sessions so that you can watch your relevant doubt part got it that was about the weekly sessions who will be taking the weekly sessions i will be taking it there are industry leaders will be taking it there are people who are working at multinational companies that will be taking it we'll be bring in a lot of people on these sessions if you tell me hey raj can you please teach dynamic programming once more i'll be doing that as well over the weekends so we have an one on one interaction rather like a zoom interaction where we meet every weekend so you can get your uh queries answered okay we have a discussion forum let's go back to it so this is a discussion forum we've tried to build a community we're trying to build a community over here and eventually yes eventually we would have a lot of ai integrated at this section where you know we have a lot of discussions throughout the day but you don't have time to go through a lot of discussions in the day so what you could do is you can click on the ai and say hey what are the important things so it will just rank you these are the top most important things according to your preference if you say rank it according to you know fun so it will just rank it the fun ones rank it according to referals you'll do it according to referals rank it according to you know finding study groups it will do you you don't have to scroll and find it again competitors you can build a product idea i'm just laying out the idea so you can just take it across i don't mind uh this is what you will be building and uh sorry this is what you'll be copying rather uh notification so every time someone replies anything happens you get a notification as well said that we have a dark mode and we have a light mode as well this this hurts my eyes at least and is this no we have a lot of other things you can get a certificate but we want our certificate to be valued we don't want our certificate to be like we just pay us and we give you no you solve 80 of the entire section you get the certificate otherwise you don't get as simple as that perfect uh report a bug uh you can literally report a bug anything outside of course as well become an affiliate i'll come to that claim cash back i'll come to that perfect all of this how much is the cost also we will be adding a section in uh 3 weeks time where you'll find over here mock contest so once youve done everything i have five mock contest which you can give which will have randomized questions from different topics so this is also in pipeline a lot of other v2 features are in pipeline i'll just uh name some of them they're coming up with objectoriented programming as well inside plus where you get uh video lectures write ups quiz everything they're coming up with course subjects over there we will not be attaching videos because it's more like a theory part which you have to read through we'll try to give you as compact notes as possible again followed by quiz there's a lot of other features uh we'll have a daily streak we'll have a ai summarizer of the video imagine you don't have a time to watch the entire video i'll give you a summary of it and whatever section you want because we can put chapters but you might need something else what we are thinking so we're going to put an ai summarizer over there so you can know at what time stamp what i'm teaching so you can straight away jump to it that is something we are building in house as well and yeah that's that's fair bit of it there's a couple of other features which i don't want to disclose because they're like gold dust so i'll not be disclosing it but most of the things will be launching in v2 which is in october and anyone who is enrolling now will get access to it as well you don't have to pay anything extra okay quick question hey so many features literally so many what is the price point of first of all what's the market price everyone is selling at around 5k 7k but they are just offering zoom classes right and no one has their own product most of them do not have their own product they have a third party app and if you focus on everyone's video no one shows their platform they say we're going to help you crack this crack this crack that and if you have seen this entire video there's not a single time i have mentioned any of the companies ter because our entire focus is to make sure you upskill you get so good you get so good that you can literally clear any of those things any of the interviews i i don't care i'm teaching you for the best so that you're prepared for the rest got it so what is the price point i've thought about it a lot of times and i've decided that i'll be keeping it extremely pocket friendly if you don't trust my words you can opt in for a course at a net tech organization that is offering such a platform experience along with video courses you'll be seeing that they're charging you around 2 lakh rupes to 3 lakh rupees we have a similar platform experience we have a course with videos we have an entire experience given to you and i can vouch for the video qualities they are way way better than what the other organizations are offering a lot of times people who are enrolling for these expensive courses they're still ending up watching my videos on youtube so that is where our quality stands upon and we are offering couple of plans the first plan is for a validity of one year and the second plan is for a validity of 3 years but if you are an early member of take forward plus you can use the coupon code tf plus while purchasing it the validity will be lifetime till how long is the coupon code valid it is valid for i'm not sure how long we might just revoke this coupon code tonight itself or maybe tomorrow the moment we see that we're getting you know significant amount of enrollments we will be revoking it because we want it to be exclusive the lifetime community i want that to be exclusive and i want them to be our early members right in the first one uh like in the validity onee subscription plan you'll not be getting ai doubt support and the weekly sessions with me while in the lifetime of the threee validity thing you'll be getting everything and whatever v2 features that are coming by in october 1 week everything yes everything will come under the same subscription you don't have to pay anything extra if you're opting for the you know the later subscription which is for lifetime and this coupon code is giving you the maximum discount that is possible and this coupon code will be taken back on sunday midnight on sunday midnight the prices will rise slightly slightly or somewhere around that so this is about the price point so if you compare this price point totech organization it has extreme pocket friendly if you compare this price point to other people who are just providing you zoom classes it is lesser than that as well and we are offering you so much more like i think there is literally no comparison over there as well coming to other thing uh can you actually get it at a much lower price you can we have a cashback dashboard all you need to do is head over to linkedin once you've used our platform definitely head over to linkedin write a post about your experience it can be bad it can be good just give your pointless if you're feeling that okay at this price point this is amazing write about that if you feel that no it's not good right about that as well as long as you're giving us a constructive feedback because we are building something over here we're not over here to stay for a month we building it and this is our long term vision so give us a proper feedback can be good we like good so try to be positive and you can add payment details over here a 5 additional cash back will be transacted into your account this offer is valid for lifetime yes this is something whenever you purchase you'll get this cash back stuff and we'll be you know submitting the cash back by the end of the month but we have one more plan which is become an affiliate now this is open for everyone you have been referring take it forward to your juniors to your colleagues to everyone correct till date but you're not being paid for that you have come up with this affiliate you're refering take you forward why don't you add your payment details get a coupon code and refer the link that you have and our systems will make sure if the person has come to take you forward by your link for the next 15 days for the next 15 days if he purchases tf plus you will get your affiliate commission and that is 15 of whatever the user pays us it's minus gst obviously minus gst because gst is not our money so that is what you'll get so if you're a member of tf plus if you refer six people or seven people yeah i think tf plus will be free for you yeah that is about the affiliate plan so considering the cash back the affiliate plan i think this is extremely pocket friendly okay uh before i move on to one more very very important thing a huge shout out to our team a huge shout out to our team that you're seeing on the screen everyone has given their literally everything for the last 3 months you're seeing an entire product right a lot of engineers have left their job but still they're using third party platforms not able to build something of this ster just just pause and think y\",\n          \"so let's continue with our stack and q playlist for starting off he welcome back to the channel i hope you guys are doing extremely well so the problem that we will be solving today is sliding window maximum so what is the problem statement stating that you'll be given an ums aray you will be given a value of k now your task is to start with the first window of the size k so over here you start with the first window of size k and you get the maximum out of it so what will be the maximum that will be three of the first window of size k perfect if i ask you what is the next window now this was the window which one is the next window can i say if i slide it by one place this will be the next window which is typically this one and what is the maximum unit again three so you write a three so i can say that in this particular window the maximum is three again you go to the next window so if i have to go to the next window can i say that this is my next window so i'll end up just erasing this i'll have the new window as this one what is the maximum can i say five i again and if i ask you what is the next window i can just slide it and this will be my next window so i'm at my new window now what is the maximum five again i slide it this time this will be my new window can i see this yes i can so i can erase it what is the maximum again five again make sure you move to the next window which is this one so if i move to the next window what is the maximum the maximum is three again i can say move to the next window which is this one so i can just erase the current window and move to the next and the maximum is six after that i don't have any other window and if i don't have any other window me stop so if you try out all the windows of three you will get a maximum of from each of these windows you store them in a list or an array and that is what you will be returning so what is the na solution to this one i know one thing for sure we start from index zero and we could straight away scan the next k elements after that we move to the next index and again scan the next you know three elements or k elements and again move to the next and again scan three again move to the next and again scan three again move to the next and scan three and so on i can go on till here because this is where i'll get the last three elements if i have to write down the indexes it's 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 till sixth index is where i'll go for n equal to 9 so that's 9 3 9 k is where i'll go to okay i know that for short so what i'll do is i'll keep keep a list where i'll store all the answer and i'll start by saying okay i can traverse from i equal to 0 till n minus k because that is where till i can generate all the windows i can store a maximum and i can say that the maximum initially will be array of i i know the elements will be from i equal to how many if i say this is 0o this is 1 2 so i take till k elements which is nothing but 0 3 1 which is nothing but i kus 1 can i say this i can because if i is here i k one so i'll go to i k minus one perfect and it'll be very simple maxi equal to max of maxi comma array of j that will give me the maximum of that particular window once i have it you could do a list. add or whatever language you're using you could just push the maxi to it and once you're done you could end up returning the list and that's it so what will be the time complexity i can say that this is running for b go of n minus k for sure i can say that this is running for beo of k so the overall time complexity will be n minus k multiplied with k for sure b of n minus k multiplied with b of k what about the space complexity i'm running it for n k because till n minus k because i have n minus k windows so i can say the number of windows will be equal to the number of maximum size tool that'll be the size of the list so n minus k is the size of the list perfect so this is where the interview will not be happy because you're running a nested loop kind of a you know algorithm they'll ask you to optimize this so we need to optimize our brute force solution and the brute force what i was doing was i was scanning through each and every window and that is the reason i ended up taking quadratic time complexity and the interviewer is asking you to optimize a somewhere near about b of end time complexity that means it's an indication that you should start looking at a beo of end time complexity which means i'll have to solve it while doing a single traversal while doing a single traversal can i do it what was i doing previously i was going through each and every window and then i was scanning through it to get the maximum what if i say that hey maybe i can just travers maybe i could just travers and keep a track of k elements how will i do that it's simple yes yes yes yes but when you add minus three you are having four elements with you so you just trim it off after that when you have five you trim after that when you have three you trim after that when you have seven you you trim after that when you have one you trim so every moment you're keeping a track of k elements so the first priority is you know tracking like keep a track of key elements like keep like just keep the window elements don't keep anything outside keep the window elements that's the track keep the window elements perfect so which means whenever i'm at seven i'll add it i'll add it and at the same time i'll delete it so i need a data structure which adds and you know throws out the outside perfect what else i need imagine i'm at this particular place which is 537 and i need the maximum in order to get the maximum i'll have to scan through each and every element in that window and that is what was taking time so i cannot scan through i cannot scan through this is where i'll use the concept of monotonic stack i'll explain you it's very simple and i'll be like i'll be storing elements in a decreasing order why decreasing order as i go through in the dryon you'll start understanding why decreasing order how did i end up understanding that it is a monotonic stack you have to do you know a bit of here and there you'll have to do play around with pen and people then it will start coming to your brain it will take time but if you have the knowledge of monotonic stack you should implement whenever you need the greatest or you need the smallest you know in constant complexity whenever you need greatest or smallest in constant you should think of monotonic st got it okay so i know one thing i need to keep the window elements that means i need to add and i need to delete i need to add from the front i need to delete and in order for monotoring stack i need just a stack i need a data structure stack i need a data structure which kind of you know adds and deletes i need a two way data structure like something which is you know open from both the ends so that i can i can add and i can delete okay so do i use a stack and a data structure for k elements no i use a single data structure and that is nothing but the w dq my bad maybe i can write something like this so this is the dq data structure so what this allows is this allows you to you know push from the back this allows you to pop from the back and this is what acts as your stack you could always push back that is similar to you know stack dot push and you can pop back that is pretty much similar to pop in stack okay and what you could do is you could also push front you could also push front and you could also pop front white simple now this is what will be required to take out elements because you'll be taking out elements every time you move so this is a data structure where the right end can be used as a stack and the left hand left side could be used to know remove elements so what i've done is i've drawn the dq yes but i've kept it open so that you know that from the top we insert stack elements and from the bottom you could always remove elements so this is a dq which is going to store index and values not values values is just for your reference so what i will be doing is i'll be starting with the first element right and that is one index zero and the dq doesn't have anything so you could simply just push back in this stack so it'll be like zero the next with a value of one value is just for reference i'll be moving to this one so when you are at the index one first thing you have to keep in mind is is are you storing anything outside window remember the window is something here so it's still not storing like you storing zero index it is still not outside your window of size three say okay but you have a three you have a three and as i told you we will be maintaining a monotonic stack which is decreasing in nature so i have a three now tell me one thing if you have a three is there a point because i'm looking for maximum is there a point of storing one no there's no point of storing one because if you have a three this literally no point of storing one this is where you'll say that hey listen can you just you know go out okay he's gone so i'll be storing index one and a value three perfect after that i'll be coming to minus one so when i come to you know minus one i'll be like this is my window this is my window so look at the stack stack is having element one right that's the last element that we have and that is okay that is inside the window because the window ends at zero that is inside the window so the window we are still carrying the you know correct window what is the next thing we have a minus one now you might say that hey we have a three why will we store minus one i'll tell you why imagine this isus 5 and when the window is this much tell me which is the maximum 5 is not max maximum minus one is maximum so you'll have to store minus one because when three is gone when three is gone you need the next you need the next greatest element got it that's why i'm storing like this 3 minus one so when three is gone still have minus so what you'll do is you'll take that minus one which is at index two and you'll put it in so we are storing in a monotonic decreasing fashion if you see which is like this no not like this like this monotonic decreasing fashion perfect what is the next so before going next you are at your first window size so can you get me the maximum yes because i'm storing in an increasing fashion you could straight away get the element from the back you know from the front in dq this is front inq this is front so you could straight away get from the front so i'll get the element and that is three so i can straight away write the element three after that i'll move here so when i move here again i'm at three i know the window is still one is it valid yeah the last element is still valid so i can keep it so i have a minus three can i put it into the stack yes i can because even if i put it it still maintains a decreasing order and the index is three if i want because i want the maximum because this is new window i want the maximum for it so again you look at the front element and that's three so you could just pick it up next you go to four so when you go to the fourth index you know this this is where you are this is where you are correct till second is what you can allow so at max one element will go up from the stack which is the last element so you could go and do a pop front you could go and do a pop front so this will go you could easily take it out right that's why you need a dou ended q perfect so i've taken it out so i'm maintaining the the window now what is the next thing i need the greatest tell me if you have five if you have five do you actually need minus three do you actually need minus one no that's where you end up first deleting this then deleting this and eventually entering the fifth element which is at index 4 so now you are again at a window and if i ask you what is the maximum you look at the front element which is five so you see that five is my and then you go across here so when you go across here first thing is maintain the key elements so you'll be like okay which is the last three and this is still four it is inside my window what's the next you got three so you could straight away say that okay i can just keep the lower element and i can write the index as five perfect and if i ask you for this window which one is the maximum you'll again look at and you'll see that five is the maximum so you'll take five after that you'll move across now this is where you get seven so when you get seven you're like hey listen i don't need three i don't need five but before that please make sure this is where you are this is where you are okay and this is the last in index of the window and this is still valid you don't have to remove now you're looking for seven seven is very big so what you'll do is you take this out here'll take this out everyone is gone i take the window six and the value seven and for this window the answer will be seven after that we coming across to one so you could just keep on doing this process very simple very very simple so what i'll do now is i'll write down the pseudo code so you have to write down the function and the the function will be having an array and a value k what do i need to return i need to return a list right so i can define a list and what will be that like what will be the size of the list can i say this number of you know number of maximums of windows will be n minus we already did it these many windows we'll have so you can define a list of that size perfect now what you can do is you can also define a dq i'll start traversing from i equal to 0 till nus1 what the first thing you'll do we'll check hey if there's someone who is not in my window so let's go back imagine you're standing at 5 and you know the window is valid till three which is typically 5 minus k which is three that gives you two so if anyone is equal to two or anything under two anything equal to or under two so you'll be taking it out so you'll be like hey listen i know at max there can be one element because when you're adding one you'll always remove one from the back you'll be like hey listen if the dq is not empty please always check it please always check it if the dq is not empty and and the dq do back is lesser than equal to very important the current index minus k that's the case hey you can't stay by the way dq do front not back dq front not back you could say that dq do po front perfect so it be just taking it out so made sure that it is maintaining the correct window elements what is the next job to make sure that we maintain greater elements so be like okay i need to maintain greater elements so maybe i could do a while stack. mt not stack dq mt and and we playing with stack like we're playing with dq which is treated as stack so it'll be like hey array of dq dot back if that value you know is lesser than but you can say lesser than equal to because there's no point in storing the same elements as well array of i do i need to store it no this is when you say dq do pop back so you throw out you end up throwing out everything and once you have throw like thrown out everything you basically end up saying dq do push because this is where you push i very important you push i not the element and after this where does your first window start remember the first window starts at k minus one so if your window has started which means if i is greater than equal to k minus one then your list will have an answer to add and what will be that answer that answer will be array of dq dot front because the stack is maintaining a monotonic order the last element so the last element is front and that will be your answer perfect and i could say that the follow loop is over and eventually i could end up returning the list and the function is over so now it's time to analyze the time complexity can i say this that this is definitely taking a b go of n and then what i'm doing is i'm popping out i'm taking it out i'm pushing elements so at max at max i'll end up pushing n elements so at max even if i'm popping it out it'll be n times so even if the while loop if i combine everything because what they're doing is you know taking elements out if i pushed n elements if i pushed n elements the maximum they can take out as n elements thereby this will be b go of n overall as nothing else so what i can say is the time complexity is b go of 2 n because n for traversal and n pop backs n put pulling out elements what about the space complexity at any moment in the dq i'm not storing more than k elements i'm just storing the window size elements plus i need the answer so that's a n minus k n minus k for the list because they storing the answer as well this will be the overall time complexity and the space complexity for this particular solution i hope youve understood it so if you're still now watching and if you've understood everything please please do consider giving us a like and if you're new to our channel do consider subscribing to us as well with this i'll be wrapping up this video let's me some other video why careen don't forget your golden i will find\",\n          \"so let's continue with our playlist today for starting off. avery, welcome back to the channel. i hope you guys are doing extremely well. so the problem that i will be solving today is lru cache. so what is the problem statement? you'll have to design a data structure that follows the constraints of a least recently used cache. so what you have to do is you'll have to implement lru cache class that implements the constructor where it is taking the capacity and initializing the lru cache to that capacity. that means it cannot store more values than the particular capacity. after that you'll have to implement a get functionality which is taking the key and you'll have to return the value of the key which is stored in the cache and if it is not stored you end up returning minus one. after that you'll have to implement the void put functionality where you'll be given a key you'll be given a value. so imagine if your cache already has the key you just update the value to that key done. what if it doesn't have in that case you'll have to add the key value pair to the cache. what if the capacity is full and you cannot add it? in that case, you delete the least recently used key and then you add this particular key and value given to you. everything like the get and put functionality has to run in a b of one average time complexity throughout. okay, let's understand this with an example. so the first thing is you have a cache of a size four as to put 2a 6. so the cache is empty. you could end up adding 2a 6 where 2 is the key, six is the value. as to put 4a 7, you can again do it because the cache is still having a size. 8a 11 you can still add it. 7a 10 you can still add it. remember you need to keep a track of the least recently used and i'm keeping a track by maintaining this particular order. the last one that was used was 2a 6. the the recent one was this one 7 10 because i just entered it. okay. after that get two. so the value is six. you can you could easily figure out from here. but this one is used. so what you'll do is you'll take it and place it at the front because this is now used recently. okay, get eight. so the value of 8 is 11. so you could return 11 and at the same time what you could do is you could take 8 11 and you could place it at the front because this is least recently used. done. after that you have a put of 5a 6. put of 5a 6. can you put it into the cache? first of all, five is not there. so you cannot replace the value. can you put it into the cache? no, you cannot because the cache already has four elements and that is the maximum capacity it can hold. so what you will be doing is you'll be like okay i need to delete. so you always delete the last one that is 4a 7 goes off just goes off. so you've deleted it. what next? you take 5a 6 and you put it over here. so this is my cache as of now. so i'm done with this. after that i'm asked to get seven. so what's the value of seven? 10. so can i say that this is somewhere here and it will go over here because this is least recently used. after that i will put 5a 7. do i have a five in the cache? i do have. i do have. so what i'll do is first of all i'll take this five put it first and then i'll take off the six i'll say what's the new value seven replace it and done so this will maintain the order of least recently used but i'm done dusted so this is what we need to implement it's not something that you'll have to solve you'll have to have knowledge of doubly link list and map data structure so typically linkless and hashing is all you need to know. in case you don't know it, please stop the video as of now. go back and watch my link list. go back and watch my hashing playlist. you'll understand what a map does and how double link list like how addition in dlink list works, how deletion in dlink list works. all of these things are very very important because this is a extremely implementationheavy problem. so in order to solve this particular problem, i'll be using a doubly link list where every node will be storing the key and value. so key and value and the next pointer and the previous pointer. again, i'm assuming you know what is a doubling. under that assumption, i will be solving this particular problem. along with this what i will be doing is i'll be typically defining a map data structure. now this map data structure will be storing the key and the node position. remember the node address. why? you'll understand as we go across. so to start off what you will be doing is we'll be straight away taking a head. so this will be a dummy head. it stores minus1 minus one. so this is my dummy head. you'll be taking a dummy tail as well. it is also storing a minus one minus one. and the dummy head's previous is pointing to null. but the next is pointing to tail. remember this the dummy tail. so the dummy tail's previous is pointing to head and the next is pointing to null. so this is how initially my configuration will look like with an empty map data structure. so we start off with the first thing which is the capacity for. so maybe i can just store the capacity to be four. done. after that the first functionality like the first operation is put of 2, 6. first thing you'll do is you'll be like okay can i put it across? yeah i do. i can because the capacity is four. so i can definitely put it across. does it have it already? because if it has already do i have to replace it but it is not there. how do i know it? i can have a hashing kind of a thing which tells me if two is there or not. it tells me if two is there or not. so i definitely know two is not there. so i just need to put it across. so what you'll do is you'll say hey insert it. insert it. so you'll go ahead and say insert it. so you'll be inserting right after head. remember this. you'll be inserting right after head. so you will make something like this. what i'll do is just to you know ease out going forward. i'll just insert it right after head over here. so, insert 2, 6 over here. and i'll make sure because this is a doubly linked list. i'm asking it to be inserted right after head. so, i make sure that the next is pointing to tail and this continues. so, basically what happened is heads next is now pointing to this. i inserted it in between and imagine this is at some random address. so, i'll be storing two comma the address of it. the address of it the address is a reference to where this particular value is perfect after that when as to insert 4a 6 i'll again do the same thing i'll say okay can i go ahead and insert 4a 6 so i'll take 4 6 and i'll insert it so the next will be pointing here the previous will be pointing here the next and the previous again done and please make sure you insert 4 6 4 comma the node location after that 8 comma 11 again 8 is not there that means i'll have to insert it so i go ahead and say 8 is not there can you please insert it so the value is 8a 11 so i take 8 11 and i insert it and the previous is here this is there this is there perfect after that there's a 7a 10 but for this please make sure 8 comma address is going into your hashing hashmap after that there is 7a 10 so what i will be doing is i'll be again checking in the hash dash up it's not there so i'll be inserting it. so i take that value and i say hey 7a 10 and the next this and this 7 comma address. okay. after that i've been asked to get to i've been asked to get to. so when i've been asked to get to what i will do first of all is i'll go into the map and i'll say okay two where are you? he says hey i'm here. i'm like give me a value. so i have the node. so i could just do a node dot value. it'll give me the value. so the value is six. i'll easily get the value. but we need to keep a track of least recently used. so all i need to do is all i need to do is first of all i need to delete it. keep it in mind. delete. delete. you know how to delete in a double link list to delete the given node. so i've deleted the given node. i'll have to insert it at the front. i'll have to insert it at the front. so what i can do is quickly just take it across just move it back and i could take the new one which is 2a 6 and i'll put it over here. so it's a deletion and an insertion. it's a deletion and an insertion at the front. done. after that i've been asked to get eight. i'll again go and check if eight is there. it says yes 8 is there. it points me where it is. so i get the value which is 8a 11. so 8a 11 i get the value 11. so once i've got the value what do i do? i basically do one thing which is i say hey listen this is no more here. there's no more here. can you basically go ahead and put it at the front? i'm like why not? i'll put it at the front which is 8 11. so i put it at the front. please make sure that you reuse the nodes. don't create new nodes because if you create new nodes you'll have to update the map and that will add to extra time complexity. try to reuse the nodes. right? perfect. so okay again done. after that i've been asked to put five, six. so i go ahead and check on the map. do i have a five? i don't have a five. i don't have a five and i see that the map has four elements which is equal to the capacity. so i already have four elements. i need to take off the last one. i need to take off the last one. can i take off the last one? super simple. i get the last node. how do you get the last node? you have a tail. you have a tail. so you say, hey, who's your last? so i say tail dot previous is the node that i need to delete. tail. is the node that i need to delete. okay, please delete it. so first you delete from here. so the value is four. so go in the map and say where's four? so delete four as well. so i've deleted this. so now the double link list looks like this. correct. so maybe i could just, you know, move it across just to make it easy. so i've moved it across. now what do i need to do? i need to take the five, create a new node. so i've created a new node 5, 6. and make sure the next is pointing to the next one. and this is this. and this is as it is. so i have a five. and please make sure to store the reference to this five. no. done. after that, i've been asked to, you know, get seven. do i have a seven? yeah, i do have a seven. where is the seven here? i get the value at first which is 10. after that, what i do is i take this particular node itself. i take this particular node itself. i take it off. my bad. so 7, 10. so i'll take 7a 10. so if i take it off, uh this thing will go back and 7a 10 will come across here. 7a 10 and the next and the previous. i'm just taking it out and putting it at front. okay, done. after that, there's a question of putting five, 7. so, what i do is i go ahead and check. hey, is there a five? he says, yeah, yes, there is a five. yes, there is a five. like, okay, i just need to replace it. so, i get the reference. so, i just pick pick out the node. please make sure you pick out the node. so, i'll just pick out uh her. i will just pick out the 5, 7 node. make sure it's the same node. make sure it is the same node. so, you pick out the 5, 7. so, once you've picked it out, it will look something like this. insert the same node. take the same node and insert it over here. so the reference doesn't changes. you just change pointers. you just change pointers. get the node, delete it. get the node, delete it. and after that, insert. insert. done. perfect. so time to write down the pseudo code. so please, please make sure you should be knowing what a doubly link list is. so if i get back to the dry run, what all do we need? we definitely need a map data structure so that we can have the key and the direct reference to the node. so if you observed you did observe one thing we were deleting nodes like we had a reference we deleted and what did deletion mean over here? we were just changing links we were just changing links but the node was as it is because we're reusing that node. we're not creating new nodes. okay we could delete from here as well. so that is typically something like this. so deletion of a node is what we need. so what i could do is i could write a function deletion of a node of a given node a deletion of a node where you take a node and you end up deleting it. so you're given a node and you end up deleting it. that node can be anywhere. it can be here. it can be at the end. can be anywhere. okay. so that is something i definitely need from doubly link list. so assume we know it because i've already done this thing in the doubly link list lectures. please go back and watch it. how to delete a node whenever the reference is given. what else do we need? whenever we are deleting we're kind of using it and in order to mark it as the least recently used what we are doing is we putting it right after head right after head. so what i can do is i can say insert after head and again you'll be given a node. again you'll be given a node. so you just have to insert after head. now if if you're able to write these two functions i think my job is done. my job is done. and please make sure the doubly uh link list that you define it should be storing a key a value a next pointer and a previous pointer. so the code is given below like you can find the code in any given language. it's it's given below. what i'll recommend you to do is open it on some other tab so that you could follow across whatever i am doing. so as of now just remember you have a function deletion of a node insert after head and the node is containing a key a value a next and a previous right. so let's get on to the code. i'll be writing down the pseudo code. so we have a class which is l ru cache. what all do we need? we definitely need a map data structure. so a map which is storing a integer and the node reference star for c . for java people you don't have to give a star and a map. we also need the capacity where we know how many like what's the size of the cache. along with this we definitely need a head and a tail. why do we need it? as i implement, you'll understand. so, we'll definitely need this head and the state, right? okay. after this, we'll have to uh write across the constructor which is taking a capacity. so, what i can do is i can say the capacity this is underscore equal to capacity underscore. that is done. i could always say initially the map will have no elements. so you could just clear it across and i can always say initially the heads next will be pointing to tail and the tails previous will be pointing to head. so we have a small link list to start off with. perfect. this is how my lru cache will look like. that was the next function that i'll have to write. that's the get function. so let's write it. so i have to write in get where i've been given a key and and i need to find the value if it does exist. so first of all if it doesn't exist which means if the map doesn't have it the map doesn't have it. so can i say if the map doesn't have it and depending on your language you can write it. if the map doesn't have it in that scenario i know the answer will be returned minus one because it's not there. but if it does have it i definitely have a value. so what i could do is i could do a node star and a node and i could go to the map. hey map can you give me the value for the given key. so what this map will give is the map is storing if you remember reference it'll give you the entire node. it'll give you the entire node. so you have the node you definitely have the node. so at the end of the day you could return the node value because you have the reference node. we could straight away extract the value. but are we done? no, we're not done. we've touched someone. we've touched someone. now we need to put it at front because this is least recently used. so what i'll do is first of all i'll say delete the node and i'll pass on the node. remember the function that we wrote like we said that there's a hypothetical function that deletes the node. okay. once it is deleted, can i say insert after head? remember it's a dummy head. it's a dummy head and we use the same node. don't create one more node because it will be space complexity like you'll add up additional space complexity. reuse the given node itself. so i've inserted it after head. i need to do anything else. now we're done here. i just deleted it. put it across to keep a track of the least recently used. perfect. what's the next one? i need to write the put function as well. the put function will be i'll be given a key and i'll be given a value. okay, what are the cases? i know one thing for sure. if it is already existing, i just need to change it. so i'll be like, hey, does the map has it? if the map has the value key, again, depending on the language, the syntax will vary. if the map has this value key, what will i be doing? i'll be like okay maybe i can get the node nodes node and you could always say map hey map can you give me the value and the map will give you the reference to that node wherever you stored element perfect and you could straight away say node dot value can you just replace your value by the value given to us the new value perfect so we used it i've recently used it so what i do is delete node and this node would be deleted since i recently used it. i say insert after head or whatever is the function name and i insert it and we are done. yeah, we're done. no need to change anything in the map because the map is storing a reference to the node. pretty cool. what if it is not in the map? if it is not in the map, then there can be multiple conditions. what if my cache is already filled up? okay, so it means if the number of elements that i store mp dot uh size equal to capacity. if this is the case, what i'll do is i have to delete. i'll have to get rid of this guy. which guy? the least recently used. how do you figure that out? go back to the dry. this is your dummy tail that you initially defined. the least recently element is this one, which is the previous of the dummy tail, which is the previous of the dummy tail. so what i do is i simply go over and i say hey i know the node and the node is nothing but the tails previous. so i can easily get the node. okay, if i have the node i can also easily get the mp like from the map i could easily erase it. i could say mp do delete or erase whatever you have from the map. i could always say node key because i if i have the node reference i have the key. i could delete it out of the map. okay, it's gone from the map. i need to take it out from the cache as well. so i say delete node. delete the node. and since i have the node, i'll delete it. so what i've done is even if the size was full, i ended up deleting one element from it. perfect. done. what after this? if it is deleted, i have someone new. okay. if i have someone new, i'll say node star node new node or whatever is whatever you write key value. so i'll i'll create a new node. okay, this is created. and i'll say mp of key. can you store this new nodes reference? done. and after that i'll say insert after head. insert after head. and i'll pass on this node which can be inserted. and we are done. we're done here as well. okay. what is the time complexity? let's analyze. this is definitely p of fun. okay. this is also b of one. assuming the delete works in b of one, which it will because it's just a link change. insert after head, it is also a link change. it will also work in b of one. this one is something that might take b of login depending on the language that we're using, the map that you're using. so i'll just leave it to you. the put am i doing something extra wagon? am i running a loop? no. this is also big of one assuming that the map is taking b of one. we're using a map that takes login. this will end up being login depending on the language, the map, etc. you can say bo of one or po of login. so i was able to design it but then you should be able to delete the node. it's very simple. if you're given a node and if you want to delete it. so what you do is you get the previous node at first which is node.re because it is a doubly linked list. you get the after node the node after it which is node next. so once you've got it all you need to do is the previous nodes next should point to after node and the after nodes previous basic link list should point to the previous done. this is how you easily delete a node by cutting off links. okay, insert after head. you have the dummy head with you, right? you have the dummy head. so all you need to do is okay, you need to figure out as of now what is head connected to? what is head connected to? so current after head. current after head. so maybe you could write current after head. now this is nothing but head.ext. so you have it. there's the current after head. all you need to do is head. next could easily be written as node because this is the new node. so head would be pointing to it. okay. nodes next will always be pointing to the cur after head like the previous one that you had. so basically if you insert something it will be pointing to this and the previous will be pointing to this. so i made sure that the next is pointing to this and please make sure that the nodes previous is pointing to the head. done simple link changes and i'm good to go. you can find the entire code given below. this was more like a pseudo code but if you followed the entire pseudo code then going through the code that i've given below should be a cakewalk. so yeah that will be it for this one. i hope you have understood it and if you're still now watching please please do consider giving us a like and if you're new to our channel do consider subscribing to us as well. with this i'll be wrapping up this video. let's meet in some other video. till then take care. whenever your heart is broken, don't ever forget you're golden.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n
