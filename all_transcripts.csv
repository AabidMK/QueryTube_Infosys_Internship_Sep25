f_XVxYjmWj8,"Some of the challenges with notion that made me consider alternatives. A lot of it had to do with pricing going up and my team using less and less of those features. What I was looking for was to have a tool where members of my team would be empowered to make updates within their own departments without having to pay for a seat for every single person who makes updates. The migration process from notion was very seamless. It didn't require any further editing from me. So, if that hadn't been the case, it might have taken me longer to make a decision. But that sold it for me. Using Kod and Grammarly together, it's just a beautiful marriage of two tools for two work processes that are so important to my business. I can create really clear documentation. and I can catch any errors and ensure our brand style guide is implemented even in how we talk about clients and their products.",unknown

I can catch any errors and ensure our brand style guide is implemented even in how we talk about clients and their products. Hi, my name is Maddie Osman. I am the founder of the Blogsmith content agency for B2B technology brands. I was looking for a tool where members of my team would be empowered to make updates within their own departments without having to pay for a seat for every single person who makes updates. In KOD, you're only paying for the user who creates the initial documents. From there, other team members are able to edit those documents without me needing to add paid seats for the privilege. KOD empowers team members with the information that they need in order to complete their task. Whether it's client specific information, their persona documentation, and standard operating procedures. With Grammarly, we make use of the custom style guide to make it really straightforward for my team to be on the same page and not waste a lot of time on unnecessary edits. With Grammarly and KOD, my team is finally able to have an effective single point of truth for both our style rules and the essential processes that underly our content creation. [Music]",unknown
O0qdEu7VjDs,"The biggest benefit of using Grammarly in my work is that it helps me be the best writer that I can be so that I can be an effective partner for my clients. My name is Alyssa Towns and I'm a freelance writer at Words with Alyssa LLC. Prior to working with Grammarly, and I don't think I realized it at the time, my writing just wasn't always super clear. Looking back, I realized that Grammarly was not only improving my writing, but also helping me become a better and stronger writer, too. Grammarly has analyzed over 25 million words since I started using it over 5 years ago. And it's helped me maintain long-term relationships with my clients, provide high quality work to them, and prior to freelancing. It's really helped me succeed as an internal communications professional. I use paragraph rewrites, clarity suggestions, and proofreading the most in Grammarly because my secret sauce is getting that first draft down on paper, getting those initial thoughts out, and then using Grammarly to really bring it to life, clean it up, and turn it into the best version that it can be. My favorite way to use Grammarly's AI feature is to generate a starting point for longer communications to get that first draft out so that I can focus on the more strategic pieces of the communication itself. No matter your role in communications or what type of work you do, Grammarly works wherever you work and caters to you to help you be the best, most effective communicator that you can be.",unknown
WpRFs0gUYRs,"If I were to speak to my past self before using Grammarly, I would say, imagine having a personal writing assistant that not only catches embarrassing mistakes before hitting send, but also helps you articulate your ideas clearly and improves your writing skills every time you use it. My name is Stacy Rashan. I'm an educational technology consultant and author. Grammarly's AI makes me a more confident writer. With its assistance, I'm able to craft clear and more effective messages. Those who use Grammarly know it's a superstar in helping you strike the right tone, and I love the ease with which you can toggle between more friendly and more formal tones effortlessly with some of Grammarly's newer features. My favorite new Grammarly feature is paragraph rewrite. While Grammarly was great at catching errors and suggesting improvements in the past, paragraph rewrites have really taken everything up several notches. To me, it almost feels like I used to have a copy editor with Grammarly, and now I have a line editor, an assistant that improves the overall structure, flow, and coherence of my writing. I also just love the implementation of the paragraph rewrites. It's such a natural flow. I simply tap the sidebar to see suggestions there in line. I can undo any changes that I don't feel right and then I can choose to accept and continue on. I never hit send on a post without checking with Grammarly first.

1_ZczeKkduA,"Welcome to your Grammarly admin video series. As an account admin, you play a key role in setting your team up for success. These quick videos will show you how to activate Grammarly's most powerful features so your team can write with clarity, consistency, and confidence from day one. In this video, we'll show you how to set up brand tones and style rules. Two features that tailor Grammarly suggestions to match your brand's unique voice and writing standards. You are setting the tone for your entire team and we're here to make that easier. Let's start with brand tones. Teams spend countless hours manually ensuring their brand is consistently represented. What if that effort was automated? Whether your brand is casual and friendly or polished and professional, Grammarly helps reinforce that voice everywhere your team writes. You can designate brand tones that guide your team to strike the right note in every message. To get started, head to the admin panel and begin setting up your team's tone profile. We'll walk you through a few quick questions about how your brand sounds. Things like how formal, optimistic, or direct your voice should be. From there, Grammarly generates a custom tone profile based on your responses. You can fine-tune it further by searching for, adding, or removing tones so it reflects exactly how you want your team to sound across different channels. Once you've saved your settings, these tones will instantly start informing your team's writing, providing real-time tone suggestions that help them stay on brand. Next up, style rules. Through this feature, you can define how your team should refer to key terms, follow inclusive language and compliance standards, or avoid off-brand language. For example, if your team should always use full product names in external messages, never acronyms or abbreviations, you can set that as a rule that will surface and correct them as they write. To create a new rule, head to the style rules tab in the admin panel. From there, you can add individual rules or upload a list of all of your rules at once. You can add explanations for each rule so your team understands the context behind the suggestions. And you can even share a link for team members to learn more. Grammarly surfaces these rules in real time so your team gets brand specific writing guidance exactly when they need it. Once everything's set, tone and style suggestions appear automatically across your team's everyday tools like Google Docs, KOD, email, Slack, Microsoft Teams, and more. It's an easy way to keep your brand voice strong and your team aligned. No extra effort or training required. Grammarly's AI assistant for work is here to support your team and help your brand shine through and every word. Ready to get started? Head to the admin panel to set up brand tones and style rules today.",unknown
CNDU5v7B_FU,"[Music] Welcome back to your Grammarly admin video series. In this video, you'll learn how to invite users to Grammarly using a variety of methods from quick manual invites to more automated and secure options that integrate with your internal systems. No matter how your organization is set up, we've got you covered. Let's start with single signon or SSO. SSO allows your team to log into Grammarly using your preferred identity provider like Octa or Microsoft Entra ID. It keeps things easy for your team with no extra passwords to remember and gives your IT team greater control over access and security. To set it up, you or your IT team will first need to add Grammarly to your identity provider. From there, fill in the authentication fields in your Grammarly admin panel. test the connection and then activate it for your team. Once SSO is live, you'll get a custom login link you can share with your team to get them started. Next is SKIM provisioning which is available only on enterprise plans. SKIM stands for system for cross-domain identity management. But more importantly, it's one of the most secure and automated ways to manage user access. For example, you can give every new hire access to Grammarly the moment they join and they'll receive an invite. When skimm is enabled, new users are automatically provision based on rules you define in your identity provider. No manual steps required. If you're ready to set this up, reach out to our support team or your Grammarly account representative. We'll walk you through it. You can also invite users directly from the admin panel. Navigate to the members tab under member management and choose how you want to invite them. You can add emails manually one by one. Upload a list to add emails in bulk or copy and share an invite link. If you're already using SSO, users invited this way will simply be redirected to your SSO login page and access will only be granted if Grammarly is assigned to them through your identity provider. Once set up, admins can manage user roles and permissions anytime. Here are a few different types of users you can assign. Other account admins like you who should have full access to IT configurations, billing, and more. Account managers who can configure writing settings across teams and view usage data across the company. and users who receive writing suggestions and can view their analytics but can't make account changes. On enterprise plans, you can also set up custom roles with the exact permissions you need for each. Whether you're inviting a few teammates or rolling out Grammarly across your entire organization, you have flexible options that give you control, security, and scalability.

5wmTbiiaIuU,"[Music] Welcome back to your Grammarly admin video series. In this video, we're covering a key feature available to customers on our enterprise plan, the effective communication score or ECS. Your ECS helps you understand how strong your organization's communication is by analyzing your team's activity in Grammarly and comparing it to industry benchmarks. It's a simple way to capture the impact of Grammarly and get insight into the quality of your organization's communication. Let's walk through how to read your score and how to improve it over time. To get started, head to the team overview. Under the analytics tab within your admin panel, at the top, you'll see your organization's ECS, and just below it, you'll see what your team's score would have been without Grammarly. You'll also see a breakdown of how Grammarly has improved different aspects of your team's communication like correctness, clarity, inclusivity, style consistency, and brand compliance based on the suggestions that your team has accepted. Click on your detailed score analysis to learn how the score is calculated, how to interpret it, and how you stack up against others in your industry. This analysis gives you a more actionable picture of what Grammarly is improving and where there's opportunity to grow. For example, if your style consistency score is lower than you expect, it may be time to update and reinforce your brand style guide within Grammarly. Which brings me to a few quick ways to raise your score. Set up brand tones within Grammarly to guide your team's tone in real time and improve brand compliance across your org. Create style rules to align on preferred terms and formatting, raising your style consistency score. Invite teammates to Grammarly and streamline access by enabling single sign on to ensure everyone is communicating more clearly and accurately.

q2jR6PmLOqU,"[Music] Welcome back to your Grammarly admin video series. In this video, you'll learn how to save your team time and reduce repetitive work using two powerful tools, snippets and knowledge share. Together, they help your team access company knowledge so they can stay aligned and avoid confusion without breaking their flow. Let's start with snippets. Snippets are reusable blocks of text that your team can insert instantly using a simple keyboard shortcut instead of typing it out every time. You can create snippets for things like common customer responses, product descriptions, your brand's boilerplate, or internal updates you send on a regular basis. While each user can always create their own snippets, admins can scale this time-saving feature by creating and managing snippets at the account level to ensure everyone has access to company approved messaging. To set these up, go to the snippets tab in your admin panel. You can add snippets in two ways. Upload them in bulk using a CSV template or add them one by one just like you would with style rules. Each snippet includes a title, shortcut, and body text, which can be a few words, a sentence, or even an entire paragraph complete with links. You can always preview or edit your snippets later. Want to personalize these even further? You can assign snippets to specific groups of users with collections, so sales, support, and marketing each get what they need without extra noise. This level of customization makes it easy to support every team with relevant, reusable content. Once snippets are live, your team can use them anywhere they write. Just type the backslash key to search and insert a snippet instantly. No more copy pasting or rewriting the same message twice. Snippets help your team move faster, write smarter, and stay consistent without the extra effort. Next up, knowledge share. An easy way to reduce confusion around acronyms and team jargon. When enabled, Grammarly will automatically detect jargon in your team's writing. Users can hover over a term to see its definition, related documents, and who to contact for more context. This keeps communication clear and gives new teammates or crossfunctional collaborators easy access to information. To add terms, head to the knowledge share tab in your admin panel. From there, you can add individual terms or upload a list of all of the terms your team should know at once. You'll also find collections of preset terms you can choose from for specific industries and teams. Within each term, add a description that defines the term or acronym and link supporting materials like documentation or Slack channels. You can also assign ownership to subject matter experts so your team always knows who to contact to learn more. Once your terms are uploaded, Grammarly will automatically highlight them across the tools your team uses every day. Just make sure your team downloads Grammarly for Chrome and Grammarly for Windows or Mac to take full advantage of these features. That way, all they need to do is hover over a term to get instant clarity. Snippets and knowledge share help your team move faster, write smarter, and stay aligned without slowing down to search, retype, or clarify. Ready to save your team time? Head to your admin panel to set up snippets and knowledge share today.",unknown

N9afgFkfV1w,"[Music] Okay. >> Ready? >> Okay. Hi. So, Grammarly is a company that helps over 40 million people, including me, become better and more effective communicators. And over the past year, I know that Grammarly has leaned into generative AI to further this goal. You've launched tools like authorship, which helps users differentiate between user generated and human content, and prompting tools to help users better tailor what they're writing. So, I'm especially excited to chat with you uh on what business leaders can learn about Grammarly's AI strategy. Shashir is the new CEO of Grammarly. He recently stepped into the role. Um and before that he was the founder of productivity tool KOD and he was also responsible for leading YouTube at Google and several other tech companies uh including working at Microsoft. So Grammarly recently acquired Koda a productivity tool. Can you give us context on how that happened and what's next for Grammarly? >> Yeah, excited to be here. Uh first human X conference. Fun place to be. Um yes, so we we uh combined companies uh about two months ago now uh Emily and Kota and it all started with a really interesting meeting between the the two leadership teams where we realized our vision for the future was an interesting mixed um almost like two puzzle pieces fitting together. Um and we had this meeting in Vancouver. We sat down. We learned a lot about each other's strategies. You know, first thing I learned was Gramly is a lot bigger and different than people think. You know, Grammarly, as Luxie mentioned, 40 million daily active users use Grammarly every day to help them communicate better. It's a pretty large business, over $700 million in in revenue. Uh, that's often surprising people, but the most surprising thing about Grammarly is that the actual uh innovation has very little to do with the grammar. The heart of what Grammarly has actually built is a technology stack to bring AI agents right to where the user works. If you think about what Grammarly does in 500,000 different applications in the uh on the web, on the desktop, so on, Grammarly can read what you're doing, annotate it, and uh and change it for anything from Google Docs to Slack to Salesforce, so on. One of the analogies that the Gramly founders gave me that I really liked is that it feels like uh Grammarly built this AI superighway where we can bring agents right to the edge, but we're only running one car on that highway today. We're only running the one with your English grammar teacher in it. And part of what we wanted to do together was bring what Grammarly and Kota had been doing to fill those cars with the rest of the agents. You know, one of the things KOD is very well known for is integrating with all the different products in the world. It's one of the most popular features of Kod. And that's the sort of core idea of what we're doing is building the AI superighway to bring agents to the edge and making it possible for anybody to deploy an agent that works right alongside humans. >> Awesome. So the launch of chat GPT is considered a seminal moment in the present AI revolution. Through your experience at YouTube, Koda and now Grammarly, you've seen AI through many generations. Can you talk a little bit more about what this moment signified for you? >> Yeah, I mean it's very interesting. Obviously everybody here is sees the excitement the same way. uh you know I started my career working on the cloud uh while I was at Microsoft while that transition was happening that was amazing I then worked on YouTube when people thought what we were seeing was the video revolution but actually what we were seeing was the maker revolution that was really interesting and I spent the last 10 years working in productivity with Koda and Grammarly and I I think what we're seeing now is a dramatic shift in productivity I like to think of as the third era of productivity so maybe if you follow with me the uh you can think about productivity as three phases first phase was uh digitization. That's when we took typewriters and turned them into word processors and basically went from physical tools to digital ones. And then about 15 years ago, we went through the second era of productivity where productivity became about collaboration, about working with humans. So it went from single player to multiplayer. We saw products like Google Docs. We saw products like Slack and all these products that really took uh made it possible to work with your teammates in your in your productivity tools. And I think in this phase we're about to take the next leap and we're going to go from working with humans to working with humans and agents. And I think that's really exciting way uh uh to think about it. One one visual that that might help is today if you open any of your productivity products, Google Docs, Koda, so on, you'll see all the avatars at the top, right? Those are the those are the people you work with. Imagine a future where in all those tools, instead of having the four or five teammates you work with, you have the four or 5,000 agents that are helping you and your team be productive. And I think that's the way I like to think about productivity is we're embracing a world where our productivity tools are going to help humans and AI work together to solve problems. >> Okay, that's a great segue into my next question, which is about AI in the productivity space. Um, how do you see grammar release tools evolving and what have you already seen from users that's surprised you? >> What surprises? So, I think probably the most interesting surprise is there's so much AI hype and everybody's deploying lots of different tools, but it's an amazing amount of shelfware. It's an amazing amount of people buying things that actually don't get used, don't actually produce impact. And I think one of the main reasons for that is people are forgetting the core lesson that you need to bring AI to the user instead of the other way around. So there's lots of tools being deployed that require users to change their behavior instead of working alongside them. And that's obviously a key part of what we're what we do at Grammarly is we bring AI to the user instead of the other way around. And it has a pretty dramatic impact on on productivity. I think it's a space where measuring that can be really hard. And so one of the things I was really excited about is the team came up with this idea. It's a fairly creative idea for how to measure the impact AI is having on a company. So we built a thing we call ROI reports. It's very easy one for any anybody to uh do. Uh we ran it with a number of companies. So a lot of our customers Smart Sheet, Indeed, Data Brick, so on. And the way it works is we basically run an AV test on a company. So we take the Grammarly products and we deploy it to everybody. But for half of them they get real suggestions and for the other half we sort of suppress it and then we measure the impact on productivity based on whatever the company is trying to achieve. And the results were pretty stunning. If you bring AI to the user you get this dramatic impact and its ability to have real impact uh on on on those users and teams. One fun stat, the average um time saved for people in these studies is about 19 days per year. So if you use the Gramly tool set and bring it right to the user, your people will get 19 days a year back in time. So I think this is really important that as we deploy AI, there's lots of hype. We need to deploy it in a way that actually works the way people work and then measure its impact on what it's doing for people. >> Awesome. Um, now in 2025, agents are the biggest buzzword. What does this term mean to you and Grammarly? >> Yeah, so agents I I think everyone here has a different definition of agents. So I'll just share my my way of thinking about it. Um, I like to call agents virtual collaborators. So based on the third era of AI, I think of agents as the the sort of virtual teammates that you can work with. And if you go one click deeper, I think of agents as having uh three things. knowledge, skills and assignments. So knowledge is the set of things they know. So for example, the Grammarly agent knows every rule of the English uh grammar language. Skills are things they can do. So an agent might be able like Grammarly to annotate and edit the the content you're working on. They might be able to take actions on your behalf. It can send an email. It can start an order. Uh can ship something to someone. And then finally is assignments. So I I my view is that you should be able to take agents and hand them assignments. The assignment might be as simple as sit next to me and help me communicate better or as complicated as reach out to every customer and make sure they get a personalized uh personalized outreach to maybe to come to an event or so on. So with that in mind, you can see an incredibly wide set of uh of agents and so maybe I'll give a few examples of ones that I you know in sort of my dreamscape of what I think people are going to see. Um so some agents will differentiate on knowledge. So, for example, uh some of the more popular agents that we're building today are ones that connect with other systems. So, you're going to have agents that connect to Salesforce or Jira or so on. And now when you sit down to write, you're writing your customer memo, you have your your agent that is your English grammar teacher helping make sure you communicate well. But you also have the agent that says, ""I know what this uh what's happening with this customer because I can read Salesforce and I can help you fill in this information."" or when you're trying to promise a feature, you can say, well, I've I've already read what's happening in Jira and I can tell you the correct date that this will come out or the correct positioning from the product marketing team. So, some agents will be about changing that kind of knowledge. Another type might be agents that sort of uplevel into what I what you might think of as coaches. You know, maybe as another example, every sales team has a methodology as you know, some sales teams run with something called medic uh or lots of different methodologies. Imagine every one of those instead of being tutorials and instructions, they became agents that work alongside you and they help your salespeople actually follow the principles of those uh philosophies. That might extend to things like um I I'm really excited about book authors. I think every book author today produces a book that you read and then put in the back of your head. One of my favorite examples is uh I love the book Radical Cander from Kim Scott. And I'm I'm sure for everyone here who's read that, you'll read it and try to follow the guidance. But imagine that Kim didn't just give you a book. Imagine she gave you an agent that sat and watched you work and said, ""You are or aren't following the philosophy of the book."" Maybe one last example, and this one might seem the the craziest, but it was one of the most fun ones. It's having a conversation with the team at Duolingo, and we're just talking about what would it mean for Dolingo to be an agent. Right now, you probably think of Dolingo as an application. Imagine instead that everywhere you worked, your Dualingo agent came with you and it said, uh, you know, you you want to maintain your streak. Instead of going to the app, how about you read three articles today in Spanish? Or maybe while you're reading in English, it can help quiz you a bit on what would this be in Spanish? Or maybe the other way around. While you're reading in Spanish, it can translate the words that you don't know, but let you figure out the ones you should know. And then when you come back to that application, you come back to that agent, it might know what you're trying to go through and say, ""Today's lesson, instead of focusing on how to order food at a restaurant, we're going to focus on how to buy um uh how to buy a house or how to buy a company or whatever it might be."" So that's how I think about agents is, you know, we're going to take knowledge, skills, and assignments, and then it's up to people's dreams of what they can do with those agents. So I think there's lots of things, lots of exciting things coming. >> Yeah. But you know, as a journalist who is using AI tools, one concern I have is that we're entering a world where communication is becoming increasingly automated. How is Grammarly thinking about preserving human authenticity in this environment? >> Yeah. Are we all going to turn into robots or could we still stay still stay humans? I mean, I think this is very core to how Grammarly thinks about AI. I mean, Grammarly at sort of its heart is a user- centric AI company. We we give suggestions to people and those people then take those actions. Right? This is this is help for you to communicate better. And so it's very important that the human is in the loop. It's very important that that each of those suggestions matches the style of the person. It's we want each person to be a better version of themselves, not all be the same way, communicating with the same tone, with the same words, the same insights to be a very boring place uh to to go and live. And I think this idea extends into a lot of our products. And one one one uh one feature launch you mentioned recently was something we did called authorship. Um maybe I'll explain what authorship is um there's a very surprising insight. So uh a large portion of the Gramly audience is is students. It's about a third of the audience and for those uh for those users their challenge with authenticity is sort of sort of existential. And so very simple reason, you know, as students trying to prove to their professor they actually wrote the paper. And so they have this challenge of using AI in ways that are helpful but still staying authentic to to who they are. So we decided to build an agent we call the authorship agent that sort of reverses everything and gives a score as you're writing for how much um how authentic it is to you versus how much AI it is. uh it just watches what you're doing and comes back with a score that then your professor can see that says this paper was written 80% by you and 20% by AI or maybe it's 20% and 80% whatever the goal might be and we're seeing hundreds of schools adopt it and instruct students this is how you can responsibly use AI in a way that allows you to stay authentic but also uh um uh use AI for the for the tools it's uh it's best for so that's a a good example but it's very central to how we Think about it. Our goal is to think of AI or AI agents as collaborators, not replacement for those humans. >> Yeah. Um, and so those that work with you know that you have a focus on rituals. And I hear that you're writing a book called The Rituals of Great Teams as you integrate into your new role. How are you thinking about corporate culture? >> Yeah, it's pretty uh pretty fun topic for me. I I don't know if everybody else feels the same way. I have lots of normal hobbies, but I I found this this this interesting one in collecting rituals. And maybe I'll tell you a little story of where it came from. The um uh I was having a conversation uh with a friend of mine, Bing Gordon. So, Bing, if people don't know him, he was the chief creative officer at Electronic Arts. He's now a famous investor, um Amazon, Zingga, uh you know, hundreds of other companies. and he and I sat on a board together and he was sort of harassing the CEO with this question. He said, ""What are your golden rituals?"" And the CEO was a little flustered and said, ""Uh, I don't Bing, I don't know what you mean."" And so Bing Bing said, ""Oh, well, every great company has a small list of golden rituals and they all meet these three tests."" And he had a very clear list of three tests. So the three tests are um uh the if you think about golden rituals the three tests are uh they are named uh number one number two every employee knows them by their first Friday and number three they're templated the interesting way to think about rituals and he and he proceeded to say if you want to be a great company you need to have your list of golden rituals and he rattled off some of the examples from different companies Amazon does six pages Google does OKRs Salesforce does V2 Um, and we had this whole discussion about the rituals of those uh of those companies. Um, I got really excited about this idea. I started talking about it whenever I whenever I could. Started talking about with friends at other companies. And over the course of the last three or four years, I've turned it into my side project writing this book called Rituals of Great Teams. Easy to find rituals of great teams.com. the um I've interviewed about a thousand or so uh founders, entrepreneurs, you know, authors, so on to just collect up rituals from all the best companies in the world and try to categorize them into uh into a set that people can actually use. Maybe one one um one fun story from those interviews. I was talking to uh Dermesh. Der is the uh founder of HubSpot and the ritual he contributed to the book is called flashtags. It's a way to communicate to indicate severity of of your opinions on topics. But his actual uh more interesting insight was he said Shashir the reason he's so excited about the reason I'm so excited about rituals he said the uh I think that as companies we misunderstand what we're building as companies we're actually building two products one product for our customers that's what they all use in his case it's HubSpot and we're building a whole other product for the company itself it's the product that builds the product and he said the thing when people ask about that second product they'll often describe it as culture but if you ask people to describe culture, they will they will culture manifests as rituals. And so he said by paying attention to rituals, what you're actually doing is putting the same amount of thought into the product for your customers as you are the product for for your teams. So anyways, it's it's been a very interesting journey to get to learn about rituals and of course I'm in this unique position now of combining two companies, Grammarly and KOD, and we're going through this really interesting process of taking all the rituals from both companies and selectively applying them. sometimes taking the Gramly ritual, sometimes taking the cod ritual, sometimes coming up with a brand new ritual. And we've done a number of them. Everything from how you take make decisions, how you do planning, how you hire people. And I think that idea of build the product that that builds the product is a really powerful way to think about what we do in our companies. >> Amazing. And uh looking ahead, I'm wondering what untapped opportunities in workplace productivity is Grammarly poised to address. You know, I I think this idea of supercharging humans with agents. I I think it's a really provocative way to think about what what we're going through. I think a lot of a lot of people look at AI as a threat. I think I look at AI the opposite way. We're about to give every person 10,000 interns and they're great. They're s they're you know, if you think about uh these folks, they never disagree with each other. you know don't you know they'll follow your instructions but it's also this amazing challenge right now you know you take the average person who's maybe never been a manager before they say now you have 10,000 people to manage and I think that idea of rethinking what how we think about AI and productivity it's not really about replacing anybody about turning us all into scaled managers and I think that that frame is it's it's much more exciting but it's also gives you this challenge how are you going to take these people how are you going to train them, how you going to give them better instructions, how you going to audit what they're doing and making sure it works well. But I think that's the exciting mission that we're working on now. >> Amazing. Thank you. >> Yeah, I think we're right at time.",unknown
i6l1Ai_gc68,"I've been using Grammarly for many years now, but if you had told me back then what Grammarly could do now, that'd be pretty mind-blowing. It's a tool that makes our lives easier, and it just continually iterates and improves. Making sure that you stay ahead of the curve is truly important, and this is the way to do it is with a tool like Grammarly. I'm a manager of design operations at Procore Technologies. One of the critical pieces of my role is change management. People can resist change and so how do you approach that? And this is where Grammarly has been really helpful. Having an AI teammate like Grammarly is really beneficial with making sure that we're getting the information across succinctly, making sure that the tone of voice is what we want and what will be best received by the individuals who will be reading the messaging. Thing that I really love the most about Grammarly is how it's literally my writing assistant. It follows me around everywhere I go and it has really helped me be more efficient in the work that I do. And that to me is the most important part is being able to make sure that I'm staying focused on what I'm doing and I don't have to, you know, start looking elsewhere to figure out things. It really just helps me be a better communicator, which is really like a big portion of my job. That to me is the way AI works.

I didn't want to come across too harsh or too soft, and Grammarly helped me tweak the tone of my email just right. One new Grammarly feature that I find most useful is the paragraph rewrite. Trust me, this is everything. Sometimes I'll write the paragraph and I can see that it's clunky, but I just couldn't see how to fix it. Grammarly's AI assistant steps in, tidies it up, and boom, it's clean, it's professional, but most importantly, it sounds just like me. Just last week, I had 10 minutes in between my client calls and needed to send a document to an executive team. What I did was to draft my ideas and ask Grammarly AI to make them informative and more detailed. This was like magic. In a matter of seconds, I had a wow document.

Now, things were not looking good in the first couple of hours because despite literally messaging dozens of places, I wasn't getting any responses. But then it hit me. It was probably because my messages were pretty unprofessional, looking like this. In my quest for quantity, I ended up sacrificing quality.

where all of you are joining us from welcome from all over the world my name is Jenny Maxwell and I am the general manager for the Education team here at gramarly and I'm really excited to be uh having a conversation today with Dr C Edward Watson who I get to affectionately call Eddie um Eddie would you like to come off and introduce yourself to our audience hello everyone I'm Eddie Watson I am the vice president for digital Innovation at the American Association of colleges and universities also known as AAC andu welcome we're so excited today we're going to evaluate the First full Academic Year together with generative AI discuss the biggest lessons that we've learned and then shift Focus to the Future and discuss how to develop a plan for the upcoming school year we're going to begin in just a few minutes before we do just a few uh items of housekeeping because of the size of this webinar we um automatically mute everybody but um you're able to ask questions if you just uh engage in the uh Q&A uh widget at the bottom of your screen we're we're happy to um to take questions we've also had hundreds of questions submitted prior to this event today so we're going to try to spend time at the end to make sure we address some of the more common questions to enable close cap to enable close captioning click the CC button at the bottom of your webinar um pictured here and then we're going to be using slido for audience participation throughout the webinar uh to join you're going to enter um the Q you're going to scan the QR code on the screen um or click the link in the chat um because we want this to be interactive we want want to hear uh your thoughts uh throughout so lastly don't worry about taking any notes today we will be sending out a recorded copy of uh of the event so you won't miss a thing so with that um I I want to start off with just a retro um looking back in the last 9 to 12 months um we we've seen a lot of headlines uh around generative AI gen AI seemed to affect every aspect of higher education for students and staff and faculty and before we dive into our discussion let's let's look back at some of the the top headlines um that Educators and administr administrators had to make sense of this year so academic Integrity almost as soon as gen entered campuses institutions had to develop policies not to just use it for education but manage it detect it and have a perspective on what appropriate use was we saw assessment and Grading come up the effectiveness of geni heightened all of our concerns when it started completing traditional assignments as well or even better than what we would expect of our students uh privacy and security came up and while the future of learning of the learning experience has taken Center Stage institutions have been required to navigate privacy and security concerns just like every other business adopting new technology and then the future of work one of the biggest things that the education Community has been grappling with is how to best prepare students for this AI connected Workforce while preserving the fundamental building blocks of learning and then admission processes were affected this was the first year that colleges had to develop a philosophy on what to do about AI generated and AI assisted admission essays these handful of news stories is a lot and it only represents just a snapshot of the complexity of higher ed that professionals here are having to navigate and to underscore just how fast things are moving in the space just yesterday open AI made a major announcement that they have a new GPT model that leverages more multimodal voice and image functionality that delivers stepwise Improvement on individual tutoring and assistive support the bottom line is that the tech will always continue to outpace our Collective ability to adjust and adopt so it's imperative that the education sector stays a breast of the AI landscap cape and understands how to adjust in the best interest of both faculty and students today we're not going to just answer all the questions but with expert insights of Dr Watson the session is intended to offer a few answers and more importantly better frame these questions so Educators can approach them headon this coming year all right I gave a brief and incomplete snapshot of some of the major themes around AI this past year with the extensive research you've done for your new book shown here and uh you have one of the most informed perspectives on this topic Eddie would what would you see as the major theme across education from this past year in relation to generative AI technology well excellent question and first off Jen thanks to you and Cliff and your colleagues for inviting me to be a part of of this webinar I'm really excited to have this conversation with you I think this is maybe our third or fourth conversation and each of the earlier ones could have been the webinar so I'm hoping that this one has similar quality and is uh equally um interesting so most important themes um well I think that I think that the first semester so spring 2023 we were just learning that this existed and that students were using it um it was mostly sort of like a reaction that then led into the fall of like okay so what what do we do to kind of keep it at bay how do we keep AI out of the classroom we already have courses that you know work pretty well to achieve certain learning outcomes for our students so there's been it was initially sort of like how do we protect what we are currently doing um a number of different strategies kind of emerged there one was around AI detection you know if we had a technology that could war with students technology that maybe we don't change anything in our classes that was sort of like One initial Instinct um but you know how do we sort of protect what we've we've got in our own classes and I think for me it's kind of been the metaphor of like you know us fighting with the kids in the back seat in the car and we're sort of like waving at the kids while we're trying to keep doing what we've been doing as they've got this new thing that they're working with but at the same time as we're sort of doing that in our own car driving down the interstate another car passed us and that was the world of work where employers are rapidly adopting across all business sectors generative AI in fact a survey from late last year so late 2023 from Amazon World Service interviewed have surveyed employers from all business sectors not just it and they found that nearly all of them 93% said that they've either already adopted generative AI or they see across a timeline Horizon that they will be adopting generative AI so I'm going to create a little bit of a false binary here regarding sort of these core themes but you know one instinct is we want to continue to ensure that our students achieve the learning outcomes that they need within our courses so how do we sort of to keep AI at Bay but now another car has passed us on the interstate that we have to pay attention to and this other car is requiring that we actually Infuse our curriculum with AI skills AI learning outcomes AI literacies so again a bit of a false binary but how do we preserve and ensure students continue to achieve the learning outcomes that we have for our courses while also ensuring that they have this new skill set that is rapidly required ired in the world of work well and I I love the metaphor so much um we have a unique perspective at grammarly because we work with over 3,000 Global institutions in higher ed but we also work with over 70,000 teams in in in the fortune 1000 and so we're we're able to see kind of what's happening in real time on the education side and then know explicitly what our business partners are saying they are demanding of their employees and their um you know people who who want to go work at their companies and so we feel like if if I can extend on this metaphor gramarly somebody that the both cars are asking for direction uh and uh one of those cars is I would say is not even a car anymore I feel like the world of work is Now quickly approaching like a bullet train if you will and how quickly they're adapting and and what their expectations are for um for their employees so um love that you know we we spent a lot of time thinking about um resistant to change I think part of that is just human behavior like denial acceptance grief all those stages we went through I'd love some perspective for you because you know it's no surprise and secret that grammarly was brought into the the plagiarism and AI detection conversation um at the sort of expense of a student and and there are many more students like her so I'd love your perspective on this a AI plagiarism detection sort of knee-jerk reaction that we saw in the last Academic Year what do you what do you think about it well I guess I have two points of recommendation for for campuses that are considering AI detection one is short and one is long so the short one is I recommend that you don't use it um and so the long answer has a lot of components associated with it one is around the notion of all of these tools have some rate of false positive in other words a student did not use AI to generate student work they turn it in and then it gets FAL flagged and then a faculty member is then you know it's a black box you don't really know what it's scoring against or how it's scoring so you're told by the technology this student indeed cheated using AI so then you take steps forward with that student who was falsely accused um so that's that's a real problematic scenario um there's also the notion of false negatives so in other words so let's say I did cheat using AI but then the tool doesn't catch it it lets me through so you might question well who gets through the net then is it the student who is paying for access to the latest tool so you know someone that's paying $20 a month to have access to Claude 3 Opus or is it the student that's using a free tool and so if you think well who's most likely to um subscribe or pay $20 a month for an AI is it your pel eligible students or your more affluent students so more than likely the students that are going to get away or that are going to be um not flagged whenever they should have been flagged those false negatives are the affluent students want do we really want to have a tool that has some inequities built within it that are against those that are already less commonly served by our educational institutions probably not but I think also if we take a step back and we look well what is the scope of the problem I mean as I go from campus to campus and have conversations I had a about a month ago a first year first year writing instructor who's also it was her first year teaching so you know she came to me and she Saidi think all of my students are cheating I think every last one of them are using Ai and I said why do you think that and she said well the papers all sound the same and I said well you you are teaching a bunch of 17y olds so it's possible that they sound a lot alike because most of your students are at similar stage in in writing but you know she you know her intuition isn't entirely wrong but research shows that professors we get it right about 54% of the time we're able to recognize AI produced writing about the flip of a coin so we're not really good at this so when asked do AI detectors work well AI detectors are probably better than us but they do have this whole notion of false positives and false negatives that really should call into question whether or not we want to further exacerbate student mental health um challenges on our campuses um where in fact there's strategies available for us so just you know one thought down this line is well how how pervasive is this problem and there is a bit of a moral Panic you know this faculty member this instructor from a month ago that said I think all of my students are cheating and certainly some of the AI detection tools out there are trying to sort of accelerate and expand that view but it was interesting a a press release last month from turnitin.com heralded their oneyear anniversary of um of AI detection and they said that they had reviewed over 200 million pieces of student writing and within that giant sample of student writing 22 million had been flagged for using AI to write 20% or more of the paper so wait 22 million out of 200 million that's like 10 or 11% so in a class of 30 we're talking about three students that actually turn in student turn in work produced by AI so this isn't this isn't all of your students are cheating or even half of your class is cheating it's a much smaller percentage and so there's a lot of ped pedagogical approaches structural approaches that we could take within our courses that could help students make the right decision that's really uh one of the core F folky within the book is how can we sort of move nudge you know from three students to maybe two students make poor decisions maybe then just one student make a poor decision again in a class of 30 as my as my example but yeah given the scope of challenge around AI detection and the student Mental Health crisis and also just the ongoing decline of Americans perception of confidence in higher education um I don't think that we're doing right by our students or by our institutions by using AI detection as a solution to this particular challenge especially given that it is a 10 or 11% uh challenge not a all my students cheating kind of challenge yeah I appreciate that perspective um and we could you and I could just Riff on the look back for the entire time but in the interest of offering Future Ready Solutions um we're going to Pivot a little bit before we do um know I want to transition to the forward-looking conversation but I also want a temperature check with the audience so I want to know how everyone is currently feeling about tackling this upcoming year with geni now granted this is the the the sort of before the conversation uh temperature check um but go ahead and join us on uh through slido and in just one word pick your pick your word one word I have to tell everybody just one um how you're describing about the upcoming school year um and then if everything works out as you type your words in it'll uh it'll we should see these words uh populate into a word cloud here on Zoom which great it's working okay love this um I don't know about you Eddie but I am like an eternal optimist I believe that humans are inherently good and I think that most of the conversations at least from um from where I said at grammarly most of the administrators and the faculty we've moved out of the fear side of generative Ai and we are we have really quickly pivoted more on the fascination about how AI can really um Force education to become more creative for these assessments to reflect a higher level thinking than just writing as an assessment of learning um so I I love seeing this come up so to our audience um thank you for coming into the conversation open-minded that's what some of these um these words kind of bring out to me I don't know Eddie if you have any commentary on on this and what you're seeing uh on a larger scale as you have conversations but well I really like seeing that excited is the main work word I think that there are a lot of reasons to be hopeful and optimistic about what AI might bring to um higher education and you know whenever I cited that statistic of you know 10 or 11% of students turning in work produced by AI it's certainly a far higher percentage of students that are using AI in really creative ways um like as an example like if a student gets your assignment and get your rubric for how you're going to grade that assignment and they upload it into an AI and and ask hey this is going to be a five-page paper can you provide me with an outline of this paper and then I'll write it all myself but provide me with an outline I guess one question is is that cheating or you know asking for feedback after you wrote it and then maybe make revisions again it's all your own writing is that examples of cheating but when you think about it they're they they're both helpful they'll both result in a better product the students doing the work and it actually mirrors what's likely to take place in the real world I think that sometimes what we call cheating in higher ed business calls progress I think uh you know recognizing students are using it broadly but maybe not cheating in the traditional definition of like hey it did the paper for me and then I turn it in there's lots of creative ways that it's being used I think that most students are excited about it and I think that we should be too yeah I love that perspective U and and giving the autonomy back to the individual faculty member to decide what what they're willing to bear and maybe that's going to vary per assignment or it's going to vary at a certain point throughout the course or the The Learning Journey of each individual student there's just a lot that we get to I I love that I get to Bear witness to what I will believe to be a true sort of Renaissance of teaching because of the tool like I've been in the space for a long time and it's just exciting for me to watch who is going to step forward and do things dramatically differently and and what the outcomes are going to be so broadening things let's let's think about the imperatives for faculty hire at institutions as a whole to incorporate AI more thoughtfully across the curriculum your book specifically devotes a considerable portion to the changing nature of work as a result of generative AI what are the biggest changes happening in the workforce as a result of AI that you see well I think maybe the biggest challenge or not necessarily challenge but the biggest change that I'm seeing is that it's broadly adopted across so many different business sectors you know not just within the IT world and it's being used not just for language production but also code production you know computer code for instance but just every sector is finding creative interesting new ways to use it in fact my family care um physician who has always been a very much sort of heads down he he rolls in with the laptop on a little cart he's always head down typing away and uh while he's talking to me he's great I love our family physician but he's now piloting a new system where he rolls in with the same cart but actually he turns and talks to me and it's listening and his role isn't to be typing in Insurance codes and taking notes the whole time it's providing a draft for him that then he reviews at the end so ultimately you know he reviews he makes sure it's all accurate he makes changes all of that kind of stuff so I guess what I'm suggesting is is that we're seeing a change in the way that work is looking the way those tasks look and it's actually changing the way that we think um like the way that you can see like in this example I just gave you see the patient not the technology and the patient sees the doctor not the technology it becomes something that's more in the background still assisting and aiding but um you know as I think about the whole that shift it hearkens me back to being nine years old and seeing Dr Hall whenever you know I was a kid and actually the whole entire interaction was all face to face and over time that's been eroded so I'm really hopeful that a lot of these shifts will take on tedious tasks um across a range of different career sectors take care of the tedious task and then we can actually do the things that humans do best and the things that we enjoy more so I I feel hopeful that it's actually going to result in maybe many of us being happier in our work lives as a result of the kinds of things that it can do for us I love the irony of that uh story right where the technology adopt adoption actually helps us go back to our lives and and sort of Engagement with one another before technology right like think about what the doctor's offices look like of yester year and um imagining like let's take that metaphor and actually or not metaphor but that example and say think about what what a student could go through like those office hours conversations those those those engagements that faculty have to have they teach hundreds of students and they're not able to um prior to this technology maybe have the level of engagement on a first student basis that now we might be able to unlock I mean do you foresee this transferring into the direct faculty student relationship I do think that there are those possibilities I think that there is I think for all faculty we can look at our work from one week to the next and there are things that we really enjoy doing and then there are things that maybe we we don't enjoy doing so much like we're at the you know the end of the semester on on many campuses and I bet a a lot of people participating in this webinar writing lots of letters of recommendation right now and probably um one approach that you have for that is you have a letter that you wrote in the past and so whenever you have to write a new letter for a student you take that old template and then you revise it and you know then you have like you know the three paragraphs in the Middle where you're really writing about the student student you know getting a draft of a letter um you know typically whenever I would have a have a student ask me for a letter I would say can you send me like three or three or four bullets that you would like for me to emphasize and then of course I decide whether or not I I agree that those are things I want to emphasize know you were not the greatest student I had in all time but thank you for that thought so anyways you've got those bulleted lists now you can go to Ai and say hey here's a letter I've written in the past change the name to this student name and highlight emphasize these strengths and so then you get a draft and then you can edit the draft of course I mean while AI might produce this letter um I'm responsible for the final product I'm I'm the lead author so I take full responsibility for whatever I do then send forward but to be able to cut time off of the writing process and then I review and revise and maybe add in a little anecdote you know instead of maybe the process of writing the letter taking 20 to 30 minutes you know maybe cut 50% of that time off which means that you then have well capacity to recharge yourself or capacity to engage more in course planning or or what what does it enable whenever you no longer have to do as many of the tedious tasks um and then you can then lean into the things that maybe you really enjoy whether you're at you know an R1 and you want to you need to focus more on Research or whether you're um you you have a a large teaching load as an instructor if you didn't have to do some those tedious pieces now you can lean into um the parts of your work that you enjoy the most and I think that there's no shortage of Faculty who really want to start enjoying more of their work life um so I don't need any we don't need a word cloud to say yes or no if you agree I I know that that is definitively true um and not just faculty but everyone right now being able to do more of what we love so that we we as human beings can can overall uh feel more uh motivated and excited about our purpose so love all of that I I want to kind of go back to students so knowing that the world of work is this bullet train um and certainly from from our perspective I think we worked with um Forester and when we did this poll back in 2023 it was 97% of uh companies that that were pulled will have a definitive AI strategy by 2025 which is you know in about seven months um what do you what do you think that these Workforce changes um what kind of implication do they have for students graduating in the next one to five seven years yeah that's a real interesting time frame I mean I think that you you know higher education K12 education all educational institutions we have a variety of purposes but without a doubt one of our purposes is to prepare students for life after they leave the institution and part of that life will indeed be the world of of work so you know I think right now it's higher ed is figuring out H how to position themselves with policies and strategies around academic integrity and I think those are important important things for us to be working toward I think we're you know it's a we're on a train that's on multiple rails right now and like yes we need to be doing policy and academic Integrity work but we also need to recognize that you know we had students that just graduated do we feel that they're ready for this world that has quickly emerged how might we position ourselves so that our Rising seniors those that graduate a year from today essentially how can we position our work and position our curricula and the practices within our courses to prepare those graduates for jobs that are going to exist within a year that's a that's a real heavy lift you know given where we currently are as an industry to make those kinds of rapid changes especially given that we're talking about a sliver of the curriculum you know we're talking about the senior year the 4,000 level courses and is that the appropriate place to have this place maybe it should be in all Capstone courses but these are the kinds of questions that we need to think through to prepare those students I think um I would I wish the challenge was how do we prepare our incoming freshmen for the world that awaits them when they graduate in four to six years you know how do we you know that would give us time to do the curricular revision really thoughtfully and and really well but I don't think that we can divorce ourselves from the students that we currently have on our campus so I think it's um I think that in the same way that the pandemic created a an a mission imperative opportunity for Sinners of teaching and learning in higher education I think we have a again found ourselves in a similar moment that I would argue is even more imperative that now it's not just about you know moving a course into an online setting we're actually drilling back into our curricula to figure out where where should we be teaching these skills often within the discipline you know certainly having some generic AI skills is helpful but if I'm going to if I'm a nursing student and I'm going to be in the nursing field I I really want to be taught how is AI being used in the field right now what am I likely to experience whenever I get a job or what skills do I need to indeed get that job what are what are employers now looking for well then how do we position those students with the students we currently have how do we engender those skills along with everything else that we need to still teach them um this isn't this isn't an easy um solution but it's the challenge that we have ahead of us and I I don't think we cannot lean into this this coming fall semester I think this is something that we need to figure out in each department and program in college and university in higher education we need to have a strategy for how to give students the skills that they rapidly will need just one year from now or even less um this is this is truly from my perspective a call of leadership and everyone who's joined the webinar um whether you consider yourself a leader or not you are by nature of of even engaging with us in this conversation today I'd love I know and Eddie do a great job um deeply detailing ways to start um iterating curriculum like taking bite-size uh chunks of this and doing things that are um you can action on that aren't so overwhelming do you want to give a little sneak peak about some of those recommendations you have around how to start adjusting curriculum ahead of fall yeah I think that the the first thing um unfortunately after I think all Educators at the moment have an unfunded mandate to explore and play with AI tools and this kind of is now part of the job because this world is moving so quickly you know as you uh noted at the top there's now um a new version of chat GPT for Omni when I first saw it I thought it was ominous um I don't know if that's the best branding if that's where my eye went first but it's uh so anyway anyways that's changing things and that's supposed to be you know available to everyone and then there's you know the world of AI isn't monolithic you know there's multiple large language models so there are tools that have different brains if you will so like Claude has a different brain and Google's Gemini has a different brain a different Model A different approach and so they have different strengths and different weaknesses so knowing when to use which tool in the toolbox is part of what we as faculty need to understand and we also need to engender that in our students but of course these large language models that we you know we talk about there's many many many tools that are now using sort of like Pathways things that are called open apis like uh chat GPT has a path where you can create your own very focused tool that does a specific task or set of tasks that's using the larger um brain from open AI so there's lots of disciplinary Focus tools that are using like the chat GPT brain um that we need to know about within our discipline so I think my my summer recommendations are play with the tools pay a fee to at least for one month to have access to the best tool um or tools and then enter your assignments and see what kind of output it gives you um there's a big difference between the free tools and the paid tools um so that's one thing that you should do I I would also recommend that if you have an Advisory board for your department or your college um that's probably comprised of employers or past graduates of your institution reach out to those folks and say so how has the world changed for you in the last year what what skills are you asking um are you now riding into job descriptions what what do you expect our graduates to be able to do I mean what are what are you looking for essentially and how has your work changed because without understanding that Focus Target you don't know what you're revising your curriculum toward so that that's uh I think essential work this summer and then once you sort of now know what the learning outcomes need to be then it becomes an an exercise of curriculum redesign which we all love curriculum redesign so as a former CTL director I'm not joking I really do but most people probably don't have the same interest or passion in that in that notion but so okay you know that students need to know how to do X Y and Z with these new tools within your discipliner field okay so where in your curriculum are you going to teach that okay so it's in these three courses well those three faculty who teach those three courses do they have the knowledge skills and abilities to be able to work with the AI That's being used in industry that just came about so there a whole professional development um mechanism that needs to kind of come into play um as we situ um specific outcomes within the curriculum and then within individual courses but then how do you actually teach how to use those tools um in meaningful ways that again complements the other set of learning outcomes that you have um in front of you in fact this this larger challenge I guess I see this as maybe the the higher education pedagogical Zeitgeist uh challenge for us and at at the where I work at the American Association of colleges and universities we are launching an Institute on AI pedagogy and the curriculum to help um departments and programs or even colleges or the entire University rethink um this exact question then help you make that transition so you would send a team from your program or from your University that would then focus on these um issues with us and we have a group of national experts but um at the a acu.org website there's a little icon for it you can't miss it um for the institute on AI pedagogy and um the curriculum though the deadline is six days from now so I encourage you if if this sounds at all of of interesting to have some help with the work I just described uh we're certainly um positioning ourselves to be the leaders in helping higher ed make that transition that's wonderful and I'll I'll see if someone from our team can also put the the link to that um uh in our chat for for those that are well how about that yeah there you go it'll magically appear thank you um technology well um we have to honor uh some time on on the Q&A because we we had so many questions submitted ahead of today's event and I want to make sure we get to as many as possible but before we hop on to take questions I want to highlight some of the work that grammarly has been doing to support Educators through this transition in the new era of gen um first just reminder we've been in the game for 15 years uh we've been focusing on topics discussed today from a thought leadership perspective but also we're deeply committed to product Innovation that really supports this work so today both students and professionals use grammarly to write more clearly confidently and effectively our robust controls allow institutions to set the parameters on how students use generative AI so you you do have um granular control whether there's certain departments or schools that want the generative AI functionality turned on um you have that ability with grammar which is something we're really proud to be able to bring to this um to this Market the other thing too is that uh grammarly is contextually aware so we're able to help students write in both academic settings emails we can U know where you're writing and offer up suggestions that are relevant to producing great content for that specific workflow so if you you're going to see a poll if you want to learn more about how grammarly is going uh is moving forward to support both students and institutions and faculty uh with responsible deployment of generative AI tools click yes and someone from the team will get in touch with you um and thank you so much for that but so I'm going to be bringing on my uh assistant here Cliff not really my assistant but in this space I can call him that and he's going to be able to uh raise some of the questions um from the that were submitted earlier and that have been submitted throughout today's event so far so Cliff please welcome hi Jenny hi Eddie um help everyone so I want to start with two questions that came in during the live chat and I'm going to go in reverse order uh so just building on some of the points you were making Eddie around skill development um and trying to be more aligned with the workforce Charles asks how do you see the development of Baseline skills in this gen context do students need to develop General writing coding EX skills before leaning into AI is it a joint effort um I think this is getting at some of the pedagogical questions around what Baseline skills do you need before you actually leverage generative tools effectively and how do you develop those in a world where the technolog is moving so quickly yeah so I think that generative AI is like the best thing that could happen to us as individuals highered or uh teaching professionals because we already have all of the expertise and so when there is a product that uh is produced by AI we already have all of the knowledge that we need the prerequisite skills to be able to further revise to engage in that human AI hybrid writing process to provide you know a final product that's of exceptional quality we H we have the skills that make us good collaborators with AI maybe our gened students who are new to a specific topic area domain they don't have the requisite skills that will enable them then to be great fault partners with AI in producing work so yes we we need to continue to um engender those foundational skills so I think part of the challenge for us then is how do we continue to do that whenever students I'll have access to AI at this moment and I think part of it is I guess one recommendation is is that for every assignment that's given in America I would say there needs to be an AI policy not just on your syllabus on each individual assignment and it should not only say when you can use AI it should also say why so like I know that AI does this really really well but however you probably don't yet and therefore for this assignment um you're not allowed to use AI because I want you to develop these skills and then later on this semester or later in the curriculum next semester that's whenever you're going to be able to lean into a partnership with AI because then you'll have the prerequisite skills without the foundational knowledge you're you're not a very good thought partner with AI quite yet so there's lots of foundational skills that we're going to have to continue to teach I think that for instance writing it's hard to be a good editor if you're if you don't have you know strong writing skills I think that there's probably shifts that we're going to see in the way that we we um the way that we teach writing and that part of what we should be teaching now is actually editorial skills so certainly continue about writing but there should also be opportunities probably in our freshman English courses to have students act as editor given that in the real world that's what uh writing's going to likely look like outside of maybe creative settings or our scholarship or things like that but yes I guess guess the short answer and I rarely have short answers but the short answer is yes we do need to continue to ensure students achieve those foundational learning outcomes that we previously had aspired for them um but we also need to be engendering how to leverage those skills within the context or or you know using Ai and that that's a generalized statement I mean you know as we as you go from one discipline to the next and then maybe one specific learning outcome within a discipline to the next there's certainly going to be scenarios where well maybe maybe that's something that we don't need um to to teach any longer like I was a um I was a double major in statistics and English and I was the last generation of student that had row and wait no columns and columns and row row and rows and rows of numbers that I had to add by hand um when I was a senior a mini tab came on uh the scene and then it's like oh wait everything I've been doing for three years now the computer does and I have never you know I still do Ed research and I've have added a row of um you know rows or a column of numbers um since 1994 or whatever it was so there are some skills that maybe we we won't have to do um anymore some tasks we may not have to do anymore so I think that each of us within our own curricula will make those decisions we'll see how the real world is changing we'll see what AI can do expertly that maybe we can make some decisions well we're going to decrease the amount of instruction around this outcome within our curriculum and then actually fill in those gaps within the schedule with uh additional new outcomes that are associated with AI or how the discipline itself is changing I mean you know curriculum does evolve and this is just one of the current forces that is is um bringing us to a moment of rethinking what we're teaching within our courses and why yeah um just as a plug from from previous webinars and content um Charles and others who are curious if you check out our grammarly um for Education events page which we can link to in the chat we have a white paper from March just on the future of writing and that collaborative writing process that Eddie touched on between Ai and know student um amongst other content that you can find there so feel free to check that out um one of the other questions that came in during your discussion about academic Integrity as part of look back um was challenging you a little bit in in a I think a helpful way Eddie but um and Jenny want your take on this too the question is how do we acknowledge the scope of the academic Integrity problem without falling into moral panic I definitely worry about overselling the scope of the problem to your point Eddie but I worry about underselling it too well I think that there's a we're we're tuning aren't we we're sort of we we we need data that provides us with evidence so that we can make a solid decisions that are actually addressing the problem so I think that there's there's macro level data like the statistics that were nested within that press release from turn it in you know that that's a very large sample 200 million and 22 million were flagged with 20% or more um AI so that gives us a sense globally but you know what's what's happening happening in your your particular classroom I think there's an opportunity to provide um to collect data from your own students to ask questions to have conversations with them and without a doubt students are going to lean toward you know oh mistrusting you so you're asking me if I'm cheating of course the answer is no so there you know I think there's opportunities to have you know a focus group on your campus um uh surveys that are um Anonymous and knowing that students are going to under report but you can still still grab a snapshot I mean a good example of this is we've seen surveys where students admit to using AI for academic purposes have varied from 22% of students say that they are all the way to 89% of students say that they are um it's probably more toward the upper end of that you know but students again you know uh are making probably wise decisions depending on the context within which they are but I think we you need to know more about the student lived experience with AI and so maybe it's not a focus group where we say all right I want to begin by asking how many of you are cheating with AI but rather hey so how is AI helping you um with your college life you know like how how are you using this maybe as a productivity tool and then kind of ease into conversations you know maybe it's not you maybe how do you know your friends are using it so don't share how you're using but don't give any names don't give any classes but how you know how are your how are your friends using it I think there's um I can give you a snapshot to better understand what the livt culture with AI is among students within your courses or on your institution or within your department or program so I think having a better sense um you know I used to say that 10 uh National surveys it's they're worth about they're equal to one survey in your local population you know so having data from your own context and then that can help you make uh clearer decisions regarding ing what strategies you might you might employ I mean there was a there was a conversation in the fall around AI resistant assignments so like let's design assignments so that students can't use Ai and we took some of those examples as we were finishing up the book and we had student focus groups and we shared this notion of air resistant assignments and we shared them with students and they were like oh I know how I could do this with AI and I was like could you show me and then like 90 seconds later they had two drafts of things and they asked for a poor version and then a better version and then they talked about you know how are these different you know basically had AI do every step of the process to way that something was very interestingly significantly problematized so I think ultimately we all know that cheating has existed forever and that there are a small percentage of students that are always going to cheat you know given the opportunity but if you think about why do students cheat it's well they have the opportunity but but they also are under some sort of duress like they don't have enough time or they don't know how to do the work so I think if we can kind of normalize getting help or assistance have easy paths for getting help that helps with a piece of that but let's say that you have five writing assignments due in your class what if instead of all five being due at midnight on Sunday what if students could select three where they could get a two-day extension no questions asked so five assignments you can take three of them and get that extension well students that choose will to do that will probably have very busy lives there's reasons why they would choose to do that um they would be then hey I'll take the extra two days that means I'm less likely to cheat and then I'm actually more likely to do the work which is when the learning takes place I mean indeed every assessment we give our students whether it's writing a paper or taking a multiple choice test every assessment is an act of pedagogy so so if we give students a couple of extra days so that they do the work then they're going to actually learn the material um so there's multiple benefits to having some flexibility such as allowing students to have a couple of extra days um or to just make it clear how students can receive help and probably also uh Sunday night deadlines aren't a great one because you know students are going to work on things on the weekend when literally every service on campus is most likely closed so there's just multiple things structurally just little nudges that we can do that those three students that may have cheated well maybe now that they could ask for the extension maybe none of them would choose to use AI to actually do the work and now they're actually going to spend the next 48 hours struggling to complete the task as best they can there's nuances like that um that we certainly should adopt I I think that lends nicely to another question that Scarlet posed before the webinar um is around Bloom's taxonomy um she asks is there any level yet that AI cannot replicate effectively allowing a student to avoid actual learning if so how can Educators leverage assignments that will evoke those upper levels of blooms while still helping students to understand the basics yeah so I don't know that I would say that that there any level of blooms for those of you that aren't familiar it's like a pyramid and it's like lower level um learning outcomes are are kind of easier to to teach to like memorization or just simple understanding where at the top of the pyramid like the higher order learning outcomes that you really need in the real world and you need in the world of work are things like being able to analyze or to evaluate you know make quality judgments of things or to create your own content that's at the very the very top so I mean depending on the discipline and the task AI has varying abilities Associated and it does I think that as experts look at the quality of content produced for higher order learning outcome comes sometimes it hits the mark and sometimes it it doesn't but without a doubt as you push higher on Bloom's taxonomy from a a learning outcomes perspective and if you Aspire for those and provide some flexibility within the assignment where students actually see themselves in it so okay I want you to uh analyze a current business strategy um for a nonprofit that you care about know if it's something that students care about like you know I really um SPCA or something like that and you want to dive into that well students less likely to cheat if it's something that they care about so I mean there are things that you can do that can further encourage students to um want to engage in the work but then also you're pushing them on higher order learning outcomes which helps to build durable transferable skills I mean for a long time prior to um AI one of the complaints about uh new graduates is that they have difficulty transferring The Fairly organized information that we provided them whenever they were in college transferring that to Ill structured real world problems so having opportunities for students to do things that mirror the real world like experiential learning like undergraduate research or doing Service Learning or projects within the community um it's more of a challenge to have ai do all of it without a doubt there's pieces that humans have to you know you can't send your laptop you know over to the SPCA for you um so there's just a lot of ways to kind of make things more complex make things more interesting for students push them toward higher order learning outcomes but and I I I always sto short I I wasn't stopping short about the notion of AI resistance as Jose and I were writing the book we were both kind of there until we put some of those assignments in front of students and then had more complicated conversations with them but it's clear that the student who is motivated to cheat and is a power user of AI can can do a lot of tasks so it behooves us to without a doubt especially at the jior and senior level to be pushing higher on Bloom's taxonomy but also provide real world opportunities to do the work and to let students have some agency about what that assignment or project might look like just it's a it makes it more difficult to use AI plus students will want to do the work because they're doing things that they themselves have selected to do that they care about I I as Jenny mentioned we got a ton of great questions so thank you to the audience we have time for one more before the top of the hour um like your perspective on on this question both of your perspectives I'll start with Jenny but um minoski asks and I hope I pronounced that correctly I just thought this was a provocative way to end how can we use AI in a way that allows us to remain true to our own voice instead of everyone starting to speak the same AI ins sipid language um I love that uh I love that when I'm on grammarly so this is my response that grammarly uh has learned a lot about who I am how I like to say things um the suggestions that they give me are contextually relevant to the work that I'm doing whether it's a professional draft to my boss um or it's an email to some of my college friends it's recommending um Efficiencies For Me based on the outcome of the content and so I would encourage um everyone who hasn't seen if you haven't seen grammarly in the last six months you haven't seen grammarly um and the other thing too is it as it relates to our own voice part of that voice is the willingness to keep um gen functionality uh you know protected to some degree if you really need students to develop their voice before understanding what uh is a good recommendation from the AI we have that flexibility too as well I know he mentioned it before but a lot of a lot of my experience within grammarly is thinking about my thinking and allows me to really understand the reflection that I do as a writer um is 10x when I'm in the in the space that I'm using grammarly versus you know without so there's a world now I can't even imagine not having grammarly with me and I say that from a professional lens um but yeah Eddie what what are your what what are your thoughts I have a whole bunch um I'm trying to summarize real quick to some I guess key thoughts I mean like back to my letter writing um example um you know there are times where you really want your voice present you know but I think you know if you a lot of people who are department heads or are in leadership positions you you might have an assistant who would write a draft for you and then you would just edit and make some changes I think that having AI do a draft is pretty much the same thing where you can ensure that your your voices that there are times where you know uh I I care less about my voice you know I think um and there are times where I'm very I I care about it deeply you know I um in fact as I as a first generation college student from Appalachia I found that there was a time where I tried to write away from that voice that you know I grew up with and now I'm trying to kind of find myself back to it and actually I've been um for about the past month I've been playing with grammarly and it's made me far more aware of sort of like nuances that maybe I do or I don't want in my voice um like I write just because of where I'm from the passive voice and sentence structure that's kind of how I I write so I'm now making choices like oh for this for this note to a colleague I'm happy to continue to be uh Eddie from Virginia and then there's other times where I need this to be more professional so I think a lot of us do a lot of code switching you know you speak in a certain voice in a certain context and there's times where it's more important or less important so I think that's part of what AI literacy is for us in the future is recognizing that there's a a matrix a calculus regarding when it's important for us to have our voice in a certain way and when it isn't and I think some of these Technologies are helping us see that making transparent to us like this is what you're doing do you do you want to do that in this letter to the president of this un univers do you want to do this um in this email to um a colleague or a student um so I feel it it's empowering and enables us more Choice um and also enables us to go it doesn't matter right now this I'm not care I don't care about voice I care about getting this done like I had someone ask me for a letter of um support for a grant and I was like sure I can do that when do you need it they said tomorrow so for me it was more important to get it done and to have dinner with my family rather than to hold on to so again it's it's I think it's a really a matrix and there's a lot of decision cells that we're in as we think through why and when we would want to maintain our certain identity so you're maintaining a position of complete control knowing that you've got the flexibility to use the tool in a way that enhances you based on your own judgment every day so I love that um I know we're wrapping up here uh just another uh plug for Eddie and his team at AAC andu if you would like to learn more about um AI pedagogy and and Innovative curriculum please do apply it looks like you guys have up six days to get your teams together and um I want to thank everybody Eddie I really want to thank you for the conversation spoiler alert I'd love a part two with you maybe here coming up so um everybody look for that and um Everybody thanks for coming having have a wonderful day and then uh here's to uh some summer Innovation around curriculum cheers",unknown
OgmOIAxaI00,"good morning good afternoon good evening everyone and welcome I hope you enjoyed a little Moonshadow on this Eclipse week and you're welcome in advance for not subjecting you for another rendition of Total Eclipse of the Heart I'm sure everybody is quite sick of that song at this point but we wanted to stay at least relatively on theme with Eclipse week this is our second of two webinars focused on the future of writing in the AI era today's webinar is going to be on Pro proc over output how AI refines the future of writing pedagogy and we'll get into content in just a second here but before doing so just a few housekeeping items as we usually tend to do all attendees are automatically muted at the moment thank you everybody for putting in where you're coming from today it's great to see that in the chat as soon as we're done with this particular Slide the chat will be turned off but you can use the Q&A widget at any time to type in any questions panelists and moderators will be able to see them and we will do our best to address as many as we can before the top of the hour so I know this goes till 45 Alex and I will be available to stick on for a few minutes after the 45 minute Mark to take as many questions as possible um if you want to enable close captioning just click the CC button at the bottom of your webinar window and as always we will follow up with a recording of This webinar after the event so um just to give you a sense of how we're going to spend the next 35 to 40 minutes and then get to Q&A we're going to do some quick intros we will examine the current state of writing in the nent AI era by looking at some thirdparty research and comments from subject matter experts then we'll get a little bit abstract but hopefully helpfully so by looking at writing as a process to preserve and then get a little future State oriented with Alex taking us through um a preview of a grammarly product release that really hits at the collaboration between humans and Ai and then like I said we will save time for some questions so as to who I am my name is Cliff Archie and I am a lead product marketing manager for Education institutions and students here at grammarly essentially all that means is that it's my job to listen to and understand the education market and then take insights back to our product teams that we build and continue to iterating on a product that really meets the needs of students and Educators alike but I am far less interesting and certainly not nearly as tall as our other speaker today Alex chevchenko he is one of grammarly's co-founders and he remains a very influential and crucial voice here at grammarly as a product leader while grammarly has grown to be much more than just an academic writing assistant over the past 15 years Alex remains very passionate about edtech and in serving our students and institutional customers so today's topic on the future of writing was an IDE ideal opportunity to bring him in so Alex welcome and please introduce yourself to our audience thanks cliff and hi everyone so as Cliff mentioned I co-founded gramly almost 15 years to the date with a friend of mine who's still my current colleague Max Lin today I'm the head of core product which essentially means I get to work on the fun future development for the core uh grammarly assistant that underpins most of the and user engagement um that you may know grammarly for for today uh to do that job well um I need to understand how our assistive capabilities um Can best augment human abilities so this topic is very relevant to what I do uh every day it's also relevant because of our origin story uh gr was founded originally to be a writing system primarily for ESL students my co-founder I are not native English speakers so having a tool that could uh help us communicate more accurately was key to us and we saw very fast adoption and relevance and education early on uh we've come a long way since um since then and I'll talk about that in a in a bit but I'm still very passionate about education about attack and a lot of hearing from our education customers so I'm very happy to to be here today and talk about the future of Friday great thanks Alex and please do bear with me as um the audience is going to be subjected to my voice for a while here but I'm going to bring you in momentarily so um stick with me as um we get into the content we wanted to start with just a question that we grammarly have been grappling with our ourselves over the past several months and I'm sure a number of audience members have as well and this is the question of does gen present an existential threat to the value of writing now it probably comes as no surprise that we're asking this because the reality is that when a within a few days and weeks of chat GPT being made public in November of 2022 higher education students were prompting it to create passible five paragraph essays that were proxies for actual knowledge demonstration and this rightfully so sent Educators and highered institutions into a bit of a spiral asking questions like what are the applications for writing when getting good enough text on the page is easier than it's ever been before now grammarly's position as we will talk about in more depth later on is a resounding no to this particular question a perspective that I'm confidently we probably share with a lot of you but we didn't just arrive at that conclusion via some form of wishcasting we talked to many of our customers we talked to subject matter experts we got views of technologists of the market in general and what's clear is that there's a lot of nuance behind this particular question and Nuance that we hope to clarify for all of you today um just want to briefly pause and look back at our first webinar on the future of writing at the end of February because that was more of a thought leadership higher level conversation around where the future of writing is headed and implications of AI on writing in general and we asked a very open-ended question of our audience around how you are feeling about the future of writing the good thing is that roughly 61% of our thousand attendees at the time felt quite optimistic about the future of writing on the flip side you can take that data point to say you know a significant portion of higher ed and K12 stakeholders are either neutral they don't know how to feel about the future of writing or they're pessimistic about it and so our hope today is that by taking you through this framework by having Alex showcase an example of what collaborating with AI in the reading process could look like in the future will help you leave more optimistic than you did when you came in and give you some considerations to take back to your institutions that can translate that optimism into action so um in terms of what informed the insights that we will share today um we got to this point via a number of different data points and interactions so I mentioned before that we talked to a number of subject matter experts these are subject matter experts who had some familiarity with gramarly but not in every case and what they all shared is that they've all taught in higher education they all research writing and ai's impact on writing and they all have a very strong point of view about what the future of writing holds so we'll share some of those insights momentarily but we also looked at third party and owned data and research as well as historical precedence so what are some examples of technological disruption that transform the writing process in the past what can we learn from that and then finally what do our customers think in this present moment what are they struggling with what are their opinions we talked to a number of our nearly 3,000 education customers for grammarly for education to really glean more insights informing what you're going to see today and so just to to start out with the data and research piece of this um we'll look at some industry Trends both in higher education and in the workplace and we'll start with higher education so back in November we ran a 2,000 person survey for just students half of the students in that survey were grammarly users and half were not and we just wanted to gauge their level of comfort in working with generative AI tools and you can see here nearly three4 of students in that survey said that they felt at least somewhat comfortable working with and using generative AI That's a little bit of a higher number than you may have seen in other studies but I think it is certainly reflective of the level of comfort that they have in using generative AI on a regular basis and we not only see this in higher education we also see it in high school and in students who just are beginning their journey in higher education with 64% of the class of 2027 that's the current freshman class saying that AI has at least somewhat impacted their academic plans as from an inside higher ed and student voice survey from January and another data point that is worth mentioning even though it's not on the slide from that survey is that 81% of that same class of 2027 said that they want their institutions to teach them how to ethically and effectively use AI in preparation for the Working World so that shows really good recognition from younger students that about how AI is transforming not only writing but transforming their future outlook on their careers and the workplace itself and that is good recognition because there's undeniable data to say that the workplace is transforming as we speak but it's not transforming in all the ways you may expect communication skills are still incredibly high demand from virtually every employer that you survey a June 2023 GMAC employer survey said that communic ation skills were the most important skills for graduates to possess 70% of those surveyed agreed with that statement and it just shows that communication and the ability to communicate across context is as important today in the generative AI era as it has been in the past and if we consider why that's the case we'll look at additional data from the workplace and all three data points are from a grammarly sponsored Harris poll survey called the state of business community communication from uh this past February what's really interesting here is that this is a survey of knowledge workers so you can assume the vast majority of those surveyed have college degrees and knowledge workers are spending 88% of the work week just communicating that may not be wholly surprising because if you think about knowledge work in general in 2024 a lot of people are in hybrid work environments where they may be spending a lot of time on Zoom as we are today they may be in in-person meetings um so all of that is communication and that's fair enough but perhaps the stat that was most striking to me personally is that knowledge workers are spending almost half their entire work weeks just on writing tasks 19 hours per week devoted to writing tasks and that is a considerable amount of time writing slack messages to fellow colleagues creating emails writing project briefs if you're in marketing or on product you can go down a Litany of different tasks but the takeaway here is that knowledge workers across sectors are writing a lot in the workplace today and it probably comes as no surprise then that AI driven tools are really a Avenue for Business Leaders to invest and to boost employee productivity with 82% of Business Leaders saying they plan to invest in aiid driven tools by 2025 so significant significant majorities investing in AI specifically for productivity in the very near future if they have not done so already and what is particularly interesting if we look at year-over-year insights from the Harris poll grammarly does sponsor this um and has for the last three years every year we see the volume of communication in the workplace increasing and the quality of that communication decreasing what that means is that all these tools that employees and companies are adding to their Tech Stacks are just creating more opportunity for noise and for communication to be sent in all kinds of different places but that doesn't mean that the communication itself is resonating with the intended audience is impactful and is helping scale productivity and efficiency across the workplace so there's a real opportunity for AI tools and generative AI to streamline that and create efficiencies but that efficiency is only going to be gained if the end users AKA future graduates understand how to work with these tools effectively and understand what a good effective writing output actually looks like and so that brings us to conversations that we had with subject matter experts now this is not exhaustive and we do have a future of writing ebook that launched a couple weeks ago that my colleagues will share in the chat for you all to check out if you haven't already that have more insights from subject matter experts but couple quotes that I think are rep representative of the Dynamics that we are facing particularly in higher ed the first comes from Steven Monroe who's the chair of writing and rhetoric department at the University of Mississippi and was a guest speaker on our February webinar he says brilliant people didn't become brilliant by letting generative AI write for them the technology is astonishing and very useful but writing is still the ultimate learning tool and I think a way of just extending that is you know particularly in the workplace everybody who's using these tools effectively now have a basic understanding of what good writing looks like and they have the evaluation skills to be able to make the most of them because they actually learned how to write and they learned the value of writing to creative thinking to critical thinking when they were in high school and hopefully an undergrad and that allows them to use these tools more effectively you can't replace that just by jumping straight to using generative AI tools to replicate that process and I think the opinion of John Warner is particularly striking here he is a former College instructor he's a columnist regular columnist and inside higher ed and he's been known to be skeptical of the value of generative AI in the writing process and he says if chat jpt can do it and if the purpose is learning it's not worth doing I think just another way of saying this is we very frequently in higher education for a long time use writing as a way of demonstrating Baseline knowledge and Baseline understanding of content obviously generative AI tools do that quite well in the modern era and so we need to redefine what writing is used for and the value that writing has to a more comprehensive and impactful learning process and I think to that end Sid doin summarizes it quite well when he says we need to teach students how to use AI as a collaborator in such a way that they can accomplish more than they could have without using it and at the same time maintain authority over these tools so really just thinking about using generative AI tools to augment the writing process to augment human expertise I know that that is something that is cited in a lot of different places but I think it's particularly relevant when it comes to how writing works with AI to augment the ideas that the person wants to put on the page and so um this is a good synopsis of some of the conversations we had with subject matter experts but now I want to turn to historical precedent and I should say that um we looked at a much longer time Horizon of technological disruption to writing going back all the way to the printing press but for the sake of today's conversation we chose to look at grammarly's Evolution as a more recent example and this is not certainly an Apples to Apples comparison to what is happening right now with generative AI but gry's journey is instructive when it comes to the notion that writing as a practice often evolves along side technology and so Alex you know bringing you back into the fold here I'd love to get your perspective as a technologist and a co-founder on what we can learn about the nature of Technology adoption and evolution and specifically zooming in on how the education Community responded to grammarly when you launched it 15 years ago sure um so grammarly was originally launched as a grammar and spelling assistant primarily for students and given that my co-founder and I are Ukrainian as an assistant to help English language Learners like ourselves write more accurately in English um we were focused on the end user the writers however what we did not expect was the the eager adoption of grammarly by Educators uh teachers started recommending gram to students and incorporating uh our product into their curriculum uh pretty early early on in our Evolution even before we launched our freemie model in back in 2015 uh so while we were helping um our original Target user students we pivoted to start building um uh building on our tool to help meet more of the needs of teachers and uh and professors so this this represents and important phenomenon in technology adoption especially for for this audience who will play a pivotal role in shaping the future writing uh so product developers produce technology with an idea for how it can be used is the users students and Educators in in in this case who ultimately determine how it will be used or it if it will even be used we call this uh product Market fits uh that is why these somewhat abstract conversations are really important we as technology users play a significant role uh in how technology um is adopted yeah um I think that feedback from end users is super important um and speaking of that you know early on grammarly's grammar error detection I'm sure caused some instructors even though you know they were generally supportive to your point to have reservations about that particular technology limiting skill development from students or replacing the role of human instructors to help teach effective spelling and grammar now over time certainly in conversations that I've been a part of with customers that those reservations have become muted because there's a broader recognition that you know using AI to help with spelling and grammar allows students to focus on the more important aspects of writing so my question to you is just what lessons do you think the grammarly adoption Trends to that end hold for generative AI particularly in education yeah I mean adoption of graml was was quick but not near the pace of or level of adoption of gener of AI I'll talk more about that in a second so the the main point of showing this timeline is not to bore you with all the product features we've launched in the in in the past 15 years but illustrate how technology evolved alongside writing and how writers and Educators appetite to use technology new ways continued to uh to evolve as we were building our products so the bar at the center represents this Evolution gramly was one of the first writing systems um on the market and for the first decades writers really looked on techn uh uh really um only looked to Technology support to help with accuracy of writing however um around 2019 we started to recognized a larger paino primarily among business professionals who were looking for support to write more effectively and confidently as writing became a bigger part of the digitally connected workplace professionals needed to get better at blending the words they chose for their intended audience this this led to new technology like tone detection and uh and Clarity uh Clarity analysis uh similarly to accuracy in 2009 the the education Community was very eager to incorporate quality um assistant features into their writing um uh curriculum I believe the education Community was very open to these features because they they were uh they they clearly augmented writing rather than automated it we also fully understood what the technology did and how it fit neatly into the the writing process so just last question before we take some of your comments and try to make sense of it for the the current moment we're living in um you know 2022 23 we introduced generative AI it came on the heels of um chat gpt's launch what feels different this time around and what feels similar to you oh sure um so well uh first of all deploying new geni capabilities aligns where gramly as a technology uh company and our users have been involving towards so the next stage of quality assistance is helping communicators write in a way that resonates deeply With Their audience General fi has tremendous tremendous potential to help writers consider the full context of their communication to make sure it transfers information and meaning as effectively as possible to others it does feel in a way it does feel different though uh in a as a sheer pace of adoption and magnitudes of disruption so for example all the changes I just discussed happened over the course of 15 years there's a lot of innovation but it was a you know a 15 years time span jifi AI has potentially gone through more change in the last 15 months so what is particularly different different in the nature of General fbii it's a proactive technology as opposed to more passive technology that has traditionally been used for U for writing assistance yeah and I think that's a good segue Alex into just our view from a you know leveraging a proactive technology like this and how it can balance out between learning priorities particular in higher education our our view is that written communication will be a human-led collaboration with AI but for that collaboration to actually level up writing and communication on the whole everyone will need to possess a strong understanding of writing and of context because the reality is as we talked a bit before when it came to some of our workplace statistics and research students and eventual graduates in to the workforce can't make the most of AI if they don't emerge from their formal education with skills like understanding your own individual voice critical thinking point of view writing for specific audiences and certainly the ability to evaluate effective communication that is needed to be impactful communicators across a wide variety of different use cases and so with the prevalence of AI assistance in virtually every writing surface that you encounter online it's important to think about the writer not as solely a writer anymore but as content owners content owners who may depend on AI to compose low stakes texts in one context things like just writing a quick email response Etc and act as solely a reviewer or final check in another where they actually compose all the text and then just turn to AI as a last mile support in any scenario however content owners are responsible for what ultimately gets submitted and so possessing a keen understanding of what good writing and communication looks like ac across a wide variety of context matters now more than it ever has and so let's let's continue down this path and develop a bit of a loose framework here um we get understandably very fixated on output not only in higher education but in the workforce and the reality is that good and effective communication involves a lot more than just the output but output is ultimately the thing that gets evaluated and it's the thing that's consumed it's also the phase that is most disrupted by generative AI to date because a student can easily turn to a generative AI tool to generate output and feain Content Mastery even if they don't necessarily possess that knowledge independent of an AI output and so let's consider what's lost if students on the whole take that sort of path headed in the future it means that you lose a lot of the value that happens before you get to Output the ability to identify your audience Define what goals you have investigate and research existing body of knowledge and explore New Perspectives there's a lot of difficult but highly valuable work that is happening in the writing process phase before any text is actually typed or entered into the page and we also jumping directly to Output lose the value of composition the power and the transferable skills that happen when you organize your thoughts on a page when you try to construct your own arguments based on your goals when you craft narratives that are aligned to what your audience needs to hear and sure generative AI can do at least some of these things decently well but particularly for younger people who don't have deep experience recognizing and defining what compelling outputs look like foregoing composition Al together weakens the muscles that are necessary to evaluate what a good and impactful output actually look like and what the next step is which is how to reflect on the quality of writing that has been generated before you actually get to the point of submission evaluating accuracy pressure testing the quality of that writing against your goals and assessing the effectiveness for your target audience so fundamentally if students foro the writing process composition and critical reflection phases they lose out on the core learning opportunities that John Warner and others were referencing on previous slides and they failed to develop the type of recognition and evaluative skills that are needed to work effectively with generative AI systems in the immediate and long term and skipping to Output really foregoes something that we heard again and again in our conversations not only with customers but also with those subject matter experts and that is the notion of the struggle the idea that learning and practicing a strong writing process allows students to develop important skills like critical thinking Clarity of thought the art of investigation and so much more and that there's inherent Challenge and struggle in doing that work but bypassing those critical stages students lose the opportunity to hone their writing ability and carve out their own competitive Advantage as communicators and so that really leads us into where is the upside here and what should the future of writing at least in our opinion look like well um as mentioned before we view this as a collaboration but it's one that every writer regardless of whether you're a student a faculty member a professional needs to calibrate based on context and based on the intention behind the particular communication that is being written so in this case we see a chart that just has a Continuum where you might be wholly dependent on yourself to write and send something in certain cases and in other context you may let AI do a lot of the leg work in composing because it's lower stakes in most scenarios we feel that there's going to be a mix and a blended approach here and that the calibration will be very different for every communication because of how contextual communication is so highly academic writing will hopefully continue to be heavily human L with AI acting as a reviewer feedback partner source of liation support some of the things that we will get to before the the end of this webinar repetitive communication tasks like replying to a wrote email submitting a project review those May lean more heavily towards the right hand side of the screen in the automated aspect with a quick check from the content owner before they actually complete it and send it but what's abundantly clear again is that students in k12 and higher ed need guidance and training from instructors to develop a clear sense of when using generative AI is used useful and effective and when it's important to rely on human composition and process and so just to round this out with the framework all in one particular Continuum slide um the calibration is really pivotal moving forward AI can be helpful not only in generating output but in working with the human content owner throughout the various writing stages helping them understand who their target audience is how to Define goals that are going to resonate with that audience how to construct narratives that will really drive the point across and during the critical reflection phase how to assess the effectiveness of the writing aligned to those original goals and so we envision a AI writing partner that can help all writers spend more of their human effort tailoring compelling messages to specific audiences in the moment wherever they are writing that is one of the advantages of grammarly is that it's ubiquitous and it works in every writing surface We Believe AI can actually enhance the process composition and reflection phases while empowering humans to create their best possible output for every context and this leads us into the last phase of the webinar where we're going to show a bit of a future State um with a feature we just actually launched to business customers called strategic suggestions it's been trained on a rich Corpus of business writing and will expand to other domains like academic writing in the very near future so Alex I'm going to turn it over to you to talk more about strategic suggestions as it stands today how it relates to this sort of Continuum and support in the process composition and critical reflection phases and where we could possibly take this when it comes to academic writing in the future awesome let stock product so um as Cliff mentioned um we actually just launched um sort of a next generation of gramar assistants we a feature we call Strategic suggestions it's um very in line with what Cliff has been outlining in terms of a real-time writing collaboration between a human and Ai and we are rolling it out uh first to our business users and customers to address a very real pinpoint that has been increasing since General AI began being adopted by organizations uh in in in large numbers uh so that is that is reducing the fla of ineffective communication for the sake of better communication uh strategic suggestions work with the human writer in the background understanding based on what you've written who your target audience is and what the end goal of your communication is so we look at all these factors and then proactively nudge the user before they arrive at a finished output to consider improving their communication B based on gaps that grammarly hasent identified So based on the framework that Clive covered you can imagine a world today for professionals where grma is helping to level up the process composition and reflection phases of writing while still giving them the users Ultimate control um this is only available today on business writing but we wanted to share a bit bit more about this because it could certainly be trained on academic writing to extend this this this future of writing framework to students and um faculty members um so flipping the slides um I wanted to talk a little bit about the collaboration with grammarist writing assistant so just to quickly you know demonstrate how this feature supports the collaborative writing process today for business writing let's look at few examp examples of very common writing in the in the workplace so the type of communication that students today will be expected to do as soon as they enter the uh the workplace you know you can imagine use cases like writing an email posting a teams or slack message creating a project brief you name it um so in this example you can see that uh the professional salesperson is trying to set up a demo with a customer they draft the email and they're doing so um uh as they're doing so gramal picks up that they're writing to a customer and that the goal is to get them to set up a time for a damal so in that way GRL is in the backgrounds uh activating the process phase that we previously covered there's just one problem with the email the salesperson has not given the customer a reason to want to accept the invite uh GRL gently nudges the Sal person with a suggestion that says uh describe the benefits of the demo call so your client knows to prioritize it again the writer did not have to specify any of this grammarly perceived it infert it based on the understanding of this type of customer facing Outreach and was able to proactively nudge the writer to uplevel their communication and prevent an unnecessary back and forth uh so flipping to the uh the the next slide um so here is um here is an example of um a strategic suggestions helping in the composition phase um and specifically around constructing core messages that resonate so in this specific case a professional is making a recommendation to their management they want to get their Buy in on the proposed to partner with a third party but grammarly recognizes that they haven't specified the cost again it not just um it's not just the user the writer uh helping them construct a better argument and deliver a more impactful uh core message um so flipping to collaborating with grammarist writing assistant um uh so the the the CR critical reflection part this is slide 21 Cliff yep yep um and so when it comes to um to critical reflection here is an example of a more senior leader writing a message to their team uh the message is a difficult one so there're scrapping um a project that the team spend a lot of a lot of time on in this case grammarly helps the leader rephrase their writing to be more empathetic and given their the likely frustrations their team has has over the decision again the leader was ultimately in the driver seat here but gry was sitting in the backgrounds and stepping stepping in when seeing an opportunity to uplevel the quality and effectiveness of the difficult message they were trying to deliver so the leader could could have missed the suggestion but at least had the benefit of Gram's AI serving as a reflection partner and uh final substantive um check on how their communication would resonate With Their audience and um kind of moving on um we're really excited to to talk about uh you know a different different application of the technology we're we're we're building that um that could definitely be used for for academic writing so what I'm about to show you is still in development and will continue to be fine-tuned with input from our education customers but even in this prototype stage and please don't mind the user uh interface here it is a prototype uh so even at this stage it provides a good example how contextually wear technology can assist in the human and ey collaborative writing process so on the screen is an experimental UI populated with an example history writing assignment on the influences of the uh American Revolution again as I mentioned the look and feel will evolve to fit uh into how and where writers actually write so it's not uh it's kind of writing surface agnostic so uh Gram's General approach is to work where our users uh you know work and wres um but but but this this this interface is to give you an idea of the what what's kind of possible from the kind of workflow uh standpoint so um you can you can you can um you can imagine that this UI will evolve to fit into into how and where you know the different topics that that students write about but but but also the the goal here is to uh illustrate how students can collaborate with ji for academic writing so on the left um you uh you have an essay on the influence of the Enlightenment um era on the American Revolution just one example but this could be really done with any student writing in in this demo environments we've set up you can hit evaluate and in the background gram will infer the outcome or goal of um of of the writing as well as the target audience uh without about the the end user uh having to specify it uh and while gram today hasn't been trained to understand the nuances of student writing for class course you can see it does a decent job of recognizing this asset goal is to ex is to explain um uh and it's been written for a scholarly uh audience um so yeah if you could click thank you uh so next grammarly analyzes the strengths and areas of improvements for the writing as a whole so Grammy identifies the good stuff um uh and uh so you you you you can see the the the items that um the product has identified here as as kind of you know positives um and it even singles out specific strength and explains the reasons behind the strengths in the in the uh of the outputs um so kind of moving on um then gramly tries to help the writer identify areas to improve so in this particular case gry recognizes that the thesis is a bit vague and it does doesn't really have a strong point of view it's clear that the ideas of John Loy and and and Russo played a significant role um that does not not really say anything interesting and gr's guidance here is pushing the writer to level up their point of view in the um uh in the thesis statement to strengthen the level of Engagement through the rest of the essay um gonna switch into the next next slide um another example um where you could see this helping students in particular is around substantive citation support you can see the the suggestion uh gets at the why behind a frequently annoying task for students and that is properly and clearly sting sources in this case graml gets the uh the impact of excluding in TX citation detail uh this could raise questions about credibility of information make it harder for readers to locate the original sources um you'll notice that all of the feedback shown thus far uh supports either the process U or critical reflection reflection phases of writing that that we talked about earlier none of the insights uh or suggestions are actually helping with composition or to improve the output the ideal state is having each institution train the tool on their specific guidelines providing a tailored education uh educational experience so it we uh Gramm would give an education institution total control of what the kind of criteria and parameters and variables of this of this output would be what students would see so I could certainly foresee a world in which the the insights are turned on by default for all users however it could be up to the institution and potentially even up to the specific Professor or faculty member to enable composition features that enable the end user to act upon these suggestions um so flip to the the the next slide um and and certainly we believe that making those insights immediately actionable for students could be uh a value add to this human AI collaboration but it should be in the right contexts you could um you can see here that there is a suggested prompt in this interaction that pushes the author to highlight what makes their argument unique um so here grammarly actually provides a a suggestion in this specific case there's also a suggestion from grammarly to enrich the conclusion with compelling insights this is Mo moving the writing forward and helping to enhance the output but as we mentioned ultimately the the student writer as the content owner of uh in this case we will'll need to determine in if grammarly's compositional support fits their goals and style and faculty members will have to align these types of suggestions with the goal of the assignments so I'll I'll pass it back to Cliff to close us out but I as I do I I just want to re reiterate that this is still in the in the development stage uh so as educational educational leaders um I mean you you as educational leader play a big role at this moment uh in time to help inform what the future of writing will look like and where technology needs to evolve to best afford it I hope to hear more from our educational stakeholders as we continue building this so thanks for letting me preview it a bit uh today thanks so much Alex and again I I hope um that was instructive as a way of sort of bringing the framework to life through a product perspective um you can see that there's a pull up on your screen right now um jumping ahead to the last point you know grammarly is actively thinking about how to empower content owners as we covered today to stay in Creative control while proactively leveling up their thinking and so if you want to talk to a salesperson about how grammarly can help your institution responsibly embrace the future of writing please respond in the poll that's now open on your screen and as we get to Q&A I just want to repeat some of the key takeaways here so if we look at historical precedent we know there have been numerous disruptions to how writing was previously done over time and Gram's case is particularly instructive even if it is imperfect because it shows that you know Finding product Market fit getting the support of instructors um really takes time but it also helps inform developing a product and developing a piece of technology in the case of generative AI that is actually going to meet Market needs and that of learning outcomes and writing will remain a prerequisite for practical AI skill so that to me is the biggest reason for optimism in this entire discussion because without a strong sense of what good writing entails it would be very difficult to make good use of generative AI tools in the real world and the last piece here is that we are really thinking about how to shift the traditional role of a writer to being more of a Content owner allowing them to evaluate and improve upon generative AI output while understanding the tasks and context for when to lean heavily on AI vers sparingly and so again if you want to talk to grammarly about this please respond to the poll um and we will take a few questions before we get to the full top of the hour um got a number of questions here um just taking so one one piece here um that Mary asks is I'm curious about ideas for using AI early in the writing process especially for generating an outline or thinking about structure um it's a great question that we get often you can think about generative AI as a tool for ideation and brainstorming support going back to um just if you bear with me on clicking back to that um process phase generally can be extremely impactful and helpful in this regard um we have added brainstorming capabilities into our product with inline suggestions around if you're looking to construct an outline you're looking to brainstorm topics for your assignment um you're thinking about how to research those are all student Centric preset prompts that we have in our assistant right now um and it's just an example of how a lot of different generative AI tools are helping spawn creativity and curiosity and inquiry at the beginning of the writing process so that when you get to the point of writing text it it is much more informed and it's given much more thought to what the goals of your writing are what you're trying to convey and who your audience is um so those are just some examples and you can obviously play with that in the grammarly assistant at any point in time it's a available with more prompts if you're on a grammarly for Education license but it's available in our free offering as well so feel free to experiment um just looking here one question that we got asked a lot both before and during this webinar is around detection um and so Margaret asks how equipped is grammarly to check if AI has generated writing I am not the best person to answer that Alex is a very good person to answer that um so Alex do you have a a thought around that um sure yeah it's it's a it's a great question definitely it's uh it's a question that's uh on top of many many people's minds now um and um we're actually building uh something in this space and we feel that graml is uniquely positioned to um uh to to play a role and to to to to be a factor in this kind of decision making process whether human or a robot wrote text because grammarly is embedded in in in the in the writing process so it's not taken a state of uh of a of a written text and runs runs an AI model to determine whether AI wrote this like it's it's done today with very very kind of questionable uh results um so we the the the the the the track that's ongoing here within grammarly we are actively researching this and and and taking it to to uh you know to a productization stage is basically you know uh embedding because graml is an application that's that's running in our users machines we can and um uh factually establish Providence of text uh being written so whenever whenever we see that uh you know human has touched this keys on the on the keyboard enroll this uh this word that turned into a sentence that turned into paragraph that that turned into a text we we can we can sign it as written by that specific signed in to grammar the user so we call this digital Providence and uh the the more gener AI is the more gener AI is used for more for more use cases the more this problem of establishing Providence of human work will uh uh the more cute it will be and you know the technology that we're bu building here we feel uh very soon will be in the center of establishing this this this this Providence so stay tuned there like there will be very interesting updates uh on on on on this topic very soon yeah um we will definitely be revisiting that in the fall so um to Alex's Point stay tuned on that front um this is a really interesting question from John how will AI have an understanding of what is factually accurate and morally right and wrong what's the source of this understanding um Alex I want your take on that as a technologist I I think if you you are following a lot of the model coverage from Google from Claude from open AI from Microsoft um you'll notice that each of the large language models that are being developed have a bit of a different flavor and to the second part of your question what's the source of this understanding the truth of the matter is that each of these models is being informed by their developers and they have a certain perspective that those developers take in building the product so um there's a great podcast that I would recommend from The New York Times and the Ezra Klein show where um he talks to Ethan mik from the University of Pennsylvania about this very point and the fact that each of these models just has a a bit of a um bias lens from the perspective of the Creator I would say you know it's a little bit uh hazardous to assign Mor morality to any of these models because they are just representations of their creators and of the large Corpus that they've been trained on um but I'm not sure Alex if you have a particular perspective on this no that's that's that that's a good take on this and the only thing I would add is there's there's always an opportunity um um to tune a model the output of a model in in in in postprocessing to align it with the uh you know with the definition of you know factual correctness or the definition of you know ethical or what's ethical or what's moral uh so that the the output would be uh it's U sort of tuned accordingly it's called you know responsible Ai and and responsible AI is as as a truck it's it's kind of like you know it's it's part of the foundational model to what Cliff has described but it's also a part of what's what's what's possible uh to to add to the model in the postprocessing so meaning what the output of the model is basically you know tuned accordingly and so at gramarly we we work uh very closely with the foundational model uh providers you know including open Ai and and Google and we work very closely with their responsible AI teams but we have our own and uh so for example like in in in like an open AI uh if you if you ask uh the model just you know write me an essay on this topic it will write you an essay grammar um this is this something that grammarly will will will respond as like as a uh as an AI model I I cannot do it for like here are some ideas on how you can start writing NY but I will not write an ny for you right so this is not something that's coming from the foundational model it's something that gramling is basically applying on top so this this tuning layer is a very very uh just yet another opportunity for gramar to kind of collaborate with a with a client education institution and kind of build a better product together yeah that's a great Point um I know we are almost at the top of the hour there's one quick question that I can answer that I saw from Glenn who asked how will prompt engineering interface with students learning how to develop main ideas and thesis statements um we previously linked to the future of writing report that we published last month there's a whole section in that future of writing uh report from University of New Mexico that talks about the clear framework for prompt engineering so definitely check out the future of writing report for more insight into how prompt engineering can help develop with main ideas and thesis statements um I think there's a lot more um just professional development and and training for students and for faculty members around how to teach that with prompt engineering but there's a lot of good work happening out of the University of New Mexico and a broader Consortium of librarians around prompt engineering that's worth checking out um we really appreciate everybody's time um we know this is a meeting discussion and a lot of us talking at you but um we hope that you have some really good takeaways and considerations from the future of writing want to thank Alex for sharing the grammarly product perspective on this um and we look forward to speaking with you again in the very near future have a great rest of the week everybody",unknown
J5e-clEnkws,all right welcome everybody I love seeing where everyone's coming in from all over the world we're so excited for today's webinar which is the future of AI and uh before we get St started I would love just to remind everybody that all attendees are going to be automatically muted uh we will have designated time to address questions toward the end of the webinar uh you can submit questions at any time using the Q&A widget and the moderators and the panelists will have access to the questions and we're going to uh try to save as much time as possible so we can address uh as many of those questions at the end of our webinar today to enable close captioning you're going to click the CC button at the top of your webinar window and finally this webinar will be recorded and we will follow up with the recording and send it out via email thank you all right well let's get started we have two great great guests today and a little hint about our guests was in the the music of BB King um before I introduce them I just want to start by setting some brief context of all the aspects of teaching and learning and working that have been disrupted since generative AI uh was introduced to us about 18 months ago perhaps the most obvious disruption has been with writing and when you have tools like chat GPT that can write for you it's obvious that the active writing should be subject to change but how well we're going to evaluate that today and considering uh we have a growing Suite of tools that can write for us what is this value of change uh how will writing be be taught going forward and what skills are going to be most relevant to students to be informed productive and creative members of both society and as employees in a world which is going to be so heavily focused on written communication uh and what do those necessary skills mean for writing instructions in k12 and higher ed so lots to discuss today before we get going a reminder that grammarly has been in this space for 15 years uh as a trusted uh companion to writing and we're really excited to share our Viewpoint about how these tools uh shouldn't actually replace the general understanding and competencies around writing but how we can continue to evolve more empathetic creative um content managers if you will of our students and employees all right well let's get going um we always start these webinars with a poll so please humor us as we launch our first poll we want to hear from you we want to know what is your role H in within your organization and then we want to know a little pulse check how are you feeling right now about the future of writing in education and go ahead and fill that out and while we wait for your responses to come in I am so excited to introduce our guests um before I do so I am Jenny Maxwell I am the head of education at grammarly and this is the first time that I'm going to be joined by not one but two distinguished panelists and they both hail from the University of Mississippi first up is Step Moore Steph is the chair and assistant professor of writing and rhetoric at the University of Mississippi uh in his many hats Stephen co-chair the AI writing working group at um which plans and Pilots new pedagogies and a published author he brings a lot of personal and professional expertise to this topic so Stephen we are so excited to welcome you alongside Stephen is Mark Watkins Mark is an academic Innovation fellow and lecturer of writing and rhetoric at the University of Mississippi he serves as the Director of AI as the uh director of the AI Institute for teachers of writing at um and co-chairs the AI working group with within writing and rhetoric Department he's written and researched extensively about Ai and education so welcome Mark welcome Steven together they are helping to implement responsible AI across the writing and rhetoric departments and their efforts at um were featured in a lengthy Washington Post story which got our attention uh and then we'll link that into the chat for those of you that didn't see it so happy to have you gentlemen Hi how are you guys today hi Jenny happy to be here hi Jenny so great to see you nice to see you both um so I'd love us to just start we have a a lot of uh great questions that were submitted before today's uh webinar so there's a massive amount of interest from the audience I just want to start very broadly just to set the entry point for this conversation in your opinions so this is the big question here what value do you see as write for for writing in this current ERA and Mark let's start with you first well I think writing is going to be um a very powerful tool going forward uh with generative Ai and also without it um we teach writing as a process and as part of our daily practice and our routines and that's not something that's going to just change with the next new tool or technology that comes out um what came to my attention just yesterday is the co-president of open AI Greg Brockman he tweeted a wonderful uh tweet about writing itself too and he said that it's fun be writing something in a rapid cycle of feeling confused figuring out feeling confused on a new problem then figuring out that one too and often finding new insights to earlier problems so when the co-president of the largest gender Val company talks about the value of writing too through its own process too I think we can t say very safely that text generation uh will be a powerful tool to help us augment it but it's not going to fully replace writing as a process or a practice and what we do for our day-to-day lives um we talk about writing in terms of of just uh reflective reflecting our own practice and what that means to us too so I think it's going to be and remain a truly powerful part of our lives uh going forward and this new technology will uh find a place for it as we develop it I love that Stephen your thoughts here well I I love that example Greg brockman's brilliant and he and he didn't become brilliant um by letting generative AI read and write for him and and you know he's he he's testifying to the to the truth um that writing is is still the ultimate learning tool and so that fundamental reality for us as humans just has not changed um the the technology is astonishing and will be very useful um but but writing as a as a learning tool is is just as important as ever and and perhaps writing is more valuable than ever um the expository writing skills that we've been teaching in composition and rhetoric and in the humanities for decades are are suddenly enjoying a new moment of importance and good good prompt engineering is really just good writing good writing is good prompt engineering so if we want to get the most out of llms um Clarity conciseness specificity um these things that we've encouraging students to do forever are are are the path um to interacting successfully with the with with the large language models um so in in my opinion things are changing rapidly but some things are staying the same writing Remains the ultimate tool for Learning and it's just as important and profound as ever totally and and what's interesting is all of us as sort of seasoned adults um have had the the benefit of being able to if if we found Delight with these generative AI writing tools and we're interested and excited about trying them out that's predicated on years of foundational writing um experiences and being taught you know how to think critically about the process of writing so we can't assume that anyone going forward who doesn't have a foundation in writing will be able to use the tools as effectively as they are intentioned so I love that let's zoom in let's talk about uh writing as an assessment tool so this is obviously an area that has been tremendously disrupted over the last 18 months or so what is your view of using writing as an assessment tool in the AI era and how do you see that evolving over the next five years and Stephen we'll start with you yeah I think writing as an assessment tool has been compromised by the development of these new technologies and um all of us in in teaching are going to have to Grapple with with the new reality um and and reconsider much of what we do um in in the classroom and and uh especially how we assess student learning and and this is going to be a little bit of a pain uh the work's already underway but it will also be very healthy any anytime we think in new ways about our teaching um we get better as teachers and our our students benefit so obviously certain assessments are already outdated um I'm think of of those those oneoff um writing assessments that are really designed to um measure recall or or or memorization and and we're going to need to rethink those across our our disciplines um and and and and that's that's too bad because students do get a lot out of those um writing assignments you know they're they're they're reflecting and and learning and reine knowledge in ways that they don't when when they're responding to a multiple choice test let's say um but that's exactly why we we should not uh abandon writing entirely uh to the machines and and and and it's it shows why writing Remains the the best tool for processing reflecting um turning impersonal facts into personal meaning yeah what I I love that Mark what what commentary do you have about this yeah I think what Stephen saying is very accurate too the um future of those one-off exams what we would call in writing across curriculum terms of writing to report learning or writing to report knowledge are probably not going to survive long term and in point of fact a lot of Faculty were rethinking those types of Assessments long before generative a came out we were moving towards what's much more called authentic assessments too to talk talk about with their students with uh ways that they can actually apply their real world world learning and those skills about writing and other things too uh in different ways that don't just ask them to talk about uh writing about what they learned in a course the other side of the Corn is writing to learn which is what we were talking about earlier too in writing to talk about um your own personal reflection when you are learning something to putting that in context with your life and what you value uh is going to survive this and it's also going to show some um I think greater value as we continue going forward as a instructor who teaches both in person in face tace and online in hybrid courses too there are a variety of tools that we use uh currently that show this grammarly is one that my students use uh but I use a lot of tools like perusal and um hypothesis for online annotation I've used Microsoft's flip for asynchronous videos that uh don't involve necessarily using text but actually seeing your own students voices so there's lots of different tools and techniques you can use to um show your students different skills that are go beyond just writing um so I would not abandon writing as a process of this too but it is definitely something to start rethinking about our assessments as we go forward um and it is going to be a process this is not going to be a be like a sit down with we come to a professional development center with a your lunch or something else too there you get a tip it's going to have to be something that we think about and re-envision as we go forward um I want to double click on what you what you just mentioned around writing being a reflection tool um can you can you elaborate on on what you mean by that yeah so text generation isn't going to know anything about yourself you're not going to be able to ask chat GPT how your date was last night or your friend how they're doing to or anything else your ability to actually process the world is going to be as more powerful right now now than any time in the past history too because these new technologies um need people to actually use their own critical thinking skills to uh use them effectively and when we talk about reflection we're not just talking about this in terms of Academia we're talking about this to for actual workplace skills as well putting into context what you learn how you learn it and uh put the value on that is going to be a marketable skill going forward um I believe Microsoft's own um I I cannot the name iscap I think it's the future work Trends report talked about having critical thinking effective decision- making and reflection as being part of the future skills that people are going to need with generative Ai and um the actual Workforce Stephen any other thoughts on on this notion of reflection and and versus oneof writing reflection is so important for our students and and and when we write we all um it's it's always a recursive process we go back and forth we revise we reflect we we think about what we've written and um that's that's not how the large language models are producing text it's just a one pass production um and and so there's an interesting difference there between the the tech and the humans um but but reflection is fantastic uh for all of us and and and writing's the the best way to do that I I think um right now I'm feeling some pedagogical anxiety I think a lot of us are because some of the things that we've done and that have worked really well for a long time are going to need to be um rethought and but I'm but I'm trying to move to a place of of pedagogical creativity and the the workshops that have that we've we've run here that Mark's done such a brilliant job of of organizing and and that the post highlighted uh in those in those events I'm seeing teachers from all disciplines you know once they develop a level of AI literacy thinking really creatively about what they're doing in the classroom and and just down the hall uh from me guy creger who is a really super teacher of writing he's doing something this semester with his first year students he's having chat GPT uh produce a complete draft of an essay on a subject of their choosing and then he's he's working for a week or two the students work through you work through that draft revising it for all sorts of different um different things making rhetorical choices checking the the facts uh revising and rewriting it and improving the draft and so that's a that's a really interesting uh creative example of something that can be done in the classroom it it's it's sometimes difficult to teach revision um but we know revision is important and we know peer review is important so here guy has his students basically U doing peer review on chat GPT and they're responding well to that kind of assignment would not have been possible a year and a half again isn't that an incredible outcome right so I know when uh generative sort of made its way to the market and there was a lot of fear around um how the disrup ion would really eliminate um Integrity but what we're seeing is it's really opening the doors for uniquely human experiences uh especially around what you just described unlocking creativity creativity is a natural sort of first step to all forms of human Le Innovation and and opening up more spaces for students to be creative and and and to link those creative moments to writing courses must be really exciting for you as as an instructor um I it gives me a lot of optimism about what you know what experiences are going to look like across the campus but I do I I want to sort of also call out that um equally I know you you said what did you say something about a pedagogical anxiety um so while we're on that sort of part of this let's talk about the pedagogical anxiety as it relates to academic Integrity right this is a question that has been um that consistently comes up around the what if scenarios um a lot of our audience submitted questions in advance around AI detection how to prevent plagiarism with AI and writing assignments it's this it's this really meaty topic and it's something that is coming up um with regularity I'm sure many people on the webinar are acutely aware of recent um academic Integrity uh headlines that also involved grammarly um I will just call out that uh the grammarly response to recent developments um at the University of North Georgia will be addressed uh later today via Tik Tok so take you know be be on the watch there but I want to bring this up because it's it's something that I think concerns institutions and faculty and students alike so Mark let's just get some perspective from you on academic Integrity in the age of AI so this is the um issue that a lot of Faculty have been talking about Beyond just writing studies too virtually every Department to on our campus and I'm not just talking about uh text generation we have computer data science teachers and students using um the co-pilot tool to code in some ways that is acceptable in other ways they would say that that is not going to be acceptable that too so we have to be very careful about the guidelines that we construct for our students um we really did see industry shift very quickly to AI detection after Chad jpt was officially announced it was kind of a little n industry beforehand with gpt3 was on the market from about 2020 to 2021 and um we have not adopted AI detection here at the University of Mississippi U mainly because is not reliable from our testing in an academic context I know other people have in their actual um colleges universities and through K through 12 I would keep in mind that um these reports that these um that are generated for you use different forms of artificial intelligence to try to catch AI um they are almost always going to have false positives some of them have listed them as low as 1% some of them listed them up there up about 8 to 10% for false positives and also false negatives where they actually Mis um identify AI quite a bit uh we're also seeing that um students uh who are non-native speakers are more often misidentified through AI detection as well so I would just remind faculty too that if you are adopting AI detection to be very mindful that this is not the only report you're going to trust in your judgment of taking that student up on academic misconduct charges um you will see students uh using this technology that is not academically um you know what you would say sound some people are calling it the new form of plagiarism or bot plagiarism the whole idea of when we take a student up on charges is that it's a learning experience for them if they don't understand what's going on with this if they don't understand this too or if there's a blackbox system and by that I mean there's no way to audit any of these reports that come from these systems too you can't ask how it actually came up with its answer as well they're not going to learn anything so when I have a student that's using AI That's outside the guidelines that I create my class to it's a conversation we sit down with each other too we talk with each other to talk about this as well and I emphasize that student too is like look for this assignment too I want to hear your own voice your own thoughts there's other examples too where you can use texture narration or other forms of AI in our class but for this instance you matter to me and what can I do for you to help you understand that to go through that I'm not accusing them of using AI I'm not saying you're going to be brought up on charges I'm saying look you matter I want to hear your voice what can I do to actually make this more effective once we can do this going forward uh Stephen thank you Mark Stephen I'd love to have you share given your position on campus and your department how are you supporting faculty members in these conversations yeah I I think the most important thing is is we have to protect and cultivate trusting relationships between teachers and students and and right now the anxiety that I talked about and a lot of the hype and and the the clickbait um might be interrupting or or damaging some of that trust or getting between students and teachers and so we we all need to resist that um you heard Mark there talk about how how he just has a human- to human conversation and and that's extremely important important that's what we're here to do we're not in law enforcement or anything like that we're we're teachers we need to establish guard rails and um the reason we need to have guard rails is because students who take shortcuts are not learning they're not growing so we we need to keep that all in perspective but as faculty I think it's our our responsibility to to develop AI literacy so that we we can keep up with our students and we have cred ability and then more control and and so that we can establish guard rails that are accurate and reasonable very important what Mark said right now ai detectors are not reliable and we do not want to do any harm to our students um and so as as you all in the audience are having conversations at faculty meetings and um around the coffee pots you know share that news because um some of these detectors are being marketed as as reliable and as a as a solution to a problem um uh also you know I'm I'm I'm concerned about the the the clickbait that our students are seeing on snap and Instagram and some other social media platforms um because you know some some folks are rushing into the marketplace um selling rather aggressively uh the the con cept of dishonesty and and so we need to we need to know that that's happening stay current and and we need to counter those messages in really personal ways with with our students and and talk openly and transparently with them um about how those those those ads that they're seeing are are are wrong and misleading but but our as we do all this and and navigate the new reality I think our default needs to needs to stay um trust you know trust trusting in optim optimism optimism is really important but we have to be informed in informed trust and optimism I love that we building on that optimism and Trust um let's zoom in again on faculty student relationships now that the generative capabilities are widely available in light of academic Integrity um what guidance specifically um I know you're you're saying to lean in on trust but how how to productively fold AI into new writing assignments and Stephen will'll start with you yeah I I do think we all we need to lean in and everybody obviously on on this call is interested um I saw a Triton a new Triton survey in inside HED today um said something like 24 20 less than 25% of higher ed faculty are using um generative AI in in their classes I think we we need to develop AI literacy as quickly as possible amongst faculty and then we we need that number to increase um you know it's a it's sort of a it's a it's an anxious time but it's a fun time and we're all really good Learners in education and so we should play and experiment and go through institutes uh and and professional development events like like the kind that we've we've had here um I think those often need to be local um and and and they need to be in person um you know online learning is great we're doing some introductory online discussion today but um with a topic this big I've seen some magic happen uh in in face-to-face situation so I I think that's pretty important um faculty need to be with other faculty as they're they're talking about these very complicated issues um and then we we we need to to think creatively guy guys's example is is a good one a lot of our teachers here are doing some some cool things and and Mark's got tons of examples that that he's collected um but the bottom line is we need to empower our students you know we want them experimenting and exploring too um they they need to develop new skills for with these new tools and it it is our our responsibility you know we we didn't ask for this change but but it's here and and we want our students to head out into the world as ethical and effective users of generative AI um we want them we want them to be ready for you know 2024 not [Music] 2020 Mark do you have some examples yeah we have this framework if you guys want to voice over this and oh I love I love this framework it it's something Mark and and Dr Russell developed and it's pretty handy yeah we developed this too it is something that is a u definitely an evolving document uh I will say that the one challenge we're seeing too with training faculty and AI literacy is that the um field is not settled there are new uh developments almost every week every month from generative AI just a few weeks ago we had open AI announcing Sora their text a video model too we had Google announcing Gemini um so really finding some stability to use with students is um going to be very important too and also just keeping faculty up to date we did develop this framework when we were piloting these tools about four months before chat GPT was publicly released uh we started in August of uh 2022 and we really wanted to just give our students some guidelines about what this technology was doing this was back in the good old days of gpt3 before even Chad GPT came out so um we didn't even really know text generation would do to student writing because there's nothing out there and we had this idea when I sat down with Dr Chad Russell who uh sits on our academic um AI task force here uh within the department and we came up just with some guidelines to show our students too and again these are evolving they're not perfect by any means uh but it does give your students an idea of what is acceptable what's not uh we can also point to the um joint uh 4C MLA task force on AI and writing that are coming out with um some guidelines of themselves the biggest thing we want is that student who use AI should be open about it we want them to attribute what comes from AI uh and we want to show what is acceptable with AI assistance versus what's not acceptable with just text generation so we think it's fine to explore and brainstorm with different ideas you can get different counterarguments to your own idea too we don't want that to be completely offloaded we want you to be able to balance that with your own counter arguments you come up with though too and call upon AI if you need need assistance to see what other opinions might be from your own own sits we also want you to be able to easily attribute what was uh made through the AI system whether it's a chat based system like chat gbt uh there's lots of other interfaces out there too many of them do not have that future built into it too so finding an interface that has that can be very helpful but we also want to make it very clear that we don't want people to uncritically adopt AI generated content in any way shap or form or doing that as a practice we don't want them to fully offload the process of their learning or writing uh and we want to make sure that this is uh basically all uh understood to our class and our students I talk about this with my students um every semester too this isn't just something I put in the syllabus this is something we bring up and we discuss and we also get into um the habit of co-creating different types of policy I think it's very important to ask your students what um sort of parameters do you want me to use with AI do you want me to use AI when I'm leaving you feedback for your work what is going to be okay with you they will perk up and talk with you in that situation once they realize that faculty also have access to these tools and they will want to have a say in how they are both graded and evaluated using AI or not using a so I would absolutely involve your students in this conversation too and realize that this is going to be um a situation that is going to continue to change uh this is the third or fourth draft I've had of this uh document that since we started doing this in August of 2022 is not going to be the end of it yeah well we uh love this framework and it's um I'm really proud that how grammarly thinks about um this framework aligns very nicely with the our product features things like feedback prompts coaching students to consider counterarguments and help brainstorm for for better um uh for better content also um one of the things we launched last fall was oneclick uh generative AI citations from both gramar generative AI or chat GPT again this whole notion of use it but be responsible with it and make sure you are honest in your um you know assessment and your uh you know calling it out when you've used it so I I love that your framework and how you guys are thinking about that aligns with us it means that we're on the right path so just to get more specific for our audience I I would love to to to talk a little bit more about what you guys see as being um the communication that is going to be best performed continually by human beings well into the future versus what type of content you think is going to be best outsourced to AI technology and Mark let's start with you well I think that's been on my mind quite a bit lately too because we're not just seeing this in terms of text generation anymore too some of the newest features that are coming out from multimodal AI are kind of even shocking to me you can make music you can make um video now with Sor which I just mentioned there's even an app called haen where you can record a two-minute version of yourself and the AI will capture your mannerisms your voice your image too and that's something that I don't think we're really prepared for uh text generation we can handle it's going to be annoying or something else but those types of news systems are out there too I think we would be very careful what we actually offload to generative systems too and what this means for our labor and what this means to expose this um I'm all for using generative tools that exist now in the assistive mode okay uh when we talk about assistance we mean that this is not going to replace a key core factor of your learning um some of the tools and some of the different use cases we looked at with generative AI at first was very much so um along that path one of the tools I tested too was a reading assistant and now adobe's going to come out with one that's going to be Native Native to their actual system too where will automatically summarize things for you well that could really help students with disabilities it could help students who are non-native speakers that actually can do this as well but it could also deskill close reading skills so that's where we have to take a pedological pause and basically say look guys when I'm talking about reading something and actually doing this or writing it it has meaning for you beyond just the actual sort of assignment that we're doing right now in our class it's about your learning and what that means to you going forward to and the skill has the value we don't want to go ahead and just completely offload that to an AI the challenge with that is just being aware of what all the new tools are and how students are being marketed in this to so you can very quickly demystify this for them um there are some new versions of GPT Vision that are coming out now too some people are paying for apps that will allow them to take pictures of their assignments and answer math questions well a these language models are terrible at answering math questions so you probably don't want to be adopting that as part of your prce practice for your homework but students don't actually understand that they don't know that and often times The Faculty don't even know that these tools exist so they can't really uh hop in and do that that's why more than anything else we've been pushing um this uh idea of training faculty and AI literacy and doing this as a continual sustainable process uh that's going to last probably years going forward too so that we're all um completely up to dat about what the tools are capable of and we can all make decisions that are informed about what we want to adopt with these tools and what we don't want to adopt and so we can actually advocate for that for our students I I will guarantee you your students want to know what your take on generative AI is they want to know can I use this is this something that's going to be helpful for me in this class do you think I'm going to need to know these skills going forward when I have a job they're going to want to know that from their teacher they're not going to want to know that from Tik Tok or from Twitter or from snap or whatever else they go to so that is a powerful position to have right now out and that is not going to last forever uh because they will eventually do that it's it's such an important Point novelty works really well in the classroom and and for a year or two um we have the novelty of these tools and students perk up just as Mark said um also last fall or the fall before I can't I'm losing track of time but um one thing we noticed that was was cont contrary to to the the hypee and some of the news stories we we found a lot of students were reluctant to surrender their authorial voices to generative AI tools and and and that's I think just a human hesit hesitancy that is is a Nuance that we need to think about and and explore um this the scholarship of teaching and learning is I mean it's a Gold Rush right now there's so many things about teaching and learning that we need to think about again and um in the context of of these generative AI tools and um and and we all need to do that from our own disciplinary perspectives and um but but yes we I don't I don't think we we should offload the struggle of writing um you know we we only get smarter when when we when we read we write we revise we reflect so um that very profound part of the process can't can't be in well shouldn't be offloaded there will there will be things that we we can offload um you know make citation of sources and at times I think AI will enable us to to be more accurate and and ethical and and that's great um I I think in in some of the um Silicon Valley events when when new tools are um introduced I've noticed a lot of the times the presenter will have the um H have have the tool write a poem and and it sort of bothers me because I love poetry I think a poetry is kind of the highest uh highest form of of writing I'm not a poet myself but um and and it's just it's interesting but not very interesting I think um look looking ahead uh you know it it's it's it's not the question of can a can a large language model imitate Nikki Giovani it's really not all that interesting of a question um but in the future I I wonder what a a future Nikki Giovani might do with the assistance of some of these tools that could be pretty cool there we might be on the precipice of a of a a new um area of creativity that we can't quite imagine yet we both mentioned something we've spent a lot of time talking about leaning into creativity leaning into trust leaning into optimism sort of um working closely with your students to be um transparent around policy and the fact that things are shifting and you both mentioned something in this previous in this recent discussion around what are we what are we doing what how are we preparing students right what is the ultimate goal right now which is being able to create um experiences that lend themselves well to students being prepared for this ever evolving new world of work um you know we've we AG grammarly love this topic we spend a lot of time thinking about it and we've worked with both the Forester and Harrer pulse around understanding what the future is looking like and when I say the future I mean by next year 97% of the company surveyed plan to have a specific generative AI sort of uh implementation around communication tools and efficiency tools so you know this the world that they're entering into is drastically changing um 88% report of workers uh report spending the week just communicating right and being able so to be able to do this efficiently and effectively at scale is sort of the new currency of being highly employable and then 19 hours a week are being dedicated to to communicating and so this all this is all building into irrespective of discipline uh in an undergraduate course of study everyone is going to need to know how to communicate effectively and clearly and they're going to be doing it because they're with with generative AI tools employer employers are saying we want these tools to help us um maximize efficiency so it's it's a really interesting time to both be preparing um the on the foundation and and and looking at this technology in real time as it is evolving I commend you both for leaning into this experience and sharing some of your your your big takeaways um you know grammarly offers a unique position of this we work with a third of the Fortune 500 we believe that our communication tool is impactful uh we want to give all students access to this AI to harness uh not only their knowledge and experience and expertise in their undergraduate world but to better prepare them for their future um we believe that when all faculty and staff and students can write efficiently and effectively everybody in the institution um wins and we are keen on being the most responsible generative AI um tool in the market uh innovating without compromising student learning and being dedicated to working closely with institutions around academic Integrity so um all while being the most uh secure private and trusted Enterprise grade experience so if you want to learn more about how grammarly is coming into these conversations with institutions all over the world um feel free to uh to reach out to us there's a a poll here and someone from our team will connect with you and share more about how we do what we do but I want to leave the last few minutes here uh for some Q&A we had tons of questions submitted I'm going to introduce my colleague Cliff to come and sort of uh take us through some of the the higher higher themed questions that were submitted throughout uh the webinar today and and prior to this today's event yeah hi everybody um Stephen mark thank you and and folks who are wondering I know we were going to 12:45 we can stay on um for a few minutes um if you're willing to to hang with us so um a lot of questions around how writing and writing with AI can actually help students who have disabilities Christine asked for students who have a learning disability in writing itself how do you think AI can help them produce their own ideas without having to worry about generating the written piece on their own and I think um you both touched on some experiments that your peers were running around that that may be helpful there but curious to get your thoughts yeah um I think there is great potential for this to actually help students especially those who have disabilities um the unfortunate thing with edtech is that generally speaking the students with disabilities are the last people served after we get out of the experimental feature with the tools and the one thing that we're seeing with both um open Ai and Google and even Microsoft is um the AI features are still labeled as experimental and so there aren't necessarily geared toward helping students with recognized disabilities at this time uh that doesn't mean you're not going to be seeing um people developing their own versions of this uh the tool I used before was called explain paper that helps students read and you get actually toggle your own reading level too from a high school level to a grade school level too based on the document you upload to it uh and that was just made by two developers who are non-native one was a non-native speaker too who was a computer data scientist and he was trying to do uh as much as he could to go through for his Graduate Studies and feeling overwhelmed by the amount of reading and trying to actually do something that would actually help him so we will see some tools like that that come up before it will take a little bit of time before we can see that uh actually make its way into uh big apps um but I will say that the future I hope is bright in that to actually help people um and it's just going to take a little bit more time uh to do so with gener value tools yeah um a broad question that I think is um a great one that we got in the chat box is um how do you ensure that human creativity continues in the midst of this AI era and how do we bridge the gap for future Generations who may not have that foundational knowledge that we have to move beyond what AI may do for us in the future I I'll try that one um you know as teachers we we we know how to scaffold assignments and how how to think about like dosage for lack of a better term um and to teach students over time whether that's the the the years of K12 or or say a course sequence in higher ed and so we we need to think about um when when to give them the green light to use these tools and when not to and and so in doing that we'll we'll make sure that they're building skills that they need to then interact with these tools effectively and ethically and we also give them time and space to be creative just um alone you know with with with in their own minds and that's re a really important part of being human and it it's it's it's something to worry about especially um when we see the levels of engagement on the phones that that our students are um are are currently um in I mean it's it's it's just watch you know watch your your teenager your your child on the phone and they're they're excellent at absorbing attention and demanding engagement so as teachers I think we've got to find creative ways to move them occasionally away from the tech and then back to the tech and then maybe back back away again be because we we ultimately we want technology to empower and enhance creativity not compromise it you're here I agree with that and I would also say that um one of the biggest growing um Majors across colleges is creative writing and then vast majority of those students are not eager to uh seed their creativity to an algorithm uh this is not uh we will see these tools being used by creative writers uh specifically for probably for research if you're writing on a TV show or if you're George RR Martin and you have a million characters I I don't even think he's finished his series yet even though the TV show is over with but there are some features you can use to actually search through massive amounts of text and actually begin to think about different plots but that's again like a brainstorming thing too it's not about just natively coming up with creativity on your own that will remain you know you we we've we've had some of these discussions here and and one thing I'm wondering about is is audience we talk a lot about audience when we're teaching writing and I don't know I'm not sure yeah like chat GPT is churning out um billions and billions of words I think Sam Alman had a tweet about that the other day um but what about the audience you know are are we as humans going to be eager to read texts that we know has been generated purely by AI or will human authorship still matter to us I I I think human authorship really matters to me um and but that's to be determined yeah I think there some there was actually a question in the chat around like music implications with AI too and I think that's a similar um thread that you're touching on Stephen a related topic particularly for this conversation is a question that we got in the chat around what are some things in writing pedagogy that have been problematic for a long time so not traditionally done particularly well that can now be tackled with AI shaking up the field well multimodality multimodalities still you know it's it's it's a great thing to do to have your students um take writing and and move it to video or take writing and move it to audio and and and using photography and those kind of mixtures we we pursue those here um it's a way to force reflection and and to really extend learning um but there are always like technological challenges to that and I I think I think these tools are really going to help um facilitate multimodality what do you think Mark I think they will too um I think it's a big question talking about um actually embracing certain aspects of the tools to enhance creativity in different ways for different audiences and different purposes uh when we do when I first started teaching here over a decade ago a multimodal project and a writing course was a PowerPoint presentation I think we're so far beyond this now what you can do with the technology that we have with uh non-ai systems and now with these new generative tools too that um sort of the limit is with your own creativity and asking students to embrace that creativity and sort of explore these different types of tools and use cases is going to be uh an important part of building their own literacy um the one thing that we've noticed repeatedly with students and with faculty too is that most of them use the free version of Chad GPT or a free version of another tool they don't really go beyond that version of it to to see about the capabilities of it and that is going to be something that we're going to to consider uh going forward in education and also in Workforce too to see about if we need to be providing um different stakeholders access the most up-to-date tools and if there is a difference to the quality of what these those produce versus um you know the free versions of this eventually I'm I'm guessing gp4 which is now open ai's top thee line model to will be the free version once GPT 5 or seven is on the market if that's Remains the Same uh but for right now we are in this sort sort of weird space where we're seeing a lot of people play around with some free versions of the tools uh but seeing a lot of very different capabilities behind pay walls and that brings up to mind equity and access and a lot of other questions yeah um Jenny I know you have thoughts on that too but just as as we close out I want to end on a question we got related to gram related for Education specifically um and that is in what ways does gramly for Education aim to Foster human AI collaboration in the realm of academic writing AI collaboration in the realm of sorry you cut out human AI collaboration in the realm of academic writing oh um well one thing that I think is really um exciting and and we're continuing to um to double down our efforts is all of our our our mix of AI is is both artificial intelligent machine learning and then we have actual human beings data scientist teams with multiple phds um who work with us to make sure all of our recommendations are um you know don't have implicit bias and and really we have another uh set of lit quite literal eyes and ears on the recommendations that we that we uh push out for students and the other thing too I want to I want to make sure is is clear is you know generative AI we're still in this sort of gray area where we've got some institutions Jumping All In excited let's go you know uh figure out how we want to um revamp our pedagogy and our assignments other schools are a little more trepidation trepidacious and then there's many that are kind of in the middle and with with our generative tools you are able to um toggle them on and off based off of which you know users and groups you want to give access to the tool if there are certain courses you want students to be able to show Proficiency in before they have access to the generative engine maybe that's something to consider uh you have that flexibility with with grammarly so we're constantly thinking about ways to um keep uh some you know actual human controls on this in a way that uh aligns nicely with the goals of each uh individual institution so yeah um I think we can cap it there if you want to close us out Mark thanks so much particularly in Q&A like I think there's wonderful questions from folks so um appreciate the engagement everybody we will do our best to follow up with questions if we didn't get to your question um also take a look uh in in your inbox in a couple weeks we're sending a future of writing ebook to everyone who's registered for this event so keep an eye out for that we will continue to have conversations around the ever evolving topic that is the future of writing in in the generative AI era and if you want to learn more you can go to grammarly.com to hear more about what the education side of grammarly has to say about all of this so thank you so much thanks again to Mark and Stephen and thank you all for joining today take care,unknown
r3J8UAg3KEY,oh I've always wanted to do this it's really difficult to be an education in 2024 specifically in higher education and the giant elephant in the room which is the emergence of generative AI into this space a highly disruptive technology and what that can and should do for the learning experience good to see you today thanks for coming glad to be here how important student writing is to any institution right now is Sky High we know at the student level that teaching a student how to do something requires that they access tools grammarly really wants to insert ourselves where possible into these conversations to help institutions bridge the gap from where they are to where they can be my institution decided to adopt grammarly for Education because we noticed that there were some deficits in student writing grammar facilitates in making sure that what the writer intends to convey is accurately conveyed in the papers this is such an exciting time for me because now now what I can focus on when the commas have been taken care of when the awkward wording has been fixed for my students I can focus on really why I wanted to do this job once they install grammarly it works across different platforms without having to toggle back and forth between different programs I know my students some pull it up for grammarly in the browsers and other like to go onto the web app with the dawn of AI and gener of text right now it's really changing the way that people work it's changing the way that our students experience the curriculum it's rethinking hundreds of years if not more of how we've been doing what we've been doing our students are able to use safe and responsible promps as well as being able to site when and how they use generative AI in their content creation our Partnerships within institutions allow institutions to turn these features on and off as they see fit AI is going to be everywhere and everything and if we don't give students access to those experiences while they're on our campus they're not going to be prepared for their Futures there's so much that students can be able to acheve aieve when they're able to have that just in time feedback everybody wants positive professional communication and grammarly helps us achieve that what new stuff are we going to see that we haven't imagined before that these tools are going to allow our students to do our students aren't just using these new tools they're the ones who are going to develop the next iteration of these tools too we've been a dedicated educational tool for over 15 years we've helped millions and millions of students not only through their collegiate experiences but soon thereafter as they landed into their professional Journeys the future is bright the Outlook is good thinking through what else is going to come next man that's just exciting stuff,unknown
