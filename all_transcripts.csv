7DKv5H5Frt0,"This isn’t the standard
YouTuber burnout-apology video. And it’s not “oh, woe is me,
I’m leaving forever”. I’m going somewhere with this. Literally. I’ve been throwing stuff
at the internet since 1999. And for many, many years,
that stuff went almost nowhere. I had occasional bits of success, but could never make
any of them last long-term. I remember thinking, so many times
during all those years… will any of this
stuff I’m making ever work? Well, this did. I didn’t know that,
back when I was filming the first videos for the series
that was then called Things You Might Not Know, I just held out my phone
at arm’s length and talked into it for 90 seconds
with almost no research! I really don’t like
those videos now. But the first of them
was published exactly ten years
before this one. To the minute.
4pm, January 1st, 2014. For the first month
of that format, I was publishing a video
almost every day, and then I settled down:
one video a week. Mostly on location,
near windswept infrastructure, although there’s computer science
and linguistics in there too, and occasional green-screen
animated videos. I experimented with
other formats on other days, but the rule
I set myself was: Monday, 4pm,
something interesting. I never got to space. I never got to
the ocean depths. And I never got to fly harnessed
underneath a helicopter, I couldn’t find an excuse
to do that one. But I never missed a week. There’s been a few guest videos,
of course, and occasionally some
blatant filler. One time I just uploaded
two and a half hours of unedited footage of garlic bread
flying to the edge of space, and that turned into one of the
most viewed videos I’ve ever had. Sometimes a video would be
a day or two early or late for one reason or another.
But to my own satisfaction, which is ultimately the
only thing that I’m counting, there’s been a video a week
for ten years. I never broke the streak. I don’t know when I decided
to try for ten years. It felt like a
good, round number to reach. As the YouTube game
changed over the years, as the channel became bigger, as my own standards
became higher and higher to keep pace with all the people I was collaborating with
and competing with, as this became my life– I decided that my goal
was ten years. And that is today,
as this is published. 4pm, January 1st, 2024. So now it’s time
to take a breather. I can’t keep this up. This is my dream job, and
I have a lot of fun doing it. I know I’m incredibly lucky. But a dream job is still a job. And it’s a job that keeps getting
bigger and more complicated and I am so tired! There’s nothing in my life
right now except work. I did get close to burning out, but fortunately I always knew
when to step back from the brink. And it’s not like I can
drop the quality back down? That’s not how YouTube
works these days. Over the last year or so,
I have talked to some folks who are more successful than me, who were in this position
a few years back. And it’s clear that I now
have two possible choices. I could keep making
bigger and better things, keep climbing the ladder, build a business,
hire full-time employees… and end up as a manager. And that would be great for
someone who isn’t me, but I know I’m bad at that, and I’d hate every second of it. So, option 2…
I could not do that, I could do less,
and be happier. So I’m taking a break
for… some time. I don’t know when or
if I come back, but when I do,
it won’t be weekly. At least, not in this format,
not here. This probably isn’t
goodbye-goodbye? Like, not forever? The podcast I host, Lateral,
is still going out weekly, my newsletter’s still going out, the Plus channel will probably
return at some point, there’ll likely be new
Technical Difficulties episodes, there are links to all those things
around here somewhere. And there will probably be
all-new projects here or somewhere else, projects that are experimental
and weird and can fail. Because I miss doing
stuff like that. And when some fool comes along
and goes “oh, you fell off, “this new stuff isn’t getting
the views is it?”… Yeah. Okay. That’s fine. This project has worked,
and it’s time to move on. I’m still going to be looking for
interesting things to film here, there’ll probably still be videos
here from time to time, I really do love doing this.
There is a part of my brain that desperately, desperately
does not want this to end. So if you’ve got an idea
for a future video, you can still tell me about it. And one day, I might make it. But right now, I need to spend time
with people I hold dear, I need there to be things in my life
that are not work, and it’s been years
since that’s been true. I never celebrated
the milestones. Subscriber numbers
weren’t ever my goal. So I never did any big
so-many-subscribers thank you videos. But, still… thank you. To you watching, and to everyone
who’s helped along the way. I did think that
I should end this with a big, syrupy, sentimental,
self-indulgent montage and head off into the sunset… …and you know what? Just this once, for the first time
in ten years… that’s exactly what
I’m going to do."
F0JDK_71yDg,"The technical term
for these things is 'transmission towers'. But here in Britain,
we call them pylons. And we've got tens of thousands
of them across the country. The first National Grid was
built in the interwar years, and it was the largest
peacetime construction project Britain had ever seen. A single power network
across the country. Pylons became part of
the landscape of Britain, just as they had
around the world, despite the objections of many landowners,
traditionalists, and poets. These exist because
overhead lines are a fraction of the price
of underground cables, and they're much, much easier
and faster to maintain. If there's a fault,
you don't need to bring in heavy equipment and
dig anything up. Instead, you dispatch
a team to climb. And that team will have
learned the job here, at the National Grid
Training Centre near Eakring in
the East Midlands. And today,
one of those teams is going to take me
up on the wires. So here at
the Training Centre, we have over 300
graduates and apprentices training in overhead lines
and substation technologies. The team that
have trained here will undertake a range of roles. They might be overhead
line operators, so they'll be climbing towers,
responding to faults. They also conduct
visual inspections. We have a team of drone
and helicopter pilots that keep the
network operating. And then we have
substation teams as well. So they would look at
cleaning and replacing different equipment
within our substations. I haven't looked
at any point out or down to see
how high I am. I'm just kind of going,
there's the next bolt, there's the next bolt. And I'm aware that
the professionals ...are doing this
much faster than me. And I'm fine with that. We have a team
of 2,400 people that monitor and operate, maintain the network
around the clock, 24/7. This might be in response to weather or
faults on the network. And they keep
the energy flowing. Presumably, you're
up here in all weathers. You'll have dealt with
rain and snow. In an emergency,
they definitely work in bad weather. Can you just take
one more step up? Yep. We'll attach you
onto the actual tower. Give you
a bit more space. Thank you. Oh, it's not a bad view
either, is it? Yeah, it's
not bad around here. So what, this is first arm. Yep, bottom phase,
middle phase, top phase. Huh, it's different phase
of power on each arm? Yep.
Right! That makes sense. Because otherwise
the three would kind of interact with
each other on the wires. So we have 22,000 pylons. Each pylon weighs
approximately 30 tons. 4,500 miles of overhead line, and 900 miles of
underground cable. Because we're
at our training school, we've got all different
combinations of wires in
different formations. We've got our new towers there. Yeah, the T-pylons.
T-pylons, yep. Which aren't as high. No, they're a bit lower. I'll keep climbing. Oh, it's getting real windy now! You're doing good, Tom. If you're wondering... this is the point where
the nerves kicked in. I don't know if
that's coming across on microphone and camera, but... the wind is whistling through the metal and
through the wires. Okay.
Well done, Tom. (laughs) Thank you. There's plenty of people
who don't get up here. Mind the head. Oh, how's that?
(laughs) We own and
operate the network in England and Wales. We also operate
parts of Scotland. This training centre was built
in the heart of the country because a lot of the power
stations were around here, in the Midlands and Yorkshire. Because a lot of the coal
that fuelled those power stations was being dug up
around here. Not all of it – there was
plenty in Scotland and Tyneside and
South Wales too. And a cluster of power
stations down on the Thames. But if you were
going to pick a spot in the centre
of the power grid to have the best access
of every pylon ...you'd pick here. But things are changing, and have been
changing, for decades. The only coal-fired
station left in Britain is about an hour south on the other side
of Nottingham, and that'll close down
within a year. The main replacement
right now is gas, and those stations tend
to be on the coast, where enormous tankers of
liquid natural gas can dock. The nuclear plants
are by the coast too, for easy access
to cooling water. And then there's the wind. Britain is a windswept island! And we already
get a quarter of all our power
from the wind, with half of that from
colossal fields of turbines offshore. And there are more, and more,
and more of those being built. Britain's entire power grid has been steadily turning
inside out for years. As anyone who lives in a
former coal mining community like this knows all too well, power generation just isn't
happening here anymore. Electricity isn't being
pushed out from the centre. Instead, it's being
brought in from the coast. Alright, next stop... Down on the wires. I've got to be honest with you, that ladder is swaying
a lot more than I'd like. Aye, I'm going to
go down first, and I'll get it a lot
more stable for you. (laughs) Thank you! National Grid's role is to move energy
around the country. We don't generate energy. We just connect it
to our network. It's weird to see
all this infrastructure and not hear the bu— I mean, I guess
if you hear the buzzing and you're on here,
you're really in trouble. In total today,
we have 65 gigawatts of generation connected
to the network. That's a whole range of sources. So we have about
90 sources of generation. And the government has
a target to connect an additional 50 gigawatts
of offshore wind by 2030. Oh!
Step down. Okay. Like it's
any normal ladder. A lot of metres
above the ground. That's fine. The ladder is angled
the wrong way. My arms are further
back than my legs. In order to
connect the 50 gigawatts of offshore wind that
we're seeing out at sea, we need to create a
series of subsea cables, new overhead lines, in order to move that
energy across the network. As it stands, we know
that we need to construct five times as much
infrastructure in the next seven years
as we have in the last 30. So if you just
stop there for two seconds... Yep.
You can stand on this. And it's pretty secure. That was fun, okay. (clattering)
(groans) Okay, one foot on each wire. Wherever you feel comfortable, you're perfectly fine.
Alright. Wow! It's all
pretty sturdy stuff. You didn't have to prove
that by bouncing though! (both laughing) It's impossible to disentangle
politics from the power grid. When the National Grid
was first built, the government had to ignore so many complaints
to push it through. But the benefits were obvious. And even the folks
who rallied against pylons would have to admit
that the result was probably worth it
compared to no electricity. But now, and over
the next few years, there are going to
be political fights and protests, large and small. Because for the first time
in nearly a century, there are some big
and tough decisions to be made about pylons. [Caption+ by JS*

pU9sHwNKc2c,"This video has been dubbed and subtitled
into several languages. On most devices, you can
call up YouTube’s settings, and switch between them.
And if you do, you’ll find that outside the
original language, English, the words in the subtitles and
dubbing often don’t match. Which happens a lot,
mostly in professional TV shows, and it can be frustrating
for those of us who like to listen
but also use subtitles. The short reason why is: subtitles and dubbing are usually done
by different teams of people. But to answer why that happens, I need to take you on a journey
that’s going to involve geese, a roller coaster,
and this advert. This video is sponsored by NordVPN. That’s not a joke, this video is
actually sponsored by NordVPN, who have been very useful as
I’ve been travelling around! Visit nordvpn.com/tomscott to find the
best deal they’re offering right now. Now, in most of the languages
that advert was translated into, the subtitles and dubbing
pretty much match. In French, Spanish and Portuguese, the word order is roughly
the same as in English, and it’s a simple translation. But in the most obvious
Hindi translation, the company name sits in the
middle of the sentence, and standard practice for
modern professional dubbing is to match lip movements
as closely as possible. Now, there is a way to rephrase
the sentence in Hindi so that the company name
sits at the end. The dubbing team chose that option, and the lip movements
pretty much match. But the subtitling team didn’t
see any reason to do that, and so the lines are different. In Japanese, which has
the same problem, the dubbing team instead
found a translation where the lip movements
look close enough. But why don’t they just
take the dubbing script, and then turn it
into subtitles? Why translate everything twice? Well, subtitles have their
own limitations. I gave the translation teams
for this video some deliberately
difficult examples. A few years ago, I made a video
on YouTube’s copyright systems, and it included this sidebar
about a song that I don’t like: Maroon 5’s Memories is an
infuriating composition that uses the start of the melody
of Canon in D but never resolves it, which means it has the same
stuck-in-your-head effect as the jingle from Alfred Bester’s
The Demolished Man, and I hate it. The modern approach to subtitling
in most languages is that reading is
faster than talking, and that even for
fast talking like that, you put every word on screen.
The viewer can always pause. But that wasn’t always the case. If you watch anything in English that was
subtitled more than 10 or 15 years ago, like reruns on television
or movies on DVD, you’ll find the subtitles
often summarise what’s said. Style guides used to emphasise the skill in
“careful and sensitive subtitle editing”, because they thought it was important
that everyone got the meaning, even if they were a slow reader, because you couldn’t easily
pause and go back. And besides, why would someone who can hear
watch video with subtitles? It’s not like we’d all end up with
tiny televisions in our pocket, or sound mixing changes would mean dialogue was going to be
suddenly difficult to hear. In the original English version of
that Maroon 5 rant that I just did, I made a reference to
The Demolished Man by Alfred Bester, which isn’t that well-known
even in English. So for Japanese viewers, who have
probably never heard of it, the local subtitle translator decided
to remove the reference entirely and get the same meaning
across in fewer characters. Opinions can differ, but I think
that’s a pretty solid decision. If they’d just taken the breathless,
high speed performance of the Japanese voice actor, then it would have been a
worse experience for subtitle readers. And well done to the voice actor,
by the way! That cannot have been easy. And this is just to translate
one person performing a script! Imagine if it was a reality show, with six people shouting and
talking quickly and stumbling their words
and interrupting each other. The subtitles would
have to summarise, while the voice actors for the dub
can shout over each other. But it does mean that in this case, for some Japanese viewers,
that reference is lost. That’s one of the other
big challenges with translation. How much do you translate the words
versus translating the meaning? Here’s another really difficult example. “Anyone want to buy some goslings?” “They’re going cheep.” The English version of that joke
is pretty much impossible to translate! It relies not just on a pun, but
on knowledge of colloquial English. You have to know that “going”
can mean “making a noise”. You have to know that “cheep”
is the English word for the noise that baby birds make,
cheep-cheep-cheep, and you have to know that
“going cheap”, spelled differently, is slang for “on sale
at a good price”. I loved seeing the responses from
the translators on this example. A couple of folks translated it
word for word, and just gave up on the joke.
Fair enough. But I do want to highlight
a couple of them. The Portuguese subtitle and dubbing teams
came up with the same joke! And so did the Spanish subtitler. ‘Ganso’ in both languages means ‘goose’,
and ‘cansado’ means ‘tired’, so they combined them
into the word ‘gansado’, and now I’m asking if anyone
wants the goslings because I’m goose-slash-tired of them?
Brilliant. And both the French and Spanish
dubbing teams came up with their own puns based on their languages’
words for bird noises, because yes, the sounds that animals
are said to make differ in each language! And I love this! This is translating meaning and intent,
not just words. In case you’re wondering, I did try several AI translation tools,
as well as just asking a large language model
to translate this stuff, and as of right now,
as of 2023, capturing that nuance,
that meaning, that performance, definitely still requires humans. At least for the goose clip, the translators didn’t have
to match my lips. But they did have to
match the goose’s honk! Because I talked over it, so they had to go to another bit
of the video that you didn’t see, copy and paste the background noise
and a different goose honk from there, and synchronize them up. Someone had to lip-sync a goose. Beak-sync, actually. I— they—
they don’t have lips. …I don’t think they have lips. All of which comes together
for this example. Last year, I made a video where I tried to get over my
phobia of roller coasters. And, spoiler, I did! And just after my terror changed to joy,
on a ride called Nemesis, I shouted this: Yes! Have it! The original English
is “have it”. How on earth do you
translate “have it”? It’s got no literal meaning. And more than that,
it’s kind of obscure slang? Different people in
different parts of Britain might use it for different things, and it’s almost impossible
to Google. In my context, it’s a cry of excitement, triumph, adrenaline,
encouragement, success. It’s the sort of thing that you might
yell after your team scores a goal, or to cheer on your friend
after they’ve successfully downed two pints of
lager back-to-back. It feels very male?
Very “drunken lads’ night out’? I did pass a note with all that
context on to the translators, but for many productions
they won’t be working with notes. They’ll only have the original show,
and maybe the script, if there is one. So, here is that cry in all
the video’s languages. Subtitling teams have their
choice of any word or phrase, but they have to fit
the words on the screen. Dubbing teams can get
their voice actors to emote in the studio
as much as possible… but the lip movements
have to match. That’s why subtitles
and dubbing differ. And if you want a perfect
example of that: …this advert has also been
translated into five languages! And no matter which
one you speak, you can push NordVPN’s
magic Quick Connect button, and your phone and computer
can pretend they’re in any one of
around 60 countries, from Albania to Vietnam. So if you’re travelling and want websites
to stop automatically translating for you, it’s easy! Or if you want to
watch stuff from another country, but it’s blocked where you are,
you can. (Just check the streaming service’s
terms and conditions first.) NordVPN works on Windows, Linux,
Mac, iOS and Android, up to six devices
at the same time, and there’s a 30-day
money-back guarantee. So if you’re not sure:
try it anyway. When I first used it, I thought
I’d only use it occasionally, but over the last year… it really has come in handy for me,
time after time after time. I keep endorsing NordVPN because
it keeps being a thing I actually use. You can go to nordvpn.com/tomscott,

LDiXNsWQzD0,"I'm not allowed to climb this tower. I did ask, but not only does climbing this need proper training and safety equipment, it's also a protected historic site. The folks in charge are
understandably a bit cautious. But while I can't go up there... the camera and you can. This is a moonlight tower
here in Austin, Texas, and it's one of the last surviving
municipal lighting towers anywhere, because if you're lighting up a city
to keep people safe at night, why have thousands of small lamps
down every street when you could have just a few,
very bright and very high? - Each tower was intended to provide light
equal to that of natural moonlight in an area 1500 feet
from the base of the tower, and that is light by which somebody could
read the face of their watch. These lighting systems were
all throughout the Midwest and all throughout the west. - When these towers
were installed in 1894, they used carbon arc lamps,
the first practical electric lights. Those lamps were literally
controlled electrical arcing, a constant spark shooting through the air
between two carbon electrodes. These days, if you're seeing that kind of
harsh white light at this scale,  it's usually because there's a fault
with something big and electrical and there's a short in the system. This was the same effect, just deliberate. The catch is that the
electrodes on carbon arc lamps are steadily vaporized, wearing down
as they're worn away by the spark, so they burn out quickly.
And the city had to pay someone to climb every tower every day
to replace the lamps. - The City of Austin Electric Utility,
and as we know it today, Austin Energy, started with the moonlight towers. Every night, a utility employee
would go up through this elevator pulley system
through the middle of the tower and go light these carbon arc lamps. This pulley system,
there's this little thing for the employee to stand in, and then you have workers on the ground
who are hoisting him up. You're going up potentially
165 feet in the air. I don't know when hard hats
came into play, but when you look at
older pictures, our safety equipment
is not as it is today. So then in the 1920s, they
switched to incandescent bulbs, and in 1936 it was the
mercury vapor lamps, and today we're using LED bulbs, and it's a little bit
easier to get up there and exchange the parts. So we're using cranes and bucket trucks to get up to make those changes. - If ever there was a subject designed for vertical
video, it's this one. Most cities took their towers down as electric street lighting
became possible. For some unknown reason,
Austin never got round to it, but they've not all been preserved. There's only about a dozen
towers still standing. Not all of those are in the
same locations they used to be. And in 1993, the city took them all apart, refurbished them, and
put them back up again. As for what they look like
when they're switched on, well, for that, we'll need
to wait until after sunset. - Austin is the only city
in the United States that still has functioning moon towers. Before the moonlight towers
were put up around town, it was dark!
The moon could only do so much. And so it really changed people's lives. I think it allowed them to keep
businesses open after dark, which would increase commerce. People could enjoy themselves
with friends and family, and also get home safely. Moonlight towers were
the only game in town for light after dark, you know, in parallel with the
moon itself, of course. - And these towers clearly work because, well, look at
me, I've got a shadow, although admittedly I am
standing right next to it. The name moonlight towers
isn't just poetic. 31 of these towers were spread around what was then a much
smaller and lower city before skyscrapers came along. That meant that except
for some dark corners, most of the town would be lit up as if there was a full
or maybe a half moon. Not that bright, but enough that you could
see your way around. Hence moonlight tower.
It's artificial moonlight. Although, turns out
there's not much evidence for that name being used
until the mid-20th century when historical preservation
became fashionable and these towers became an icon of Austin. - They were not called moonlight
towers from the beginning. The Austin newspapers just
called these ""the towers"". There were no other towers. First reference that
I found in a newspaper to these being called moonlight towers, it was 1938. In the early 1960s, the masthead of the Austin newspaper had the phrase, ""As Austin As"". The phrase changed each day, where the newspaper was comparing itself to other icons in the city of Austin. And in July, 1962, the masthead said, ""As Austin as Moonlight Towers"". They have become a symbol of Austin. - And every holiday season, one of those moonlight
towers in Zilker Park gets used to put up hundreds
and hundreds of bulbs of lights that look like a holiday tree. And you go and you spin
around and you look up and you get dizzy, and
you feel like Austin is just the best place to be. - There are modern
versions of these towers for places like giant parking lots. Sometimes it is just better to
stick a big light on a pole. In most cases, though, modern lighting
is a much better choice, because every street got
wired up to the grid anyway. Although that does mean
in the 21st century, it's difficult to imagine what a city lit just by
moonlight towers would feel like. These days there's too
much other light around from every house, every building. On a night with low cloud, the skyglow from light pollution can be brighter than
the old towers would be. At least, brighter than they
would be at a distance. These aren't street lighting anymore. They're historic artifacts,
kept running because, well, because the people of Austin like them."
jplrbxI5GN8,"Do you remember that
container ship, the Ever Given, that got stuck in the
Suez Canal back in 2021? The final report
into what happened came out a few months ago,
as I record this, and there were a lot of
things that went wrong. It was travelling too fast, there were communications
problems between the crew and the local pilots, and there was the
bank effect. There are two ways
to learn what that is. You can get the
theoretical explanation that big ships get
sucked to the sidewalls by pressure differences when travelling
at speed along canals. But if that seems
a bit abstract, you can learn it hands-on. Because this is the Port Iława Ship Handling
Research and Training Centre in the north of Poland. And this is one of the places where the folks who
steer those big ships learn how to do it. Just to be clear, I'm not
getting a full training course. That takes days
and includes a huge amount of theory work
and study as well. I'm just going to drive a
miniature container ship for a lap around
the lake, and... hopefully not get it
stuck in the Suez Canal. We have started our
training activity in 1980. In the '90s, we have moved from
the old lake towards this one, and practically first training
here was realized in 1991, more or less 30 years ago. We are performing
training in ship handling. We have a lot of
different mockups presenting
different waterways. Everything was built using
exactly the same scale, 1:24. Deep waters,
shallow waters, different restrictions,
rivers, canals. And what is more important? Of course, ship models. Permission to come aboard? Granted.
(laughs) Okay. This is bigger than I thought
it was going to be. It's one of the
biggest in the world. 400 metre ship. 400 metre? Scaled down 1:24,
that's still... 16 and a half. That's— Okay,
this is big, cool. We can proceed.
Dead slow ahead. So dead slow ahead?
Yep. And steady as she goes.
Forward. I assume that means just
keep it going straight, okay. These are the
tugboat simulators. Oh, I don't feel
guilty about you... You've taken
the controls here. I'd be on tugboats going out. I was meant to be asking
all sorts of questions here, and I'm just slightly nervous
about driving a tiny boat. It's not a tiny boat. It's a 400m container ship. Yep. So you have
controls there that simulate the effect
of tugs on the boat. Right, four tugs. You may make a
rather hard to port. Hard to port? I don't know why... but I thought I was
going to spin that like the wheel of a
pirate ship, and it's just a...
Yeah. Alright, so
what's our plan now? Okay, so now we can go
through the lock if you like. Yeah, absolutely. Basically we go that direction,
south of the island. I feel like I need
to go left here. Yeah, make it port 10.
Port, not left. We have had, in our history, more than 6,000 pilots,
masters, and chief officers from more than 50 countries. On average, 220–230 a year. We have beginners, but we have also very
experienced masters. Because the lock
is very shallow... Yeah.
We will have only 2cm of water
under the keel. If we have too high a speed,
we touch the bottom. So the faster I go
in shallow water, the more the boat is going to
get sucked down to the ground. More squat
you have, yeah. We have to come
in line with the lock. Oh!
Sooner we do that, more time we have to apply
any correction if necessary. That is such a tight
spot to navigate through. Hard to starboard
for a while. Hard to star—
Starboard, starboard. The minute I feel like
I've got this... It's all going to fall apart. Uh, midships? Yes, please.
Yep. And starboard— yep.
Starboard 20. And midships, yep. Oh, I think I've
overcorrected there! There's some very strong work being done by the
tugboats here, thank you. We have no clearance here! I feel like starboard slightly? Yeah, starboard 20.
Starboard 20. (winces) I can't see how
close we are there. Did we clear that?
Yes. I think we cleared that.
Yes! (wheezes) Again,
solid tugboat work. Midships, surely. Starboard 20.
Okay! The basic training
program takes five days. A linear scale, 1:24, means that timescale is equal
to more or less five. It means everything happens five times faster
than in reality. And feeling for a ship
may be affected. It's a disadvantage. But on the other hand,
five days of training will correspond to 25 days
of training in reality. Hard to starboard.
Hard to starboard. I'm more the helmsman
than the captain at this point, thank you. Hard to port again. Hard to port.
Left hand down a bit! Okay, I think we
can make half ahead. Half ahead. We are clear of the lock. Oh, yeah. Phew! Full ahead.
Full ahead! (both laughing) Did I need to slam that
forward so dramatically? Absolutely not, but... Our first models
were really very simple. Nothing inside. Just wheel,
engine telegraph, and that's it. And step by step... we have started to add
different facilities. We have electronic navigation. It means a very precise
GPS system, which allows to measure a
given ship model trajectory with precision equal to
one, maybe two centimetres. Suddenly the nerves
have gone. Open ocean. Open lake. Starboard 10.
Starboard 10. 'Cause you've
got to cancel out what you've just given it, right?
Yeah. We're still going
quite strongly to port just because that input from...
The wind. Ages ago, and the wind?
Due to the wind, yeah. I'm amazed how much
the wind is affecting this. You have to imagine
that such a ship, fully loaded, has about 20,000
square metres with the windage area. (heavy sigh) Everything during
exercises is measured, sent to our classroom,
and in case of problems, we can discuss step by step, and we can show where
mistakes were made. Ooh! ...I'm sorry, I got
distracted by a cormorant. (both chuckle) Current, especially in
the case of shallow water, is a big problem. It means we have
current generators. This current velocity can be
changed according to our needs. (metal colliding) I thought we hit something. Oh, we did.
That's me, sorry. No problem.
(nervous chuckle) It's not like this thing
has rear-view mirrors. Okay, half ahead. Half ahead? We're sailing a
massive container ship down the Suez Canal. Do I need to put a little
bit of rudder in here? Yeah, it's fine. Now you
have to go behind Varta. Right.
You can make a port 10. Port 10, got it. I think we're clear
of the red buoy. Midship.
Midships. (winces)
No, no, it's clear. Okay. Port 20.
Port 20. Midships.
Midships. Okay. And a full ahead. Full ahead, okay! Starboard 20.
Starboard 20. Because we've got to
ease out the turn. Then you will start
feeling the bank effect from the starboard wall. Okay. Hard to starboard. So it feels like
I could go midships now. We should just go straight
down the middle of this canal. Except... The bank effect,
you see, bow is coming out. It means the repulsion
force pushes the bow. Now you have to make
a hard to starboard. Hard to starboard.
Gah, yeah! I'm being sucked
towards the port wall! I'm putting full
right lock on here. Midships.
Midships, okay. You see, again, it's coming. Yep... it is! So we have to make
hard to starboard. Hard to starboard, yeah,
if I don't do hard to starboard— You would have hit this wall.
Yeah. I'm absolutely gonna
ram that if we're not careful. Yeah. That's so powerful!
Midships. Yep. Yeah, hard to starboard.
Hard to starboard. I was midships. We should have been
going straight ahead. And I think...
I think... I have to help you
with that task. Yeah, you're going
to have to help with that. I should've done that earlier. Everybody down. Clear.
Oh, cleared?! Midship. Hard to port now.
(bewildered laugh) Hard to port. You were lucky,
one inch clear. That was more luck than
good judgment, that was! Our research is focused
on ship handling. It means interaction
forces, and... autonomous ships. We have started realisation of
research programs three or four years ago,
because... autonomous ships
will be really very popular. We need at least
ten ships' lengths... Yeah.
...to stop the ship. Ten ships' lengths? And that harbour is here. Oh, I definitely need
to put some port in. Yes. Hard to port.
Port 20. Hard to port, okay. Everything in case
of our training centre is realised in real conditions. You can feel very well
wind, you can feel very well
current, and everything what deals
with weather conditions. Such a situation
does not happen in case when using
computer simulators. And... especially
pilots coming to our training centre for training
prefer very often to use models instead of
computer simulation. Every driver's
instinct in me is going, ""I can just slam it in reverse.
Take it 'round, it'll be fine."" No, it won't.
That's not how this works. Collisions really occur
at our training centre. The main difference regarding
computers and our models is in computers,
in case of problems, you can switch off everything, and you can restart
everything. That's okay. In the case of our
training centre, the only one thing
to do is to... call technical staff
for rescue tugs. And quite often,
our models are sent directly from the training
centre to our ""shipyard"" for different repairing works. And this psychological
effect influences very much the
level of education. People realise everything
a little bit differently when comparing with
computer simulators. Alright, we are home.
(sighs) That was a privilege.
Thank you very, very much. I know very few
people get to do that. You're welcome, no problem.
So thank you so much. Here, every
instructor can do that (laughs)
...very easily. [Caption+ by JS*

CmZdGo6b5yA,"In George Orwell's 1984, the government is trying
to force Britain, or rather, ""Airstrip One"",
to use Newspeak: a constructed language that
would end ""thought-crime"". The goal, so the story goes,
is to make it impossible to form ideas that could
challenge the ruling Party by taking away the words
to think them with. Linguists often cringe when
they hear people talk about the idea that the language you speak
determines how you can think. Because it's… well, it's
not really a thing. It's been called the
""Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis"", because it's associated with
Benjamin Lee Whorf, an early 20th century linguist,
and his mentor, Edward Sapir. They weren't the first, the last,
or the loudest linguists to ask the question, and they never
wrote anything even close to a hypothesis about it together. They wondered how language
could impact thought, and vice versa,
but no more than that. The concept is known as linguistic determinism
in its strong form, and linguistic relativism
in its weak form. Determinism, the ""strong"" version,
is a popular trope in fiction, particularly science fiction. Which is where it belongs! The film Arrival made it a major
plot point and actually name-checked it. ""If you immerse yourself into
a foreign language, that you ""can actually rewire your brain?"" ""The Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis.""
""Hmm."" The short story it's based on is much better. Linguistic determinism is not taken very
seriously by the linguistics community, as it's easily disprovable. Either by attending a Philosophy 101 course,
or just thinking about the phrase, ""I wish I could find the words
to explain how I feel."" But the weak form, linguistic relativism,
is much more broadly accepted. It is a difficult and messy thing
to test for and prove, though. You can find a lot of people
claiming that the Russian language has no word for ""privacy"", because the concept of 'privacy' isn't
part of traditional Russian culture? That might be true, I'm not Russian,
I couldn't tell you, but that wouldn't be language
limiting the way you think, that would be language
reflecting the way you think. There have been studies
that show things like: German speakers, whose language
says that 'key' is 'masculine', are more likely to describe a key
as 'jagged', 'rough', and 'hard', whereas Spanish speakers,
where 'key' is 'feminine', would be more likely to use
'golden' or 'intricate'. I've referred to that
exact study here in the past. But when other researchers tried
to replicate that study, they didn't find the same result, which is something that
keeps happening across psychology
and other fields. And besides, it's very difficult
to tease apart the impacts of your culture and
the impacts of your language. Even if that result is true,
which it's probably not… is the gendered language the cause,
or the effect? There are some clear impacts on how different languages, not cultures,
affect the brain. For example, our hearing tunes
into the phonology, the sounds, of the languages we speak. In Hindi, for example,
[tʰal] and [tal] are two different words,
platter and rhythm, because [tʰ] and [t] are considered
different sounds, based on the aspiration,
that air that comes out. That's not a cultural value,
that's not ideology, it's not passed down
deliberately to children. That's just language. If you speak a language
with that distinction, your brain will hear it
automatically and unconsciously. And if you don't, you have to try
to actively listen for it. That's a pretty clear way that
languages impact thought. But that doesn't feel close enough
to the science fiction, does it? It's not like it's changing your
understanding of the world. Science fiction wants the
language you speak to affect the categories
in your head, the way you understand the world, particularly for abstract concepts,
rather than actual physical things. So what about emotions? Emotions do get categorized in different ways by different humans
all over the world. In English, we can use the same word
for two different feelings. If someone says ""I'm sad"", do they mean
""crying in the corner"" or ""depressed, tired,
and staying in bed""? Those are both sad in the same way that the sky
and the ocean are both blue. But even if a child
only knows the word ""sad"", they've not heard of ""despondent'
or 'listless' or 'morose' or 'ennui', well, the underlying emotions
are still different, they can still tell whether someone's grieving the devastating loss of
their cartoonishly large lollipop or whether they're just tired
and generally down. Having the different words is really
helpful for expressing yourself, but they don't determine
your ability to feel emotions. And Ancient Greek had a
lot of words for love: in English those are all
basically translated as 'love' with a lot of extra notes, but even though we only have
one basic word to explain all those
feelings and emotions, we still experience them, and we can communicate them
without knowing Ancient Greek. It just takes a few more words. Until recently, English did not
have a word for ""feeling joy at
someone else's misfortune"", but we still definitely
experienced it before we borrowed
""schadenfreude"" from German. So the simple answer
to the question is: no. Not really. It might change how
you listen to sounds, it might make some things
easier to explain, but the idea that
you can stop people bringing down the government
by changing their language is, thankfully, just fiction. And if you want even more linguistics,

""Lingthusiasm"". The link is on screen

XQIu5tZ0vbQ,"0-100 km/h
is the standard test for how fast a car accelerates. The Brits call it
""nought to sixty"" mph. An everyday road car
with a bit of power can do that in
six or seven seconds. A Formula One car, about two seconds. As I record this, the fastest-accelerating
road-legal car in the world is the Rimac Nevera,
which can go from 0 to 100km/h
in 1.85 seconds. This is ""mythen"", built by a team
from ETH Zurich, a Swiss university, and it hits 100km/h
in under a second. - This car is the current holder
of the world record in acceleration from 0-100km/h
for electric vehicles. For the world record project,
we brought together a team of alumni and current team members, some are students,
some are recent graduates. We took a car that was fully designed
by students, we modified it. That also allowed some of the members
that are still students to do research and make a master thesis. - And I'm about to get in it and do that. But there is quite a history of
floppy-haired British presenters getting into high-speed vehicles
and ending up in hospital, so I've got a lot of safety
briefing to do first. - To build a car that can go
this fast, you really need to go down to the first
principles of physics. You need to be able to put
enough force into the ground in a very short amount of time. Just pure grip reaches its limits at around 1½ seconds, approximately. To get more force into the ground,
we use a self-developed system, which we call ""power ground effect"". We suck the air out underneath the car
from a big plate, and this pulls the car to the ground to make the car accelerate faster. We use two fans that power up
shortly before launch to pull the car down, to be able to create
that under-pressure. However, for the back wheels,
we need more torque. So for this, we developed
a new generation of motors that has approximately
twice the amount of torque. Each of the motors has
approximately the same power as a small hatchback. - Everything is custom, self-designed,
so it's quite expensive. The main source of parts is from
our sponsors from the industry. We also get a lot of
support from the university. Our mission is not to build race cars,
it is to build up engineers. - At world record pace, a lightweight driver in here
pulls 3.8 Gs peak acceleration. I'm going to add about
30 more kilos of weight, so I'm not going to quite hit that pace,
but it's going to be close. It's almost as fast as the catapult that launches fighter jets
from aircraft carriers. It's faster than any rollercoaster launch apart from one in Japan
that's currently closed because it kept shattering people's bones. There are cars which take
off faster than ""mythen"" here, but they're top fuel dragsters
running on nitromethane, loud enough to cause hearing damage, and not suitable for anything other than going in
a straight line for a few seconds. And yes, I will just be going in
a straight line for a few seconds but in theory, I could go
round an actual racetrack. - Electrically, the main danger
is high voltage. There are emergency buttons. Push that button to turn off the car. If there is, for example,
a fire in the car, the driver has to be
able to get out quickly. It's something we have to train
just to be quick enough. - That was 6.6.
- [sighs] - You have to be able to exit
the car within five seconds. - Go. - Clear! - 4.6.
- That'll do. - It's absolutely difficult to describe
because it's only a second. It's a really surreal experience because you don't really
believe it just happened. You go into acceleration mode,
roll to the start, initiate power ground effect, which will suck you to the floor. - PG, active. - Both fans active.
- Yeah. - Oh boy. Okay. - You will have to pull on the buttons behind the steering wheel
and then push throttle. And then when you release there is a split second
where nothing happens but then you will get launched. - Flaps. Throttle. [shouts] Holy...! What! - After you have reached a hundred kmh, the car will shut down. - What?
- And then you can slowly go on the brakes. - What? That was the longest second
of my life. I... Was that really only like
one and a bit seconds? That felt like five.
- That was faster. - That felt like five seconds. - Pretty much dead on 1.4 seconds. - 1.4? I mean, it's your
round of applause folks. Congratulations. That's a heck of a thing."
CkZyZFa5qO0,"Is this introduction weird? Yes, it's. If ""it's"" is just a contraction
of ""it"" and ""is"", then why doesn't that work? In fact, why didn't English
just do a find-and-replace on all the contractions? I'm sure there'dn't've been
any problems with that. Ah. Well, how do we understand
where the problem's with this? I was supposed to've'd a
brilliant idea here, but it appears... it'sn't. Okay, let's expand those back out. That took me about
seventeen takes to get right. Why don't those
contractions work? Let's talk about ""it's"" in that
introductory line. ""It"" is just a pronoun,
doing its job, referring to something that's
established earlier or obvious from context.
But what's the ""'s""? You can't even really
say it on its own. It's just kind-of leaning on
the ""it"" for substance. Which is why the technical term
for it is ""clitic"", from the Ancient Greek ""enklitikos"",
meaning ""to lean on"". A clitic is a part of speech that
can't exist just on its own. Now, we've talked about things
like this before: prefixes, suffixes and
other affixes, things that attach to words
like ‘-able' or ‘un-'. But a clitic isn't one of those. And we know that because it doesn
t attach to individual words: it attaches to a phrase,
a bigger part of speech. So using a prefix or affix, you can go from a dog to a proto-dog or an anti-dog
or an astro-dog. Or you can say that something
is ""dog-ish"". Those all attach to the word ""dog"". If you add some detail, you say
""my beautiful, green, astro-dog"", not ""my astro-beautiful, green, dog"".
That doesn't work. For a clitic, it's different. ""My astro-dog's been learning tricks."" There's the clitic, just after ""dog"". Let's add some more detail. ""My astro-dog from Jupiter's
been learning tricks."" That movement of 's,
within the sentence, means it can't be an affix;
the ‘s behaves like it's the whole word, like it's ""has"".
Not ""is""… ""has"". All that means that ‘s has to be
in its own category, it's a clitic. But that doesn't explain why
it doesn't work sometimes. If it was always possible to contract
‘is' and ‘has' down like that, there might be an argument that
it's just a pronunciation thing? There has to be some additional reason that means ""it'sn't"" and ""yes, it's""
are ungrammatical. Now, if you want the full answer
to that, you can read Anderson's ""Aspects of the
Theory of Clitics"", but a quick warning, it is 287 pages long
not including the references and indices. So to summarize as best as I can
for English: there are two reasons. The first is what's called a Syntactic Gap which means the presence
of the clitic strongly implies that another
word should follow. I think Anderson's best example is: ""Who do you think you're?"" ...who do you think you're what?
Meeting? Talking to? It feels like there
should be another word in that syntactic gap, the clitic is ""stranded""
at the end. And flipping that around,
if you say ""Who do you think
you are meeting?"", the sentence feels…
not ungrammatical, but maybe a little
awkward and robotic. And very much tied to that
is the second reason: stress patterns. Part of the reason these forms
can be reduced so much is because they're generally
unstressed, or weak. They're pronounced quieter
and less distinctly. You cannot stress a clitic, and
it sounds weird when you try. So let's try! If a child's parent is pestering them
because they haven't cleaned up, the kid can reply
""i AM going to do it"", that's called ‘rejoiner emphasis', but they can't say
""iMMM going to do it"". Doesn't work. So if the verb would contextually
be in its weak form, unstressed, and it also starts with
/w/, /h/, or a vowel, it can get even more reduced
to this clitic form. So, we get ""we'll,"" ""they've,""
""you'd,"" I'm,"" and so on. Repeat enough times,
they become grammaticalized, and they start to get
written like that as well. In theory, something like
""there'd'n't've'"" could work. After all, ""shouldn't've"" is grammatical
in spoken English, as in ""I shouldn't've done that."" Actually, in my dialect,
if I'm talking quickly, I pronounce that as either /ʃədənə/
or even just /ʃədn/. Like, ""/ʃədn/ done that"". Languages change and evolve over time,
words become clitics, can stay that way for a while and then eventually they may
start to sound ungrammatical to future generations.
After all, we used to say ""'tis"" not ""it's"",
so who knows: in a century or two,
maybe ""there'd'n't've"" will be perfectly
unremarkable English. If you want more detail about this,
there's a whole episode on my co-author Gretchen McCulloch's
podcast ""Lingthusiasm"", the link is on screen
or in the description."
ZgDBIzClmPg,"Over the years that
I've been making videos, I've visited quite a few strange
elevators and lifts. And every time I do, I get emails from
people in Germany, saying ""what about the one in
the New Town Hall in Hanover?"" And look, I don't want to become
'that weird elevator guy', but... I finally made it. - This New Town Hall is the only one
in the whole of Germany with a dome. That's the first specialty, and another one is, of course,
our curved elevator. That's the only one in the world. The elevator was opened in 1913, at the same time as
this building was finished. They didn't want to change the
design of this building, otherwise they had
to install this elevator just in the middle
of the main hall. So they found one spot
on this building, one small tower, and the elevator follows the
form of the cupola. It starts in the third floor
of this building, 42 meters high,
8.3 meters sideways. This elevator technik
was developed during the construction
of this building. - Elevators were already fairly
common in high buildings by the time this
was constructed, but this elevator has a
unique design requirement. It means to travel up
the side of a dome. The whole elevator shaft is curved. It's not a diagonal straight line
like the Eiffel Tower lifts. The track bends as it goes up,
about 17°. And it doesn't bend evenly.
It's not a smooth curve. The path the elevator takes
is irregular and lumpy. That would be a design challenge today,
let alone a century ago. The new elevator was built by
the company Lutz from Hamburg. You cannot use this elevator
the whole year, because in the winter it's very slippery
there on the dome. So each spring, there are
many Hanover people who cannot wait to see again
Hanover from above. - The various parts and mechanisms
of the original lift were replaced over the years, and in 2007, what was left
was ripped out. A few months later, this brand new
elevator was completed. And it only just fits. At points, there's only 5mm of clearance
between the cabin and the wall. At other places, there's lots more. Apparently, during testing
and construction, it did bump and scrape
the walls sometimes. Like I said, the path is lumpy. Oh, and also, the floor panels
of this new lift? They can be transparent. Obvious question: how do they keep the cabin
vertical as it goes up? I assumed this would have some kind of clever
self-levelling mechanism, like a funicular railway, or the
tram at Gateway Arch in St Louis. Or maybe a floor with
hydraulics in it, so it would stay level
as the cabin moved around it. But no. The solution is simple.
They don't keep the floor level! The whole cabin is just
dragged up the side as one. I can't lean on these doors,
but I want to. I'm leaning on this pole. We started out on the ground
at a slight angle, passed through vertical
about halfway up, and we ended up leaning
a little bit the other way. Because a floor with a tilt
of a few degrees isn't really a big problem
for a short journey. So there you go. Germany,
you can stop emailing me. I have finally taken a
trip on your elevator. For a video about
an elevator ride, that was a lot of steps."
TFpzps-DCb0,"The most common words that languages
borrow from each other are nouns, words for things, probably
since it's fairly straightforward to point at an object,
say the word for it, and have the other person understand
that’s what you’re talking about. Things like ""fire"" or ""chicken"" are
easier concepts to communicate than, say, ""awesome"" or ""the"", and probably more immediately useful
for trade and the basics of living. Also, there are so many things that
humans give different names to. So if you go through a list of loanwords
into a particular language, lots of them will be
creatures and objects that speakers of that language would
never have encountered at home. That’s the first of the two main ways
that words get moved between languages: as loanwords. Through most of history,
people would go to a new place, ask what the name of a local thing is,
get a response, and then start calling the thing that name. Sometimes, though, the word they were given
wasn't a name so much as a description of what the thing was,
or a category. We don't know the exact derivation,
but some North American languages use a word like ""pakan"" for any hard nut. But it became the English word for
the ""PE-can"" nut. Or ""pe-CAN"" nut. The Arabic word /sˤaħ.raːʔ/ for ""deserts""
became the English word specifically for the Sahara Desert.
So the Desert Desert. Which keeps happening!
Matcha tea is ""powdered tea tea"". The La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles
are ""the ‘the tar’ tar pits"". Timor Leste is East the East. There’s even the Milky Way Galaxy, galaxy comes from the Ancient Greek
""gala"" meaning milk, presumably because it looks like
milk spilled across the sky? There’s a lot of these! And that’s if the
translation stays intact! There’s a Tupi word, mbokaʔẽ́, which describes a way of
cooking meat over a fire, that was borrowed into
French as ""boucan."" Someone who used that method of
cooking meat because they were, say, on a long voyage,
was therefore a ""boucanier,"" or in English a ""buccaneer"". Or the word for a king in Persian,
/ʃɑːh/, was eventually borrowed over and over again across multiple languages
over centuries of trading to arrive in English as the words
""chess"" and ""check"". And ""shah,"" of course. Sometimes we borrow a word
that we already have, it’s just travelled by
a different route and been changed in
two different ways! Those are called doublets. ""Grain"" and ""corn"" both come from
the same Proto-Indo-European root, one directly inherited through
English's Germanic roots, and one through Romance languages. ""Ward"" and ""guard"" both come
from French at different times. And ""anime"" comes from Japan, which
borrowed ""animation"" from English! Often, when a word’s being borrowed,
the grammar doesn’t quite work out, the new language keeps the
other bits that are clinging on, called affixes and clitics, and those get baked into
the loanword itself. Loads of words in English that start
with al- come from Arabic. Albatross comes from al-ġaṭṭās,
""the diver"". Algebra from al-jabr, which originally
meant healing and resetting broken bones The term for this is ""rebracketing"". My favourite is admiral, which is said to come from amīr-al-mā
""commander of the water"" and amīr-al-bahr
""commander of the sea"". So ""admiral"" is sort of
""commander of the"", and then we just lost what
they were commander of. But English received those
loanwords from French, which might have got them from Latin? So every time they moved language
they got… well, remodelled a bit as speakers adapted them
to sound local. Because of course we do! Iif I suddenly go all Spanish mid-sentence
for something like ""Puerrrrto Rrrrrico"", I either sound pretentious or foolish or claiming to be a lot better
at Spanish than I actually am. I’m also going to
use that as an excuse for all my appalling pronunciations
of non-English words in this video. I’m sorry to the rest of the world. ..there’s a British sentence. So those are loanwords. The second way that words get translated
across languages is much simpler, and those words are called ""calques"". This is where a word is divided
into its component parts, each of which then gets translated. The most well-known example
is ""skyscraper"". In the first half of the
twentieth century, many languages were suddenly
in need of a word to describe buildings that are
really, really big. Now, tall sails on a ship were
already called ‘sky scrapers’, two words, and it’s possible that’s where
the word for the buildings came from, it got hyphenated and
then combined over time, like a lot of words do. But even languages who never had
the concept of ‘sky scraper’ sails just translated the two parts. And that leads to my favourite bit
of this whole thing: loanword is a copy of the German
word for the concept, Lehnwort. It has its two parts separately
translated and joined back together. Calque, on the other hand, is
borrowed directly from French. It means ""to copy or trace"". Which means that ""loanword""
is a calque, and ""calque"" is a loanword. If you want to know more about this,
then my co-author Gretchen McCulloch has an entire episode of the podcast
""Lingthusiasm"" about it, the link is in the description."
ZNVuIU6UUiM,"The British Library has a copy of
every book ever published in the UK. Or at least, it should have. If you're in the UK and you publish

We collect all of those. It's everything. - Down in the basement here, there's
obviously a huge amount of storage. But it's not enough. And here in London, land is expensive
and construction is difficult. So while there are millions of
books stored here, they're only the ones that are the most requested. The rest of them are
with the robots up north. - The library collection in total
is around 170 million items. The vast majority of
that is ""legal deposit"". - Often publishers know legal deposit
and will send them in. More of a challenge can be very
small publishers, or people who don't necessarily think
of themselves as publishers. So we put a lot of effort into reaching
out to authors, creators who self publish, all those kinds of organisations
to say that the work is really important
to be saved and preserved. In total, there are more than
700km of shelves, and most of them
are stacked up here, in one of the colossal
low-oxygen storage buildings in Boston Spa in Yorkshire. I was not allowed to attach a
camera to one of these robots, they are far too important. The library's using up those
shelves at about 8km per year, so they've just started construction on
their next storage building, which should be good
for a few decades. - Lots of the stuff that gets sent
out free tends to be ephemera, and it will be lost over time. A great example is a recent exhibition up
in the National Library of Scotland, all about the information that was provided at the very beginning of the AIDS epidemic. That material, if you go out to
somebody on the street and you ask them, ""Should we
be collecting this?"" ""No, of course we shouldn't."" But we're able to learn so much from that. We wouldn't have that exhibition if
we hadn't collected that free material that came through people's letterboxes. - If someone in London wants a
lesser-used book from these stacks, they need to give 48 hours' notice. It'll get picked out by these robots. They go up to 50 km/h. If you can hear wind rustling on my
mic, it's because they shove air out the way as
they travel through the stacks. And they automatically store items that
are used more often close to the front. The books are then put in a truck
south, to arrive in the reading rooms
a couple of working days later. More than a thousand items
go back and forth each day. But publication means
something different now. Not only are there books that are
only being publishedas digital files, but there's the web. - Legal deposit has expanded to include
publishing on the web, as long as we can identify that
as being within the UK. So if someone's creating a blog,
or creating their own website, we will try to collect that. The UK Web Archive has actually become one
of the largest parts of the collection. Billions of files, about
one and a half petabytes of data! - A digital newspaper, for example, is
very different from a print newspaper. So we have to make sure we
collect both because the editorial intent
of both is very different. And in addition to that,
there are emerging formats. You can read books which change
as you move the iPad around. You can read books that change
depending on your location. How do we capture that today, to
make it available for researchers in 10 years', 50 years' time? You know how often you have to change
the operating system on your phone! So it's quite difficult to
keep up with those changes. - I've used the British Library
for research a lot of times. The books you request can't
be borrowed and taken away. They have to stay with the researcher, at a desk inside one of the reading rooms,
returned after they're done. This is a library of last resort. If you want to get a library card here,
there will be a short interview about your research and
why you can't just pull the books or material you want
from your local or university library. - The importance of legal deposit not
being selective, and being everything, is: we can't decide today what's going
to be important in 50 years' time. We want everything, because we
don't know what will be important. - I cannot overstate just how
useful it is to be able to track down things that never made it online, or to research out
of print, forgotten books where there are no other copies available, or to scan through every issue
of an obscure local newspaper to track down one reference. This is the raw text of history,
as it happened, and someone has to keep it preserved for the future. How's that for timing? [camera op] ""That was brilliant.
Fantastic."" I wish I'd done that deliberately!"
Is_wu0VRIqQ,"I’m going to show you
two very short adverts. My question is:
which is louder? This video is sponsored by NordVPN. THIS VIDEO IS SPONSORED BY NORDVPN! Here’s the volume of the
nice, calm one. The second one?
With the shouting, the background noise,
the music? If you’re measuring volume
purely by decibels, then it was lower. But it definitely
sounded louder. To explain that, we need to start
at the beginning: what does it mean for
something to be loud? Let’s say a tree falls
in the forest. The tree causes
the air to move, both by pushing
it out the way, but also by the tree
and the things around it vibrating as they deal with
all the forces involved. Those vibrations are
transferred into the air. The actual air itself is not travelling from the
crashing tree to your ears, but rather it’s a wave caused by air molecules
bumping into each other. And if you’re standing nearby, then bits of that wave
get funnelled by the flappy bit of your ear,
the pinna, into your ear canal. The waves get to your eardrum,
and it vibrates in turn, just a tiny, tiny amount. Behind it, there’s the three
smallest bones in the human body: the hammer, anvil, and stirrup. They amplify those vibrations
through leverage, and deliver these vibrations
into the cochlea, shaped like a snail shell, which converts it into
electrical impulses that get interpreted by the brain. If you ask a physicist,
those air movements are sound. Ask a psychologist,
and they’ll say that until those movements get
interpreted by the brain, it’s just stuff moving,
because sound is in your head, it’s an experience. If the tree falls in the forest
and no-one’s there to listen, a physicist says there’s sound,
a psychologist says there isn’t. And both of them are correct because they’re using the same
word to mean different things, which is part of why it takes
so long to answer what seems like a simple question. So. Let’s talk about that wave. It’s got two important values: the amount of pressure for each peak,
the amplitude; and the time between each
peak arriving, the frequency. We’ll start with the amplitude. Pressure is measured in pascals,
and regular air at about sea level has a pressure of somewhere around
100,000 pascals: that’s the weight of all the
atmosphere above pushing down. Our ears can detect a fluctuation
of about 20 micropascals. A whisper in your ear would be
about 2 millipascals, and traffic noise
about 200 millipascals. And someone screaming at the
top of their voice, directly into your ear,
is around 20 pascals, which is well into the sorts of
pressure that can cause hearing loss. Okay, as you might have noticed,
that’s not a particularly useful graph, because the differences
in scale are enormous, even if we get rid of the
ambient pressure at the top. So instead, let’s use a
logarithmic scale, which means that each block
going vertically is ten times the previous one. That’s much clearer:
just remember, this is a 10 times
jump in pressure, and so’s this,
and so’s this. That’s how decibels work. That minimum that humans can
detect, 20 micropascals, is taken as 0 bels, and then each 10-times increase
in pressure adds two bels, and we generally use
tenths of those, so each 10-times increase
is another 20 decibels. And I know, a load of sound engineers
and techies are already in the comments going “no, no, each ten times increase
is 10 decibels, you fool!” and here’s reason two why this
is so difficult to answer: there are multiple decibel scales! Because sound engineers
talk about intensity, the amount of power transmitted, not the amount of actual pressure
on your eardrum, those two things are proportional, and look, it doesn’t matter for this, just …blame mathematicians, okay?
The important thing is: your brain doesn’t interpret
“ten times more change in pressure” to mean “ten times as loud”. Sure, traffic noise feels
louder than a whisper, but I don’t think many people
would guess that the amplitude is a hundred times more pressure. That’s why we use decibels, a logarithmic scale matches
how we think about sound. Hold that thought. That’s amplitude dealt with.
Next is frequency. And that’s easy to define: it’s just the number of peaks per second,
or ‘hertz’. The human ear can detect roughly
from 20 Hz through to 20,000 Hz, although that starts to decrease
as people get older. The sound wave is going to be
much more complex, of course, it’s usually not transmitting
just a single frequency, but let’s not get into the
maths of that too much! We’re particularly sensitive to the
range between 2,000 and 5,000 Hz, which means our brains perceive
those frequencies as being louder. In 1933, Harvey Fletcher and
Wilden A. Munson published this, which became known as the
Fletcher-Munson curve. They played different sounds
at different levels and noted how their test subjects
perceived that sound. The curve has been updated and
refined over time, and now it’s usually called
the Equal Loudness Contour. So if you want this tone... and this tone... to feel as loud as each other, you need to play the low one… I want to say louder,
but that’s not right. You’d need to play the low one
with greater amplitude. And of course, science has a
measuring system for this too. Audio engineers and broadcast companies
came up with LUFS, Loudness Units Full Scale. The calculations for this take
the loudness contour into account, along with how long
the loud sounds last. LUFS are a scientific way to measure
how loud something should feel, not how much the air
happens to be moving. If you’re making a video
for YouTube or Netflix, or music for Spotify or iTunes, there are guides for you
to follow. YouTube asks you to
aim for -14 LUFS – the units are kinda arbitrary,
it’s just a number. If you upload something that’s
louder than that, they’ll just turn the player’s
volume setting down automatically, in the background, so people
don’t suddenly get startled if one video or music track
is louder than another. So that means if you’re making
a movie or a TV show, and you want your loud sounds
to have impact, you can’t turn them up
above the limit, you have to turn the dialog and speech
and all the other sounds down. Not too much, that’ll also
cause problems, but enough that when the big explosion happens,
it’s noticeable. It's audible. But advertisers don’t need
or want the nuance, they just want to be heard, they usually want to be as loud
as they can be throughout. The European Union specifies -23 LUFS
as its target for broadcasters, to try and keep adverts and
programmes at the same loudness. The US has no specific guidelines
but says that broadcasters should try to match the two – although that rule is
rarely, if ever, enforced. All of which is to say that the whisper
of that first advert? The sound waves had higher amplitude, your eardrum will have vibrated
further back and forth. But it didn’t feel as loud. There were more decibels,
but fewer LUFS. And these days,
it’s the LUFS that matter. SERIOUSLY. THIS NORDVPN ADVERT

_G2Q1qsoGEU,"Across Western Europe,
if you know what to look for, you can find long barrows, bumps in the landscape
a few dozen metres long, built up of earth and
stone or timber, thousands of years ago. Some of them contain
the bones of the dead, so they might have been tombs,
or churches, or... well, we don't know. They're prehistoric,
in the very literal sense: they were made before
written records. So if you ask three archaeologists
what long barrows were used for, you'll probably get
four different opinions. They fell out of use, but there's still tens of thousands
of them across Europe, often hidden into the landscape. But this one... this one is new. - It was finished for the
Winter Solstice of 2020. In terms of physical construction, was probably a little more
than 12 months. My friend Tim Daw, who was the
steward of Stonehenge for a long time, had the idea to revive long barrows and built the first new one
in Wiltshire on his farm and then the stonemasons were
looking for another farmer who wanted to host
this kind of project. When I was a little boy, we used
to have holidays in Anglesey, and some of the original barrows were at the bottom of the beach
that we were staying by. So I knew exactly
what it was instantly and how beautiful
it would be. - This is of one a very small
number of long barrows that have been constructed
in this millennium. And while there
aren't bones inside, this is what's
called a columbarium: there are niches for
the ashes of the dead. I've been told, several times, that
I don't need to whisper in here. But I feel like I should,
I was taught there should be respect for
the dead by keeping quiet, but this space is not meant
to be quiet as tomb. The main chamber, here, has
been used as a theatre, it's been used for celebrations
of lives that have passed. There is capacity for a hundred
people in this main chamber. A hundred living people, that is. And someone had to calculate that. - The Neolithic ones stood for
five and a half thousand years, but they didn't have concrete
and rebar and a fire exit, which, in order to satisfy insurers, is in this structure
in a couple of places, just because the scale
is what it is. Everything had to be tested a lot,
in terms of engineering specifications, to be completely happy that
it would last a very long time. Accessibility laws are very important. In the original barrows,
if you visit them, you'll have to crawl into them.
There'll be no lighting. And it's a lovely experience and a sort of high five with
people thousands of years ago. But it's not really
where we need to be now. - This place was constructed by
stonemasons, and while they had modern planning tools
and computer-aided design, the stones were placed by hand. And yes, like a lot of
prehistoric long barrows, the sun lines up with
the entrance and exit on the summer solstice. - So I think a lot of people
will assume that getting the alignments of a
monument like this, or indeed Stonehenge,
would involve complex calculations and a
sharp pencil and computing power. But in fact, you can do it
just as easily by getting up at the right time
with some sticks. And as long as it's not cloudy,
the shadows line up. - Humanity's invented a lot of
things since history began, including capitalism. Talented stonemasons cost money, it is not cheap to build
and maintain a long barrow, so it needs a business plan. These niches will all
fill up over time, but just like in most columbariums
around the world, the ashes stored here
will not be stored forever. - It's very difficult to talk
about this sensitively without running the risk of
hurting people, but: a company called Sacred Stones run the open days and
handle purchasing of niches, and I'm looking after
the landscape and the farming. It involves a lot of materials and
a lot of skilled labour to do this. In order that the monument
can still be here, it needs to be looked after, which means people need
to be caring about it in centuries to come. And under
a system of capitalism, the people doing that work
need to be paid. There is a commercial transaction that
exists around when people sadly die. And it's become very efficient, but
it hasn't become very beautiful. If we think about what happens
at a contemporary crematorium, then you have quite a
drive-through experience, timers on how long a ceremony can be, you can buy mass produced,
manufactured urns and things. And here, people are commissioning
artists, locally, to take, say, some of the clay from
this landscape and then make an urn. Or commissioning a
stained glass artist or someone who carves wood
to do fretwork niche covers. It could be one very small
niche for a year, or it could be one
very large niche for multiple members of one family
for, essentially, a century. The longest relationship that
we can make is 99 years. Churchyards will not give you
more than 99 years, by law in the UK. They can extend and renew their
relationship for another century if they want to,
generation over generation. But if not, if the niche is
wanted by someone else, and a century has gone by, then the ashes are respectfully
scattered around here. You have to take the whole process
extremely seriously, because the people who you're
helping are quite vulnerable. It's quite a culturally
sensitive project to revive something that was obviously
sacred to another culture that we can't properly understand. - You'll see details in here that relate to different original
barrows around the country. And I like to think that if a
Neolithic farmer, and they were the first farmers,
were to visit this, they might not necessarily
think we got it right, but they would at least think that
we were sympathetic and respectful. - A long barrow, like any memorial,
isn't built for the dead. It's built for the living,
to provide a focus point, a space to remember
and to reflect. And here, that's not just about
the recently deceased: it's about those who were here
millennia before us."
nbafT2w0cCQ,"- Sometimes I'm able
to do a lot of research before going to a place, and sometimes I have to just wing it. Here's what I know. Every year, this town, Honiton in
south-west England, has a tradition where they
throw hot pennies off balconies down onto waiting crowds
who try to catch them. Apparently, this started
more than 700 years ago as part of the local fair. Back then, the pennies
would be scalding hot. And part of the entertainment,
at least for the people throwing, was watching poor people
burn themselves as they scrambled to
pick up the pennies. Back then, pennies were
worth a lot more, very roughly, it'd be
the equivalent of throwing £1 coins
off a balcony, so perhaps worth minor burns
if you're desperate? Seven centuries later,
they do still throw pennies. But I'm assured they're
not scalding, just merely warm. And that is all I know.
My script ends here, but I'm hoping I can find out more
from the folks who run it and also not get injured
by flying pennies. - This is my first Hot Pennies
as the Mayor of Honiton. I've been coming to
Hot Pennies all my life. It's led predominantly by
the town crier. It's his event, if you like,
and I'm gatecrashing it. - I'm the town crier and
mace bearer of Honiton. I've held this position for 27 years and today, the Hot Pennies Ceremony
will be my 28th. We toss pennies from balconies, windows and if you're brave enough to scramble for them,
pick them off the floor, they're all yours to take home. - People are pretty much
sorting themselves out by height so the kids are going to the front. The adults are coming to the back. I hope they're going to be okay. I hope I'm going to be okay! - I've been on the committee,
believe it or not, for 46 years, and this is my 47th Honiton Hot Pennies. When Honiton was granted a Royal Charter, they held a fair and of course, they wanted people to come into
the town to make it a success, but quite a lot of those people hadn't paid their landlords their rent so it was decided that they would
give an amnesty during fair week. And whilst the glove was hoisted, no man will be arrested. - [SHOUTS] No man shall be arrested. - [CROWD CHANTS] No man shall be arrested. - I've only just thought to bring
something to catch the pennies and it's far too late. Like, there's people with
upside down umbrellas, there's kids with buckets,
and I, uh... wish me luck. - Honiton is famous as
one of the staging points on the Exeter to London Road, and there were more pubs on Honiton High Street
than most towns have. There were wealthy people
who lived in the town and who stayed in the inns and they used to take delight
in throwing out hot pennies and watching the serfs, I suppose,
burn their fingers. - Here we go. Bloody hell! Oh! Augh! Ow. I took my eye off the pennies
for a moment. - It's 802 years, this year. We think. There would've been a few breaks
over the years for World War whatever. For years, it's run on nothing because all the pennies are
collected in jars in the pubs and we do throw out hundreds and hundreds of
pounds' worth of pennies. - All the pubs would have a large bottle
or a can or a tray and people would put
their loose change in it. Nowadays you have to order the pennies two weeks in advance from the banks
to even have them. - Come on! It's one penny. It's one penny, but I'm really
proud of the penny. Can confirm, slightly warm. - They used to be heated up. They were literally heated
in the ovens of the pubs. There was a stream running down
one of the sides of the high street. So there's photographs of kids
in the drains pulling pennies out, but also cooling them because they've got burns on their hands. And I believe there's a lady in Honiton
who, to this day, carries a scar from being burnt by a
penny in the mid-'60s. - They used to be proper hot,
I mean, burning, scalding hot, and if you caught them on your arm, I do have a friend from school and he claims that he still has a scar and he's really proud
of his Hot Pennies scar. But they'd be scattering on the floor
and it would hurt to pick them up. - They've got a kid throwing up there and he's very much
throwing at, and not... ...augh! and not up. - We used to wear gloves, hobnail boots, old clothes and then when we got back in school, we'd given 100 yards for skiving off. - It seems crazy now that we used to get
tossed boiling hot coins especially when we were
little young children. But to be honest, that was half the fun! - I'm well out of range here. I did not fight hard enough to be
in the crowd with the umbrellas. I'm going to cut my losses
with two pennies and one slightly injured camera operator, I'm so sorry! - It was quite a wild event. Nowadays we have to have
a little bit more careful so the pennies are scattered
rather than thrown. They're warmed in the sun
at best, or at worst depending on
where you look at it. We hope we don't have injuries. We're about making certain that these wonderful old
quaint customs continue."
R2oD1ZHNMFE,"- One of the problems with urban planning is that change is difficult. Most towns are built around cars. Many of them want to switch to something that's more
transit-friendly and walkable, but it's a very slow
and difficult process. But what if the car never arrived? What if your town was so
inaccessible for so long that, by the time it became
possible for cars to drive in, the people decided they didn't want them? This is Zermatt, a ski resort in the Alps
in southern Switzerland, and this is the
end of the valley. There's no easy way past those mountains. You can't drive in here. There is a road, but it's
narrow and twisting, and only open if you
get special permission and pay quite a large fee. And even then, you can't
get into the town proper. Instead, the next town
over has a lot of parking and a train to shuttle
tourists back and forth. It used to be that the only vehicles here were horse-drawn carriages. But in the 1980s, Zermatt modernized, jumping straight past petrol cars
and internal combustion engines, and going fully electric, with some very specific requirements. - We don't have private cars. The hoteliers and all the builders
and all the taxis of course, can't go just by bicycle,
so they ask. The local government
makes the decision. The business people have
to send us the paper: ""Why you need a vehicle?"" And then, we have this checklist. We give them permission,
maybe for three years. And if the business is running,
he can keep it. But if you are a person like...
Tom Scott, why'd you need one? ""Yeah, I live up here.
It's very difficult to go up there."" Then we would say, ""Sorry,
you can take a taxi."" And all the deliverers,
they have a car, but not the shops, also
not the restaurants. We are really strict that, since 20 years,
we have around 520 vehicles. - If you grew up in Britain
around the same time as I did, you might be thinking,
""Those are milk floats"". And yes, it's basically
the same technology: a battery electric vehicle
with a very long service life, designed for decades of low speed use, to be fixed easily if it breaks, and to make a minimum of noise. In the 20th century, British dairies
used fleets of vehicles like that for delivering bottles of milk
to millions of homes every morning. Which seems weird these days,
but then, so does a lot of the 20th century. Zermatt here used these
vehicles for everything. Taxis are the most obvious one,
but buses, trucks, the police car;  they all looked like that, and many of them were designed
and built locally by a company just over there that started out with
horse-drawn taxis. - It took me a while to notice something
as I walked around Zermatt. In every city, in every town, there is a constant quiet roar
of traffic noise from somewhere,  even if it's off in the distance. And here, there just isn't.
It's missing. And that's really obvious at night, but right now, of course,
that's very difficult to demonstrate because
there's construction, there's the rush of the river that's really audible
from this vantage point; it's carrying all the glacier-melt
water down the valley. There are helicopters and trains, but at night when everything's calm, there's no traffic noise. And while I know it's a one-off, and I know it only works because this is a small, rich and very expensive
ski resort with a weird history  that's outsourced its parking
to the next town over...! I can't help thinking that it'd be nice if more towns and cities
sounded like that. - Everybody knows the rules. The children grow up with this. ""Can I have a car?""
""Are you crazy?"" So, it's in the mind from the locals. When I tell people from Switzerland, ""We are living in a town
without petrol cars,"" they say, ""How you manage?"" ""By bicycle, or by foot, or by bus?""
""Ah. Huh."" So, they can't believe it. But if you are in this system,
then it's so normal."
85BykUan6pw,"I'm not a philosopher,
so I'm going to dodge the many complicated ethical
questions about cryonics, about freezing someone's body
after they die in the hope that future science will
not just unfreeze them, but also cure them of
whatever ended their life. The philosophical side of this is way
outside what I'm qualified to talk about! And honestly, my opinion
would not be helpful. I will say that I think death is
a bad thing, and that humanity should be trying to defeat it,
the same way we've defeated smallpox. But that is a controversial opinion. The questions I do have for
the folks that run this actual cryonics facility
are practical and legal. As ever, this is not an advert.
The team here have no editorial control. I just got invited to see a place
where the dead are being stored in the hope of resurrection. - Currently, there's still very
few patients stored here. It's more than zero, but you can
count it on a very few hands. The exact number we only release
once we have a few more, to not have any potential privacy
problems, but it's very few so far. - The company's official website
describes the bodies in there as ""patients"", but what's being stored
are, legally and medically, corpses. Not people. The people have been declared
legally dead, and their assets have passed to their descendants. The cryo process cannot start
until the person is declared dead, because otherwise it's murder. So if someone who's signed up is
close to death, the company will dispatch a very
non-standard ambulance. - There needs to be the least possible
delay between the heart stops and the
cool-down procedure being started. And of course, only if the patient has
given informed consent before dying. And then we start practically
three procedures at the same time. One is we start cooling
down as quick as possible. There's a saying in medicine
that says: ""you're only dead if you're
warm and dead"". The metabolic rate of the cell
goes down and the cell dies slower. We also start very aggressive, what
is similar to CPR, chest compressions, giving oxygen and so on, to give
some amount of metabolic support. And before you cross 0°C, you want to replace all the blood
and the rest of the water against a medical grade antifreeze. It's very important to say:
we don't freeze anything. Though, of course, the headline
always says ""this organization is freezing people""
and so on! In more technical terms, we vitrify
them, which is a glass-like amorphous state, which allows tissue to be stored
without any further damage, in a state where potentially future technology
might be able to, well, resuscitate. - The cryo process causes massive, probably
unrecoverable damage to the body. There is no technology, now or
even vaguely on the horizon, that could reverse that damage. But whatever is left: patient, corpse,
assembly of frozen stuff, gets stacked up in stainless steel containers here, submerged in liquid nitrogen, until... Well, until it's possible to recover
them, which could very well be never. So, obvious question, how does a dead
person pay for a service that, if all goes to plan,
will continue indefinitely? - While someone is alive, there's a small
membership fee with us, and then at the time of death,
it's around €200,000. But this is a one time fee. The largest part is given to
a non-profit organisation. They invest that money, with around 1-2% above inflation
in return expectations, sufficient then to
maintain cryopreservation. And you have that money that you
put aside, inflation adjusted in the future, for, well, whatever medical
procedure might be necessary, to pay for reintegration, for retraining, to get used to the future again. One of the goals of our organization
is to, over time, not only make the cryopreservation procedures
better, but also make it significantly more affordable. Somewhere in the mid-five-figure range,
maybe, should be possible over time. - A reminder, that's the CEO of the company. His view is going to be biased. But one of the reasons I was comfortable
filming here is that he was very candid about
the chances of this working. - We would never state that there's
any ""X percent"" that this works. Cryopreservation is not
a medical procedure. It's a research procedure. No one in the world can say if and
when cryopreservation might work. Long term storage is always
done with foundations. We have bylaws and statutes that make
the foundation, from a day-to-day perspective, very slow, very sluggish, and
there's a lot of inertia to change stuff. All of that is there to
maximize for longevity. I would like to live on as long as I can,
and as long as I want to. I don't only want that for me, but I
think that should be everybody's right. Ideally, I would never
like to be cryopreserved. I would like to do whatever treatments
there will be when I'm 95, and whatever medication I need to take
when I'm 60, to then make that happen. Should I die at 60 of a heart attack
or something like that, then I'd much rather be cryopreserved
than being cremated or buried. It might turn out it never works, but the alternative has as close to zero
a chance as you can ever have. - This, right now, is an option for
a tiny minority of rich people, and it probably won't work. But I do think that humanity should
be trying to defeat death, so I find it difficult to argue against
someone who'd take this option... when I know what the alternative is."
xq4ZkfojSis,"I've got to admit to a
little bit of a lie. If you saw last week's video
about grizzly bear product testing, the bit about the camera
seemed pretty simple: I stuck a GoPro on top
of the trash can, it got knocked away
at some point when the bear
turned the can over, it stopped recording,
and then later the bear picked it up,
chewed on it a bit, and then dropped it
in a pond. And obviously, I was able
to recover it, because the footage from
that camera is in the video. ...yeah, okay, that's not
what actually happened. It's how my editor and I
chose to tell the story, because the reality was
a bit more complicated and it wasn't relevant to the
main point, so we simplified it. There were actually two GoPros. The first was on top
of the trash can, it really did get
knocked off. It recorded for about 30 minutes
before overheating, which honestly was far longer
than I thought it would given it was in a big protective case
in direct summer sunlight, in high temperatures.
 
It did its job, and once the bears  had gone back into their den,
 
I just picked it up off the floor. The other GoPro was
inside the trash can. It got knocked out of the can, and that was the one that
the bear carried off, chewed on, and dropped
in the pond. I assumed it was unrecoverable,
that it had been crushed, and besides, that pond is filled
with debris from the bears so it couldn't easily be found even if we could somehow
dredge the pond. But the team at the Grizzly & Wolf
Discovery Center did find it, just a couple of days ago
as I record this, when they drained the pond
for scheduled cleaning. I was back in Europe
by this point, but they posted it to
a friend of mine, Karen from the channel
Karen Puzzles. She does videos about
jigsaw puzzling, it's a really good channel. While the big protective case
had been broken, it was a write-off, the camera itself was
mostly in one piece, albeit a bit damp and
with a shattered screen. The memory card on it
was still good, and there is so much
incredible footage that it really does
deserve its own video, and this is that video. To start off, there's this shot of Randy filling up the trash can
and closing it, which honestly feels a bit sinister
from that point of view? Like, mafia-movie ""last thing
the victim sees"" vibes there? Anyway, the trash can
gets rolled out, and a few minutes later,
the bear approaches, pulls it on its side,
and starts what they call ""CPR behaviour"" to try
and crack it open. The bear's going to turn
the can over again now, so keep an eye out for
the shadow of the claws that looks like something
out of a horror movie. The sticky pad that's holding
the GoPro in place is somehow still working as the
bear rips the can open. It won't hold for long. Just going to give you a
slow-motion shot of those claws. This is not a cute and
cuddly creature, this is a wild animal
that can tear you apart. That's not a metaphor. Literally, a bear can
tear a person apart. Do I need to say ""don't
try this in the wild""? Like, that's the whole message
of the first video. Don't try to get footage
like this, do not risk making a wild bear even
slightly more used to humans. Okay, this continues
for quite a while as the bear keeps rotating the can,
so I'm going to skip forward. The sticky pad finally fails,
so the camera rolls around and gets covered in
peanut butter and honey. Which will be important shortly. For a while, the camera's not
looking anywhere useful. And then, about ten minutes later, the bear finally gets the can
all the way open, and gets its food reward. Eventually the bear spots
that the camera has some peanut butter
and honey and on it, and so... Now, the bear's not stupid,
it's not going to eat a lump of plastic like a camera, the worst case I could think of
would be if it chomped down and punctured the
camera battery? But even then it would
just spit it out. No-one at the Centre was
worried about the bears. Anyway, after that, the camera
finally overheats and turns itself off,
job done. A few minutes later,
the bear carries it off to play with it in the pond. Now, I knew the camera
had overheated, which is why I said this... ""Sadly, definitely not
recording any more."" ...but I was using the
GoPro app on my phone, trying to turn the
camera back on, and it kept showing weird
error messages, so that's why I figured
it had been crushed or otherwise damaged somehow,
and it was a write-off. Well, it wasn't. It was fine.
The protective case had held. A few minutes after it
got dropped into the pond, something hit the shutter button, and the camera had cooled down
enough that turned back on... and recorded half an hour
of murky water and bubbles before finally running out
of battery. But that's not the last
file on the memory card. Because if you let the
camera rest for a while, it might have just enough battery
to record a couple minutes more. And that is the selfie! It's very close-up
and it's accidental, but that is a selfie. Here's a slow motion replay of that
one horrible shot of the mouth. According to the timestamps
on the video, that's five hours later. Checking against the
Center's schedule, that means it's probably
the same bear, remembering the camera in
the bottom of the pond, picking it out,
playing with it for a while and somehow pushing
the shutter button, and then dropping it
back in the pond! And then, four hours
after that, one more file on the
memory card! No idea which bear that is. Just a few seconds of
footage of claws and the protective case coming off
with the last gasp of the battery. Which is probably where
the camera actually got broken. And I've realised something. Those final shots, just the last
two video files from the pond? That footage was entirely
created by bears, accidentally. I didn't set up the camera,
I didn't start it rolling, I had zero input into that footage. And so I'm pretty sure that for
just those specific shots, just that final bit in the pond... I don't have copyright over that. That's public domain. The bear made that on its own. Which is frustrating,
I think I could probably make a lot of
money licensing that, but instead, I've uploaded the raw files
to the Internet Archive, the link is in the description. And if you do use that in your own work, it'd be nice if you'd make a donation
to the Grizzly & Wolf Discovery Center. 'Cos they've got bears to feed. And as for the GoPro? The screen is a bit cracked,
it needed drying out but... it survived."
Oarf76MCrss,foreign foreign all right foreign
Xn_O2li_jpk,"When my plane landed here, the
flight attendant welcomed everyone to West Yellowstone, Montana,
and added: ""don't feed the bears"". There's a lot of reminders
not to do that. The whole of Yellowstone Park, which starts just a couple hundred
metres that way, is bear country. And hikers and campers heading
from this town into the wilderness will bring food with them. If the wind's in the right direction, then
a bear can smell that food miles away. Which isn't great for the humans,
who do not want a hungry grizzly bear that weighs a third of a ton rummaging
through and destroying their campsite. But it's not great for the bears either. Bears are relatively smart creatures, and if one of them makes
the connection between humans... and easily available food, it might start seeking out
campsites and homes, it might get aggressive. And in that case, it might
have to be... euthanized, killed. Not just for human safety, but because it might pass that behaviour
along to its cubs, and along to their cubs,
and suddenly, the wilderness isn't so wild anymore. So that's problem number one. There are rules for people going into
the park, and one of them involves keeping all your food in bear resistant
containers, a bit like these trash cans. So problem number two. How do you certify that a container
is actually bear resistant? Here at the Grizzly and Wolf
Discovery Center, they're trying to solve both those problems in one go. Rather than euthanizing a bear that's a
bit too interested in pick-a-nick baskets, it can get moved here, just outside
the park, where it might get a new job: testing containers. - On average, our bears test around
60 products per season, which runs from April 1st to October 1st. Without a doubt, coolers are number one. 30 to 40 coolers. Seems like everybody wants to make
a bear resistant cooler these days. So then we have the trash cans,
something you'd roll out to the end of your driveway. Some metal products even get tested here. We want those products to pass the test so
that out in the field a bear doesn't get that food reward and moves on, continues
back into the woods where they belong. Fish is their number one favorite. Peanut butter and honey is a close second. And then we either put dried
dog kibble or dog treats inside. Quite often we put a dummy container in, To give those bears a food reward
every once in a while. If they were to not be able to get into
a product, 20 products in a row. Why, perhaps, would they try
to get in that 21st time? So let them remember that there's a
lot of goodies inside, and they need to put that effort into trying to get in. - Definitely no bears
in here right now? - No bears. Lots of double checks, security,
radio calls. - So obviously, I asked to put a camera inside one of the
dummy trash cans,  one of the trash cans that the bears
would definitely get into. I didn't think the team here would
let me, but they said yes immediately. And in hindsight,
of course they said yes. The bears are literally being given a
load of plastic and metal to rip apart in the hope of reaching the food inside. A camera in a protective case is not going to make any difference to them. They're not going to eat it. They're smart enough not to. - The bear's favorite method, at least
with the trash can, we find, is the ""CPR method"", pushing
up and down with their paws, and a lot of times they
separate the lid from the body. With coolers, they're gonna use their
teeth to tear the plastic apart. And then the styrofoam,
and then the next layer, and then it's a clean-up on aisle four. - My big concern here was animal welfare. There is a centuries-long history of bears
being mistreated for entertainment, and I do not want to be part of that. This place has to survive as a non-profit,
and as a tourist attraction, but that can't mean putting
the bears' welfare at risk. Fortunately, the team here
are very clear that they don't want that to happen either. - We would never want to put
the bears at risk, for sure. These are all rescued bears
that came from the wild. We're very, very hands off. We don't call out to the bears. We don't talk to the bears. We want them to remain
as wild as possible. We also ask the public to
not call out to the bears. The bear habitat is about an acre in size. We do have two ponds, a waterfall,
and lots of trees and rocks and logs. We stock the pond with
fish all summer long. The food that's hidden out in the bear
habitat in front of the public is just an enrichment to keep them active. It's a snack. Let them do their natural behaviors
like they would in the wild. - It turns out that it's really
difficult to make a container that humans will want to use, and can use,
but that bears can't get into. Yesterday, I tried to use one of those
bear resistant trash cans, and it had been jammed shut by someone that
apparently couldn't figure it out, and just shoved their
garbage in the latch. Because, there's an old quote, allegedly
from some park ranger in the 1980s, I couldn't find the original source,
that says, there's a considerable overlap between the brainpower of
the most intelligent bears, and the least intelligent tourists. - 60 minutes of contact time. Quarter inch hole or larger is a fail. We always say ""bear resistant""
because we feel that if you give a bear an unlimited amount of time,
they'll get in most everything. Not ""bear proof"", no guarantees. Those bears are gonna come around and try
to get that easy meal each and every time. We're trying to educate the visitors to
not make the same mistakes that got most of our bears here
in the first place. More and more bears are staying
out of trouble in the wild. - Where's it gone? Oh yeah, no, that's a bear with a GoPro. That is a bear with a GoPro. Sadly, definitely not recording anymore. Oh, don't put it in the water. Don't... do not put the GoPro
in the water, bear. That's... And it's gone. That's... not ideal."
gisdyTBMNyQ,"There are quite a few rotating
buildings in the world, houses for people who want their
view to follow the sun. Maybe they're built as an
architect's dream house, maybe as an engineering challenge, or sometimes to give the
best angles for solar power. Over the years, I have asked to
film in a few of those houses, but I've always been turned down. They're private homes.
But this one, near San Diego, California,
is now on sale. The real estate agent
got in touch and asked if I wanted
to have a look around. To be clear,
this is not an advert. They're not paying me. But I just wasn't going
to turn this down. Because there are two things
I want to find out. First of all, how on earth
does the plumbing work? And second, if this is
someone's dream house, and it is, then why are they
selling it? - My wife and I decided we're
going to build a house. Just so happened, this lot went
on the market that same day. We happened to see the sign, we bought it. I'm trying to figure out
what to build. I said, you know,
why not a round house? That way, more rooms
will have more view. And my wife said, fine. Then I thought, some rooms still
have to look at the mountain. So I said,
why don't we rotate it? To my surprise,
she said, fine! And I thought, crap, I've got to
figure out how to do that! So I started to figure out
how to actually build something that would rotate, so
every room would have every view. - Yes, of course I asked if I could
flip the switch and control the rotation. - Go up to a thousand. Good. That's it. - It's very strange to push a button
and then have the world start to rotate around you.
- That's right! - That's lovely. - My wife and I started
construction in 2000. It took a good two years
to get to the point where we had a structure. We did hire some people and
had them working here, and I found that they would
go home at four o'clock and I would be here 'til seven
fixing what they had done, because they're used to building square
and this was round. The fella at San Diego County
would go over our plans and he says, ""I just
want to tell you, ""you're building something that's
way stronger than it needs to be. ""No way you can rotate that much
mass and and have it work."" So I said, ""do you care
if it rotates?"" He says, ""hell, I don't care
if it rotates"". And I said, ""well then can we
just agree to disagree ""and you let me go ahead
and build the damn thing?"" And he said ""all right"". In doing all the calculations, I came up with needing a
five-horsepower motor, so I put in
a five-horsepower motor. Have you ever driven your car
in fifth gear at 25mph? It goes like that, and that's
how the house was moving. Cut it down to a one-and-a-half
horsepower motor. It goes through a 25:1
reduction transmission, a 71:1 torque hub that drives
the two 16-inch diameter wheels. We can turn the
house in 45 minutes. You can go to bed to the sunset, and wake up to the sunrise
in the same bed. You have guests over, during dinner,
we'll turn the house so that everybody at the dinner table
gets to see the sunset. - In a lot of rotating buildings,
it's only part of the floor that rotates. the things that require plumbing,
like the kitchen and bathroom, don't move at all. But here, the sinks and toilets
and electrical sockets all rotate as part of the house, and all the explanations I can find
seem to hand-wave the details. They just say that there's a
central non-rotating core that handles the pipes. For electricity, there are
off-the-shelf components that can deal with rotation. - There's a thing called a slip ring. Which is a very standard
piece of equipment. Just like a merry-go-round. A merry-go-round goes around
and around and around, and it doesn't have to go backwards. Same thing here.
It happens to be a fancy one, 16 brushes that go around a
copper piece about that big, and they ride on the copper
and that is your connection. - For telephone and internet, there's
also an off-the-shelf component. A mercury slip ring, a sealed connector
with a small pool of mercury, conductive liquid metal,
in the center. Both sides can rotate. They just stay connected to the liquid. But that's not the difficult part. I can understand having one connection
going through the middle, for water or wastewater or gas. They can just sit on a
central pipe and swivel. But how can you have all three
going through the same central hub? The topology doesn't work.
They can't all occupy the exact center. But if they're offset,
then as the house rotates, surely the lengths of the pipes
and cables has to change? Or if there's slack, surely
they'll get twisted. Turns out Al has a very clever
solution to that. - Obviously you don't want to mix the gas, the gray water,
the sewer, the drinking water. So I designed a slip ring
for those services. Big piece of steel,
about that big around. This is fixed. We grooved it, it's about a 3"" by 3"" groove
all the way around. Top groove is sewer.
The next groove is gray water. The next groove is drinking water.
The bottom groove is gas. And there are holes drilled
through this from the sewer, from the gray water and so forth, They're all separate holes
that come out the bottom. Then there's a piece that
comes down the outside. This piece rotates with the house. You have a sewer line that comes down
and connects to the outer piece, and then you have gray water,
then you have drinking water, then you have gas. There are seals inbetween
each of these grooves. They're all alarmed. There's a seal, a sensor ring,
and a seal. A seal, a sensor ring,
and a seal, so forth for all of them. You would have to have two seals
and two sensors fail before you had any mixture of fluids The seals are good for 75 years, so I don't think we're gonna have a problem! - Yes, I had to commission
some graphics to explain this. It's really clever
and I did not understand it until Al explained it to me. It's like four intersecting funnels. - The total maintenance, once a year,
is to lube the bearings. We have a young man who has
done it several times. It's done in an hour. - Which brings me to the
other big question I had. After designing and constructing
this place, after 20 years of living here, why sell it? - I've had 18 heart procedures. My wife is in perfect health. The odds of me outliving her
are zero. She was born and raised in Coronado. We're moving back to Coronado. Because this is a complex house,
even though I think it's simple! For her to try and teach somebody else
how to run everything and do everything would be difficult
if something happened to me. So we're just kind of jumping ahead. And Coronado's a pretty nice place to go. - Will this place sell quickly? I don't know.
I'm not a real estate agent, but I certainly hope that
there'll be people who want to live somewhere
with this view in a home that's this different."
EN9JzxzDXU0,"We went with a lookalike
because there are actual replicas. People have built very close-to-scale
replicas of a 1911, 1910 Wright Flyer, but they found the same problems
the Wrights did. The airplane isn't exactly
what you call reliable. Very often, it crashed. And frankly, we don't want to have
to fix our airplane after every flight. We don't like the “crash” word. So we built out of modern materials
with modern building techniques, so that we could fly on a frequent basis. We'd like to be able to land the airplane
and put somebody else on it and continue flying. The airplane is very, very close to what
a 1911 Wright B Flyer would have looked like. Once you get 100, 200 feet away from it,
if we overfly people, a 1911 Wright Flyer is what you see. We're trying to recreate
what people in 1911 Dayton, Ohio, would have seen if Orville or Wilbur
had flown over top of them. And when you're inside the airplane,
this is not an open cockpit airplane. This is a no cockpit airplane. You are literally sitting in front of
the wing, and experiencing flight the way that people did
at the early turn of the century. The Wrights knew that in order to roll the airplane,
they had to change the lift of each wing. They literally just twisted the wings. The wood would bend inside the airplane. They had a small tray that they sat on,
and when they shifted their body, there were wires that were hooked
to the ends of the wing, and that would twist each wing
in opposite directions to be able to give them
that lift differential. The replicas that have flown
have done that. It's incredibly difficult
to be able to control. So to be able to get something
where you can safely and repeatedly do that
is very, very, very challenging. And that's why we went with the ailerons. The Wrights actually started out
as bicycle engineers, if you will. They were bicycle mechanics. So they were very familiar with chains. And when they realized
they could only have one engine, but they needed two propellers to generate the thrust that they needed
to overcome the weight, they very quickly realized a single chain
going to each propeller, one of them is inverted so that
you have counter-rotating propellers, was the way to do it. So we've done the same thing
on our airplane. We have one engine, and we have
two propellers that are driven by, frankly, a very, very,
very strong and very industrial chain. Yes, it looks like a bicycle chain,
but when you get up close to it, we've got a pretty solid chain
on this airplane for very good reasons. We have a Lycoming IO390,
probably the largest four cylinder general-aviation engine
that we could get to put on the airplane. So rated at 210 horsepower. The Wrights had anywhere
from 32 to around 40 horsepower, but sometimes you got a little less, sometimes you got a little more
because they were all hand-built. It actually flies much like any other conventional
general-aviation airplane, except for the fact that you're not sitting
inside of the airplane when you fly. You and I are both part
of the drag equation of this airplane. You are impacting the drag of the airplane
when you stick your hand out and wave. She's got a personality to her. And that's why we're required to go through the flight test process,
because the FAA knows the airplane is going to
have a personality. The FAA has a very rigorous process
when you're building even an experimental airplane. We loaded the wings down with salt bags
to simulate the load of 3½ Gs. So the airplane, we know can pull 3½ Gs. You're never going to see 3½ Gs
in this airplane. We've been up to
maybe 1.2 Gs in a 30° bank turn, and that's about as steep
as we're going to go, because we don't need
to do anything more than that. So maybe we overengineered the airplane. But, you know, to me, when I'm flying it, that's the kind of stuff I'm
really interested in having underneath me. We get a lot of head turning,
we get a lot of waves as we go by. We're trying to preserve
early aviation history. I've been airborne and I've looked down
and there's another airplane flying underneath of me. And that's just a view that you don't get
from many other airplanes. Our original airplane,
we call the Brown Bird. It first flew in 1982. It has flown over 5100 passengers
over the years. Really fun to fly. But we're going with something now
that's a little bit more advanced, a little bit easier to move around. A lot of people that have
come out over the years have said, “hey, I'm a pilot,
I've got years of experience. “I would really like to fly your airplane”. And we don't let other people
fly the airplane. And it's very difficult
to fly the airplane. We did make an exception once,
about 15 years ago. We took a look at his credentials
and we thought, okay, you know what? We're going to give this
gentleman a chance. And it was impressive
how well he could control the airplane. His name happened to be
Neil Armstrong. So we've told other people,
if you’ve walked on the moon, we’ll probably let you
come fly our airplane. But until then, you know,
we're just going to take you for a ride
when we take you flying."
rn_8GXNN7_Q,"Climbing frames like this, Americans call them jungle gyms, they used to be all over, in kids' playgrounds and schools around the world. These days, they've mostly been replaced by designs that are a little less geometric
and perhaps a little more safe. But this: this is the first one. Someone had to invent it. And that someone was called Sebastian Hinton. Technically, there was at least
one prototype before this one, but this was the first solidly-constructed,
modern climbing frame, the type that was sold under the
trademarked name of ""Jungle Gym"". It was installed at a school here
in Winnetka, near Chicago, in 1920, was used for 90 years, including being
relocated to another school, and it now sits here, in the
Winnetka Historical Society's back garden. I'm not allowed to climb up this,
by the way, partly because it's historic, and partly because I really don't think
my US medical insurance would cover someone in his thirties
falling off a jungle gym. Now, this was a pretty good
invention for the time. As the patent says, ""the facilities for climbing
available to the average child are limited, ""and generally speaking somewhat dangerous"". ""I have reduced--"" I don't know why I'm doing that voice! He was American in the early 20th century, he wouldn't have sounded like... ...""I have reduced the danger of climbing
to a minimum."" For 1920, he was probably right,
but he is optimistic. The patent mentions that you might
tie some ropes across the bottom to help catch a kid if they fall, or put fence wire round the outside, or even put it around
a swimming pool, but, ach, that's probably not needed. ""A child falling in the structure ""will have so many opportunities
to catch a bar or vertical ""that it is almost impossible that
he will fall through it to the ground."" The idea of a child slipping,
hitting their head, and then ragdolling down to the floor
doesn't seem to have occurred to him. But he does emphasise safety,
and that it must be constructed with the strength to handle
dozens of children swinging around on it together. He covered his bases. The text
of the patent expands to cover basically any arrangement
of perpendicular pipes. Like -- ow -- these. There's also a reference in there
to playing ""three dimensional tag"", and that's where the story
gets interesting for me. Because while Sebastian Hinton
patented this, he got the idea from his father,
mathematician Charles Hinton. Charles has an interesting biography. He was fascinated with the idea
of the fourth dimension. He wrote the first popular essay
on it in 1880, he invented the word
'tesseract' for a 4D cube, along with the words
'ana' and 'kata', as the 4D equivalent
of 'left' and 'right'. That was all Charles Hinton. Who also invented the first
baseball pitching machine... ...although it was powered by gunpowder
and reports differ on how well it worked
and how many injuries it caused. Charles was also convicted of bigamy for being married to two women
at the same time. Like I said, interesting biography. Anyway, according to Sebastian,
when he was growing up, his father Charles built what was
basically a jungle gym out of bamboo, a big structure of cubes like this. And Charles would get the children
to play a game: he'd call out mathematical co-ordinates
on the grid, something like ""X3 Y2 Z4!"", and the kids would have to race
to the first to get there. His logic was that humans mostly
walk around in two dimensions, but we can understand three. So perhaps if you can get kids to
move around three dimensions intuitively, while their brains are developing, they'd be able to understand four. Did it work? Well, not in that way,
the kids were much more interested with just playing around with it
as a climbing frame, and none of them apparently developed
any four-dimensional insight. But years later, the adult
Sebastian patented this. It's one of those inventions that
had to happen at some point: if not here, someone else would
have figured it out. But the size, shape, and design that
was in schoolyards around the world? That's down to Sebastian Hinton, his dad,
and an attempt to teach the fourth dimension."
72RxerDwzEo,"A few months ago, I got a message
from someone in Slovenia, telling me about the Cicka, a very strange and
very sketchy-looking manual cable car across
the river Sava. And I immediately wanted to
visit and film it. The problem is,
it's badly documented, and what there is,
isn't in English. So I hired a local production team,
who very quickly told me: it's been closed. Like most of the manual cable cars
in this part of the world, it wasn't being maintained,
and it was becoming unsafe. Fixing it up to modern standards
or replacing it would be far too expensive
just so a few hikers can use it. But one of the perks of
having local producers is that they can find things
that I really can't. Because not only did they
find a different cable car, one of the last still-working ones,
with a completely different and even sketchier design... they found the man who still
maintains it to this day. [IN SLOVENIAN:]
 
  Safety here,
like the sign says, is on your own
responsibility. This type of cable car goes back
to the first world war. The mountains here were part
of the frontline, and cable cars like this were
installed as makeshift bridges. But this one's from the 1950s, built after an old bridge
put up by the Italian army got washed out by a flood. And I know, this looks sketchy.
It sounds sketchy! It squeaks, it bounces,
it sways. But now I'm standing here,
it feels solid. I have no worries about this.
Except: if I draw attention here, could the
government suddenly decide ""well, actually, this is against
regulations"" and step in? Or could some local kids
decide to visit, and play around and break it, or
vandalise it? Or maybe get hurt? I've got a duty of care
to the places I visit. And this is something that the locals
are clearly very proud of. A couple of them used it while
we've been filming! Most of the manual cable cars
are gone now, and as far as I can tell, there's no definitive list
of those that remain. One day, they'll be history... but then, one day,
so will everything."
tMlHDnbEIDA,"I'm off script. Normally at this point, I am reading something that
I've written well in advance. When I get to a place to film,
there should be no surprises. But this was so far ahead of anything that I
imagined before coming here that I've had to throw out
every word I've written. So this is just me,
uh, vlogging, I guess? It's going to get edited together. I'm going to tell you the story of what may be the most
impressive home project I've ever seen in my life. So I put a call out last year
asking for interesting things in the world that people
were affiliated with that might show on this channel. And got a lot of suggestions in. And one of them was from
a couple of folks in Italy who had built a submarine simulator. Now, I've previously
filmed in a tank simulator from the 1970s in Germany. It's wonderfully analog. There's this big box that bounces along and this little model world
that this tank goes through. And it turns out they
had something similar for submarines, only with a
real, tiny submarine in a little tank. I'm like, that is great. That's going to make a brilliant story.
I'll go out. And I thought I knew what
I was getting myself into. Because it's going to be this
little remote operated vehicle, this little sub, that goes around a pond. And then they're going to
send video from that back to, like, a little controller
on a screen in a room. And, great. Lovely little video. So I get here and I'm
met by Marco and Danilo who are the two main people behind it. There's a whole team who've done all sorts
of things on this, but they take me in. And my first clue that this is more than I thought it was
is the startup sequence. This is built like it's some
sort of fancy escape room or maybe even a theme park attraction. But there is a
whole unlocking sequence where they boot up the submarine
that we're going to walk into, and there's a big wheel
that, clunk, unlocks. You pull open the pressure door,
you walk in, and I'll show you my reaction. It's a lot. - The badge on your left. - Oh, badge on my left. Slide. [computer voice] ""Welcome!"" - Oh, wow! This is incredible! - Close the door. ""Closing control room sector."" ""Mission confirm. Explorer."" ""Preliminary checklist."" - So right away, this
is not some little thing in the corner of a room. This is what set designers
would call a 360 experience? It doesn't matter where you look,
this is a submarine, as far as the people
in there are concerned. I sat in the wrong chair. The one at the front is for the captain, which is normally one of the team here, and the actual controls are in the back. So while I'm being blown away
by the startup sequence that they're going through,
that they know off by heart 'cause they designed it. Turns out, I should've actually
have been in the back there. So we swap seats, and we go
through the startup sequence. And it is this pre-rendered
computer graphic sequence where the submarine is miniaturized as if we were actually going
to be put into the real pond. Brilliant.
And then I realize something. The room is moving. - We are simulating something very slow,  so we don't need
the shaking power of the modern platform you can find. So we built our own with
that objective in mind. - So at this point, I've just got this
smile of joy on my face. 'Cause I'm just overwhelmed
at the scale of this, of something that feels
like a theme park attraction just sitting in an old 19th
century mill in rural Italy. And then the camera feed turns on. We are dropped into the pond. It's not like there's a drop. There's like a 'clunk'
from the hydraulics. The camera feed turns on, and there is the world in front of us. - Sure. - This is actually in the lake? - We are in. Definitely. This is the...
- Oh! - Left lateral. Right lateral. - But we're actually-
- Sliding. - There's actual movement here! So it starts out with Marco
and Danilo on the controls just showing me what to do,
and showing me a couple of interesting
things in the pond. But I start to pick up what's going on. I start to pick up how to use things. I go from just doing the rudder to actually starting to control
the depth a little bit and starting to control the tilt. It's got five degrees of freedom. So it will do tilt, it will do yaw, it will go forwards, backwards, left, right, and it'll go up and down.
Five degrees. And all of these are
controlled by separate things. And yes, the picture
quality is not spectacular. This is not a perfectly lit
4K HD camera on the front. But it's an actual camera. For a moment, I feel like
I'm controlling a submarine. It works. Because of
this gentle motion as we go. When it gets put into full throttle, we get pushed back in our seats a little. When we stop, we rock forward. And it's just...
it's really clever. It's really, really clever. So my plan is we'll have
a mosey round the pond. It'll be nice and gentle. And while that happens,
I'll ask them the questions about how, why. Yeah, I completely forgot.
Had to do that later. - You're seeing this in
complete the wrong order, by the way. I'm just telling the story as best I can. We continue exploring the pond
and we go hunting for life. But before we can do that,
there is an emergency on board. And look, I didn't know
this was going to happen! - ""Emergency!""
- What I should have done is hired a local production team and sent them into
recce in advance so I could be surprised by this, but the cameras would be
in the right position. I didn't know there was
going to be an emergency in the submarine and there
was going to be a whole other room that I would have to go into in order to try and fix the reactor core. But there was, I mean, spoilers,
if you're ever going to do this. But the scale of this, the
little detailed touches, the things that lit up,
just absolutely incredible. So finally, we go searching for life and there are a couple of newts
at the bottom of the pond. Because this is a natural pond. And they were very clear that they did not introduce the newts. You're not allowed to introduce the newts. They just built a very good pond, and the newts arrived on their own. This is real. This is not some Floridian
theme park adventure. This is an actual real little
submarine going round a pond. But that was the last surprise. Then they go and show me
what the actual submarine is. I was absolutely convinced
that it was a real submarine. And it's on... - It is.
- That's so clever. That's so clever. Because, of course, I assumed
it was going to be a little ROV. It was going to be a
little floating submarine like the one they showed
me the model of inside. It was going to be just a
miniaturized version of that with a camera on it and a cable. No, of course it wasn't. It's a big home-built X-Y-Z plotter, like a thing from a 3D printer. I don't know what the technical term is, but it's a huge rig they've built with a pan tilt zoom camera
and a Logitech webcam on it. This is all home brew. This is all made by them.
- Yeah. - This is a proof of concept, that the limited number of
people that could see this is because we are not always here
for showing that. - So if there's some science outreach fund in Italy out there who would like to build a version of this,
you are the people to talk to? - Yeah, sure. - This is never going to be
some mass-market public thing, not here. If you are hoping to have a go, you will probably be disappointed. Maybe if you're a local and you happen to be on
their website on the day when they say there's some
dates available, good luck. But this is not a thing meant for huge amounts of people
and the public. This is a proof of concept. This is a passion project. This is something that was built because they wanted to build it. And maybe, maybe there's a
version 2.0 that'll come in with some science foundation
funding or something like that. I don't know. I kind of hope so. I would love loads of
people to experience this. But at the same time, there
is something so charming about this wonderful thing that's just in the back
of an old mill in Italy. - ""Oxygen level low."" ""Return to base."" - Okay, okay, okay. - Go, go, go, go. Okay, now."
ar0klhiJfDI,"- I thought that scientists
understood how explosions work. Now, we're not going to
see big orange fireballs going up into the sky. I've done that before, I've
filmed with a pyrotechnician. We added a load of fuel to make the blast look
like a Hollywood explosion. But that is not realistic. Besides, these days
Hollywood, and scientists, can simulate those sort of effects
near-perfectly in a computer. I looked it up. There are industry standard
ways of predicting blast waves. They are very accurate...
once you're about half a meter away and there's clear air in between, which is good enough for most
people, 'cause let's face it, if you're five centimeters
away from an explosion, you've probably got bigger problems. But it turns out that's big picture stuff. Right at the start, in the detonation, in the first few instants of an explosion
as all that energy is released, that's where the simulations break down, and solving that problem could save lives. This bleak old World War II munitions site
is now a university test laboratory and the research is close up. So let's see a test. - Explosions are very
difficult to measure. We need something that's
going to be rugged and strong enough to survive an explosion, but we also need something
that's sensitive enough to measure things that are changing over millimeter length scales
and sub-microsecond timescales. The rig that we're going to
be using today is called MaCE, which stands for ""Mechanisms
and Characterization of Explosions"". It's a bit of world-leading kit where we can directly measure much closer
than anybody worldwide can do, gigapascals worth of pressures, and that's a very, very
complicated situation which we can't necessarily
model or predict currently. And we're going to use some
high speed video cameras to film what's going on as well. - If you hit a metal bar the right way, it'll make a ringing sound,
basically a musical note. That ringing is made by
the bar itself vibrating as the force from that initial hit bounces back and forth within the metal. And the pitch of that note
is really easy to measure. You just listen. The work the researchers are doing here is much more technical
and much more precise, but it's kind of the same process. - It's based on theory
by a British physicist called Bertram Hopkinson,
109 years ago, and it's only now that the
technology is catching up where we can affix
very, very small strain gauges and we've got data acquisition
systems that can sample it at the required rates and
required frequencies. The strain gauge is a tiny dot that we mount on the outside
of Hopkinson pressure bars, solid steel, one meter long,
four millimeter diameter. And we fix this strain gauge 40mm
from the loaded face of the bar, We sample it 5 million
times per second. We're going to set the explosive a little bit further
away from the surface, so hopefully we can see the fireball and the detonation
products start to expand. That's going to set up a blast wave that's going to propagate
through the bar as a stress wave. So the strain gauge records
a change in voltage. We can work out stress, which
we can work out the pressure and the load on the end of the bar from. And there's a whacking
great big steel plate that just acts as a shield
and just deflects everything away. So the pressure bars trap that pressure and send it downwards,
and then the arrangement of the MaCE rig that
we're building towards is 37 of these measurement locations. But today we've just got one!
Just to focus on what's happening right in the most severe part. - So I asked the researchers,
what's the use for this? Their first answer was, well, for science, and that's fair enough, but there are practical applications. To start with, if this works, building things that resist explosions
will become a lot easier and cheaper. - In the 80s and the 90s, the big challenge was big truck bombs
with tonnes of explosives. Nowadays, explosive attacks
are much more targeted. They tend to be smaller devices,
and as a result, they're located closer to the thing
that they want to damage. So that's why we've looked
in this very extreme near-field setting. We're going to be doing some tests today
with 100 grams of high explosive. It's around about tennis ball sized. There are a lot of secondary
reactions that go on. It takes a while to develop,
at least on our time scales, and there are ongoing chemical reactions. And that offers up the really
interesting prospect of, can we do something that's
going to mitigate them or even turn them off? Can we surround explosives in
a particular type of material to manage those reactions? Bombproof luggage containers
or storage containers on transport? That's a potential thing that could
be done with this research. - If we can understand
those first instants of an explosion, then maybe we can help
keep it under control. After all, this munitions
site is built to do that. It was designed to contain
anything that goes wrong by brute force, just using huge amounts of earth
and concrete bunkers. So can that be done with
less materials and less cost? We're about to take just one
step towards finding out. [horn blaring] - We've never been able
to observe these features before, so we kind of don't know
what we don't know. That's what the group looks at, uncovering what we don't
know about explosions yet. - All right, what have we got? - So this is filmed at about
a quarter of a million frames per second. - Wow, okay. Wow. You can see it bounce back! - So it hits the surface. And then as it goes back up,
see it reigniting. All that hot gas is
getting churned back up and it's mixing with the oxygen. And that's giving that secondary kick that we see at these
sorts of scale distances. It's continually pushing
the end of that bar and it's sending that information down - Because it's not one hit. It's a push that- It feels like one hit.
It feels like one hit. - Exactly. - But you are recording that so quickly that what you're actually
getting is a push. - Yep.
- Wow. - Cool, isn't it? - That's pretty cool."
xWL40q3DMoQ,"- This is test one. The Catesby Tunnel in
Northamptonshire, England used to be for trains. It was built by the Victorians in 1897, but fell into disrepair after
the line that went through it was closed in the '60s. It was abandoned for many years, but now it's a vehicle testing facility. You know a wind tunnel? This is a more realistic version of that where the air isn't moving,
but the car definitely is. - So Catesby Tunnel is
2.7km long. It's got a cross section of 42m²,
perfectly straight. It's quite an amazing feat considering the Victorians built it
without a laser level. Obviously the surface
of the earth is curved, but Catesby Tunnel is flat. So if you put a laser line along it, we're within 3mm of
being off that laser line. But when we first inquired about
repurposing Catesby Tunnel, it was totally derelict. They'd ripped up the track,
they'd taken away the ballast, they'd destroyed the drainage. So at the far end, the tunnel was actually
knee-deep in water. There were no facilities
or utilities here. There were bats living within the tunnel that we had to tread carefully around. So at the far end of the tunnel,
they've actually got their own ""bat hotel"". When we test outside, we've got the wind, we've got the rain,
we've got other vehicles, we've got lumps and bumps in the road. We want to remove those and
make this controlled a condition as possible so that the test is only seeing the changes
that we're looking for. - We're doing a ""coast-down test"" here. Julian got the car up to
130km/h, very quickly(!), and then he took
his foot off the accelerator and just let it coast in neutral. This tunnel's long enough
that there'll be a couple of minutes before he
has to touch the brakes. From that, you can work out
the drag and friction forces, which is really useful data
for car manufacturers. - Because Catesby Tunnel is a
bit different to a normal wind tunnel, we have to collect data on board. We can't use GPS, because we can't see the
satellites in the sky. The approach that we've come
to is an image-based system. - There's 1200 tags now in the tunnels and they are 5m apart,
and they've been surveyed to within a few millimeters,
each position. And then we measure the time it takes to go between each tag, and that's picked up by
this high speed camera that's working a hundred times a second. And that gives us a very high accuracy for speed of about a hundredth
of a kilometer an hour. The tunnel is a fantastic place
for this kind of measurement, because there is no extraneous sunlight and sunlight is very
difficult to cope with when you are working with infrared. - But I said that this was test one, and it was, I wasn't lying. But like any video about cars, you didn't see it from just one angle. There were camera shots
from all around the tunnel to get different angles
and keep it interesting. There were shots from
cameras that were attached to the car with suction cups for dynamic shots from
almost impossible angles. But this is a proper glossy car video. We don't want to see those
suction cup cameras from outside, and beside, we've only got two of them, and we don't want to
see the camera operator in the back either 'cause he's not there. There's got to be a little
bit of unreality to this that no one will notice once
it's all edited together. So when I said this is test one,
that is actually true. This right now is test one, but the shots from outside,
we haven't filmed them yet. We're going to have to go back and forth in this tunnel 15, 20 times before we've got every angle we need to make this look interesting. So I had a thought. Do those cameras actually
affect the results? If you've got a camera on
the outside of your car, how much more fuel are you actually using? How's that for timing? - Good timing. Spot on! - Typically, we go out and back for a test and average over both of those sections. We have a turntable at each end. The turntable takes about
20 seconds to turn around. We don't have access at
the far end of the tunnel, so we have to turn around inside. It saves doing an Austin Powers
37-point turn at the far end. - So exactly the same test the other way. - Yes. - Okay. Go for it. - In order to get the best accuracy, the driver has to be very consistent and he has to do the same thing
time after time. You have to drive in a very straight line. So any deviation, that
adds to the distance and the drag that the car's experiencing. You can start off at
pretty much any speed, as long as it's above the
start of your coast-down speed. You want to let the car settle a bit, because the moment you
put it into neutral, the car will start to rock backwards
and forwards a little bit, and all these little things all add up. - Is that a garage door opener? - It is.
- Just for the turntable? - Yeah.
- That's nice. - Smart. - I feel like this needs the music
from ""Thunderbirds."" - So the whole idea of Catesby Tunnel is to create constant
atmospheric conditions. We shut the doors at both ends and we seal the tunnel so that there's no wind coming through it. Because we're surrounded by earth, it actually means that the
temperature within the tunnel is within one or two
degrees all year round. We had the Aston Martin
Valkyrie in the tunnel, we've had cyclists in
here during drafting, which is fairly unique, something that you can't
do in other places. One of the biggest issues is what happens if there's
an accident in the tunnel and how do we get to them? So throughout every test,
we have a fire safety team on site. They're there to respond
if there is an accident. - There is a very slight
gradient to this tunnel and while I'm sure some
of the marketing team would be very happy if
it was perfectly flat, turns out there is a
little bit of an advantage to that gradient, because drag increases
with the square of speed, but friction increases linearly. So if you have one test
going very slightly downhill and one test going very slightly uphill, in theory you can
separate those two factors out from each other with a lot of maths that I do not understand. - The Catesby Tunnel surface
is an asphalt surface, typical of an A-road that
you would see outside, but just finished to as high
tolerance as we can get. - I do like how you stick to one side of the tunnel,
like it's a two-way road. - It just seems wrong barreling that fast down the center of a road. - Yeah. - And also, for consistency, for the aerodynamic wake. - Oh of course, it'll
be different depending on where you are in the tunnel. So I've been kept in the
dark for about 20 minutes now while you wrangle data. What do we have? - Well, this is an example of
one of the coast-down tests. The dark blue line is the speed. So that's us accelerating
rapidly up to 130, then pop it into neutral and
then coast down to about 40. - And then brake so you
don't hit the barrels. - And then brake so I
don't hit the barrels. - So we had four or five runs
with a clean car. - Yeah. - We had five, six runs with the GoPros in varying configurations. So we've got some sort of
drag from some sort of camera. - Yes, exactly.
- Alright. - And you can see, from 130
to 120 kilometers an hour, it took 7.04 that time and 7.03 that time. So a hundredth of a second difference.
- That's so close. - You wouldn't get that outside. - Yeah.
- It just wouldn't happen. And then with the GoPros on, from 130 to 120, took 6.98 and 6.97. Again, hundredth of a second difference. - Yep.
- Incredible. But there is a very noticeable difference between having a clean car and when you've got the
GoPros on the outside. It's measuring just a small difference
of about 0.8% between the two. - And does that map to fuel usage? - Yes.
- And this is not the most scientific test. We did a couple runs, the
GoPros were all over the place, but there is enough drag from them that you can measure it in there? - Yes.
- And there would be some effect on fuel. - Yes. Now of course, we were using
the ideal car for this test, because the weight doesn't
change from test to test. - Right, it's electric.
- Whereas, in a fossil fuel car, of course,
you've got to make sure that you don't let that tank go too empty. And there's lots of things
you have to take into account. - Yeah. So there's roughly 0.8%
more drag on the car from sticking a couple
of GoPros somewhere. - Yes, absolutely. - That's the closest I've got
to science in a long time. Thank you very much. - No problem. Thank you."
1v8u3ua6BPk,"- While I was researching this video, there was a brief moment where I thought, ""Actually, I might volunteer myself ""to get infected with some disease here."" It would make for great
""content""...! But unfortunately, spending a
couple of weeks in quarantine and taking a small, but genuine,
risk with my health wasn't something I could
reasonably afford to do. Fortunately, there are
people willing to do that, and some of them are inside here, in this former hotel in east London, taking part in a ""challenge trial"" for RSV,
a respiratory virus. So, with suitable precautions,
we're going to take a look. - What we're essentially doing is we are recruiting healthy volunteers, and we're deliberately
exposing them to a virus. We're giving them a virus that we know
they're going to recover from, but the idea is, by making them sick, we can then test if a
vaccine or an antiviral is efficacious at protecting
against that disease. We're not taking those
vulnerable populations which might become severely
ill with the viruses. They are healthy such
that we can recruit them, we can inoculate them with a virus, and they will be expected to
recover naturally on their own from the viruses that we're giving them. Half will get the placebo,
half will get the vaccine, and we'll typically come back
in about one month later, which is enough time to get
response to the vaccine, and then all of them will be exposed to the challenge virus. Pharmaceutical companies,
before they come to us, they would've tested to make sure that that vaccine or antiviral
is safe in humans first but without the disease. Then, they're ready to do
human viral challenge studies, which we then bring the next element,
which is the disease itself. So recruiting a volunteer and
making sure they're suitable for the trial really does
fit into two categories. One is, are they healthy
enough in their body, you know, their heart, their lungs? Are they functioning
normally and truly healthy from a medical perspective? Similarly, they are
going to be quarantined for up to two weeks at a time. So we want them to be
happy in that environment and able to cope in that environment. So both their bodily and
their mental health capacity is both vital. - This is what a quarantine
room looks like from the inside. Not in use right now, obviously, and it will be fully deep-cleaned
again after I leave! But yeah, this will be someone's
home for a couple of weeks while they're being paid
to risk their health. Any viral infection, flu, COVID, whatever, does carry a risk of long-term effects, and there are serious ethical questions about whether it is right to pay someone
to risk their health. But to be fair, there are
much more difficult jobs that also involve physical risk
and the chance of bodily injury ...and that usually
don't involve sitting in a room with a TV and a PlayStation. - So the volunteers
who come onto the trial actually are compensated for their time, and it's important that
we phrase it like that. That would typically be
£4,000-4,500, would be the typical amount. That's set in conjunction with
the research ethics committee to make sure people on
our trials are compensated for their time similarly to
any other trial in the UK. - You are exactly two
stories below me right now. We're obviously not
allowed to talk in-person. How are you feeling? - So not everybody will become
infected on these studies, so yes, some of them
will feel completely well for the entire time. And that's expected. What we're trying to do, of course, is to give the minimum amount of virus to cause a reproducible amount of disease. The outcome of that normally is, that means not 100% of
people will be infected, but a high percentage will be infected. - There are quite a few
organizations around the world who run similar trials. This one is descended from the
UK government's Common Cold Unit, which started just after
the Second World War and ran experiments for
nearly half a century. They didn't cure the
common cold, obviously, but they did identify what
we now call... coronaviruses. Back then, they'd run
adverts in newspapers offering ""ten days' free holiday""
""and travel expenses paid"", the catch being, of course, that you would be in
quarantine and infected with something during that holiday. These days, the advertising
is a bit more straightforward. - There was one part of challenge trials that it took me awhile to figure out. Somewhere, they have to
manufacture the viruses that they're infecting volunteers with to specific standards
of quantity and quality, the same as you would for
any other scientific supply. So how do you make and transport
things like the common cold? - It would start by taking a clinical swab from someone who has contracted
the disease naturally, in the community. Then that swab is then
grown in tissue culture and amplified up, all done under
very controlled conditions. Now, this process of producing
human challenge virus is actually really similar to the way
a lot of vaccines are made. You need to grow up the virus first, and then you inactivate the virus
or you denature the virus in some way and that becomes the vaccine. So that early part of the pathway
in producing a vaccine is very, very similar, actually, to how we produce challenge viruses. - I get to leave here now. I'm not one of the volunteers. They've got days or weeks
left in one of these rooms, depending on which trial they're in. But I did have one more
question before I went. Does this actually work? - We've seen a lot of drugs
and vaccines accelerated through the work that we've done. Challenge studies,
they're being used really to understand very early on,
have I got a proof of concept? Can I see if my drug is working and
give me confidence to take it forward? Or the reverse, can I kill it quickly? And then they can put their
money into other better drugs, or redevelop it."
b5Oy29TEVOE,"- Since 1967, CEA-Leti, here in Grenoble,
in the south-east of France, has been one of the world's
largest research hubs for electronics and nanotechnology. And by the mid-2000s, the
folks here had a problem. They had two clean rooms, two carefully controlled
spaces with purified air where research and testing could be done without any dust or
contaminants getting in the way. But those two clean rooms
were 250 meters apart on opposite sides of a road, which is the kind of thing that happens when your campus steadily
grows over decades. So every time some tiny
component or piece of equipment needed to be moved from one to the other, it had to be put in sterile packaging. Then, the researchers would
have to leave the clean room, take off all their gowns, and
gloves, and shoe covers, walk over, put on a whole
new set of protective gear, clean off the packaging, and then finally go in and unpack it. And you can see the solution. They built the world's
cleanest people mover, a clean room on wheels that can somehow dock and
undock to the main buildings without letting any outside air in. And we're going for a ride. - The clean room is about 11,000m². Today at Leti, we have
about 2,000 employees, and 800 of them are
focusing on fabrication. We are making devices,
from components to sensors, and we are mixing a wide
variety of technologies, including lasers, quantum technologies. We are able to print circuits down to the 10-nanometer nodes. This is a device that you
will find in your phone or in drones and specific systems. To speak about the dimension, we said that the thickness of
one hair is about 50 micron. So when we discuss a transistor
with a dimension of 10 nanometers, it's about 5,000 times
smaller than the hair. And the risk is that when one hair
is dropping on the surface, that, of course, the
circuit won't operate. - All of the horrible human stuff is sealed inside many layers. Let's go ride a people mover. - We have to operate in a
very clean environment since the source of contamination is us. So basically, we have
to wear special clothes to protect the wafers, and
the dies, and the circuits, and the nanotransistors from us. - Obvious question, why
not just build a corridor? Well, they did think about it, but that's a colossal amount of space that would have to be
filled with ventilation and air treatment equipment
all the way along, all constantly running and
maintained at huge expense. Also, they were worried
about how people would feel walking down an isolated,
empty, narrow, sealed-in 250-meter corridor
with no doors where you can't see the other end because it needs steps in the
middle to get over the road. Not great. [sliding door clicking] Oh, there's the buttons! Someone should probably join me in here! - How clean is the clean room? I would say compared to the hospital
and the surgical theater, the surgical theater
has probably 100 times more particles in the air. And I would say that the house has probably 1 million times
more particles in the air. We can see these bigger gray pipes,
and this is the way that we are operating the
recirculation of the air from the top to the basement
through the clean rooms. - I should point out, there's three or four people
crowded behind the camera here. I'm not being allowed in the
clean room funicular on my own. Here we go. And this is a clean room. The air is still being circulated just as it was in each of the buildings. The concrete supports
that we're traveling over, and all the powered systems that are hauling the cables
that are moving us are, well, they're not off the shelf, but they are about as
standard as you can get for something like this. They're manufactured by
a company called Poma who make all sorts of ropeways. For this clean room that sits on the top, well, making this work was
up to the folks from the CEA. - So in the clean room,
we have a special team, which take care of the
cleaning of the surfaces and make sure that no particles are stuck. We have to clean the shuttle as well. So the cleaning team is also
operating within the shuttle. - The problem is that this has to dock and undock from the clean rooms. How does dust and outside
air not get inside? The cabin slows down a
lot at the end of its run, and that's because it
has to position itself extremely carefully, millimeter-accurate, to make sure the rubber seal on this door matches up with the rubber seal on the door of the clean room. They get connected. And then high-pressure air
blasts out anything in between. All the outside atmosphere is
exhausted by fresh, clean air. And this whole system, the
people mover and the clean room, is kept at slightly higher
pressure than the outside. So if there ever is a leak, it's
only going to leak outwards. - When you enter the shuttle,
the door will close and then you have to
wait for maybe 30 seconds before there is a higher pressure inside. And then at the end, we
have the same operation. It's to depressurize the shuttle
to allow the door to open and the operator to move in
the next clean room facility. - So why not just let
people keep walking over the old-fashioned way? Well, before this was installed,
the researchers here estimated that transporting stuff
between the two rooms was so inefficient that it
lost the time equivalent of seven or eight full-time jobs. And rebuilding the clean rooms
would cost far, far more. This might seem a bit
unnecessary at first, but out of everything, it's probably the least expensive option. And I am not allowed through this door. I can't do the walk off into the distance! I'm not allowed through this,
my badge doesn't let me. We go back! Let's go back."
evV05QeSjAw,"- For almost a century,
it was accepted that the holes in Swiss cheese
came from carbon dioxide, produced by the fermentation bacteria that convert milk to cheese, and that just sort of...
happened automatically. That's written in countless articles. It's what's all over the internet,
and it's almost true. About 30 years ago, Swiss cheese
makers started to notice that the holes, the technical term is eyes, were getting smaller and less frequent, and scientists wanted to work out why. Specifically, the scientists
here at Agroscope, a Swiss government-backed
agricultural research facility, where, for science, they have
a lot of samples of cheese, and, more importantly, samples
of the bacteria that make it. - It's skim milk, and about
one to five billion cells of lactic acid bacteria per milliliter. They have a shelf life
of about 10 to 14 days, so all year round, every week, the cultures are freshly made
and sent to our customers. We are a research station. We have our collection of strains, but we are also a producer
for these cultures. We have the genomes of
almost all the bacteria that we have in the collection here, and we know what parts of the genome are responsible for some
effects on the cheese. - From the beginning of the 20th century, microbiologists went
to the different dairies all over Switzerland and took the cheese
and different products, like whey or the natural whey cultures, and isolated bacteria from there. At that time, each cheese dairy had its own culture to
produce its own cheese, and each one of these
cultures was the result of decades or centuries of
evolution, of selection. Many of these dairies had to close down or they switched to the
commercial starter cultures, and these bacteria that
made up the cultures would have disappeared if
they hadn't been collected. So, the collection still expands. We have around 15,000 isolates. All of the strains of our collection are frozen at -80°, and for
the most important ones, we also freeze-dry them. Each strain that we store here
has a backup on another site. - So, each cheese has its
own unique bacterial culture stored in the archive back there and regularly produced
in these bioreactors. The difference between
Emmental and Gruyère is partly to do with technique, but it's also the bacteria that make it, and those bacteria are valuable. - All the bacteria that we
have here in the collection are owned by the Swiss dairy industry to have a competitive advantage. Our bacteria are not
better than other bacteria, but they're very regional, very special. - Some of the cheese types
are legally protected, and to do that, they have to
use some special bacteria. We call them marker bacteria, because they bear a very
specific sequence of DNA that we are able to detect in the cheese during the production, but also at the end of the ripening, and by detecting this small piece of DNA, we are able to say, ""Okay,
this is the right cheese."" - It turns out that
cheese fraud is a thing. There's a market for
fake, cheap Swiss cheese, and in everyday English,
particularly in North America, there's also no distinction
between Swiss-type cheese and the specific Swiss cheeses that are made here near the
Alps, the ones that have legal protected status
marked on the packaging. So, Swiss dairies can work
with the researchers here, they can order the bacterial
cultures, or just get advice, but it is strictly just for
the industry in Switzerland. There are trade secrets here
that are guarded carefully, and which I was not allowed
to even see, let alone film. - We regularly develop new cultures together with the cheese industry, but because you have always to wait the ripening time for the cheeses, it takes always several years
to develop a new culture. - So, a few years ago, the team here had to answer the question, why aren't there holes
in the cheese anymore? - We produce here the cheese, but then they go down to the cellar. Most of the cheeses have to age between 3 months and 12 months. At several time points, we take samples to analyze them in the laboratory. For the analysis of the holes, we use X-ray and we use
also computer tomography, so then we really can count the holes, but we also see the
distribution in the cheese. - The bacteria that are
responsible for making these holes produce propionate,
acetate, and carbon dioxide, and this carbon dioxide
is produced in the cheese and aggregates all around impurities. The more the bacterium
produces this carbon dioxide, it accumulates and builds these holes. These impurities capture
the carbon dioxide and then a bubble forms and grows. - They found that the milk was too clean, so we didn't have any dust in it, and this was because we
had closed milking systems so the dust could not get into the milk. - Everything improved the last decade. So, the milking process is
hermetically closed now, and in former times, in the barn, you had always this hay dust everywhere, and it came also into the milk. - We tried different
particles to put into the milk to see if the holes are growing again. Hay powder is the best one,
and we really could see that the hole formation was dependent on the concentration of the
hay powder we put in it. It's only one milligram
per thousand liters. - Modern food safety standards mean that milk is far cleaner now than
it ever was in the past, without the tiny...
well, these days, it's ""imperfections"". In the past, it would
have been contaminants, but, without those, if the
milk is perfectly clean, the holes just don't form, and while those holes don't
really affect the taste, they certainly affect whether Swiss cheese
looks like Swiss cheese."
KRIBVykhpC4,"- Depending on which science
fiction you want to reference, the researchers here at the
University of Konstanz in Germany have either built a
holodeck from ""Star Trek,"" or ""The Matrix,"" or something kind of like
the old alien abductions from ""The X-Files."" It's just that they've
built it for locusts. - One of the great challenges
in studying collective behavior is that there's this intricate
network of interactions among the individuals that
we can't see, we can't control. And so, it's really
difficult to understand how these locusts, with
their local interactions, can scale up to swarms that can extend across
hundreds of square kilometers. We thought, ""What if we
could have individuals ""moving and interacting
with virtual swarms?"" And so, that's why we've
designed this setup. What we do is we put the animal on this large, motion-compensating sphere. As the animal moves, the sphere always moves to keep it on top and so, it can move in a
never-ending desert environment. And by tracking that movement, we know where the animal's gone. The locusts believe
these virtual individuals to be other locusts. They will tend to align
their direction of travel with near individuals. They will think of themselves
as being within a real swarm. - Locusts don't have depth perception
in the way that humans do. Prey animals generally have
eyes on each side of their head, trading off 3D vision for
a much wider field of view. So there's no need for
sci-fi holographic systems or tiny little 3D glasses here. As long as they keep an exact track
on the locust's eye position and update the screen fast enough, it seems to fool them. I'll be honest, I do find
this a little bit unsettling... ...and it's only going to get
more unsettling from here. - Ultimately, decision-making is made
in the brain of the animal. So if we're to understand
these vast swarms, we actually need to go in and look at how the brain
processes this information. So in this VR, we're basically plugging
into the spinal cord. The animal here is tethered. It has to be held in place
but can still walk freely on a ball that's elevated by air,
so it doesn't have friction, allowing the locust, again, to move and interact with a virtual swarm. So, we know what the
animal's responding to but now we can also
decode the neural signals that are underlying the
decisions it's making. So, locusts impact the livelihood of 1 in 10 people on the
planet through food shortage. They contribute to humanitarian
crises across the globe, yet no one understood
why they form swarms. - So, the researchers here
have also commissioned this massive imaging hangar and they're going to track
thousands of locusts individually by attaching tiny
retroreflective tags to each one and using a motion-capture
system with more than 30 cameras. Sub-millimeter precision,
100 frames a second. Again, I had questions, starting with: where do you
order thousands of locusts from? - Well, luckily for us, it turns out that
entomophagy or eating insects is becoming an important
aspect for humans and also for agriculture,
for farm animals, so there are actually huge
locust breeding centers. We collaborate with them and so,
they bred the insects for us. We have a whole team of
experienced individuals(!) from senior professors to
undergraduate students, all working together, gluing these little
tags on the individuals. And this allows us to see the
three-dimensional information much, much more easily than we could using
many video cameras. The imaging hangar is
15 by 15 by 8 meters. It's designed to mimic the environment
in which locusts have evolved. We have extremely bright lights that capture the natural wavelength
of light that they experience. We have the correct temperature of
around 27, 28°C within this large space. So first, we're looking at the locusts
in different densities to see which different
structures and patterns form, but then, we also want to understand how these voracious insects
eat their way through crops. And also, how they avoid
predators when doing so, so we're also startling the individuals to see how social behavior also influences their
response to predators. When the insects hatch,
they're flightless. In fact, they're flightless for the
first two months of their lives. It's only in the final adult stage
that they take to the wing. And so, the critical stage for understanding the swarms
and also controlling them is these flightless juveniles. - And this is about 10,000 locusts. There are questions about
testing on insects, of course, but the consensus right
now is that... they're insects. And as long as there's
no unnecessary harm caused, the trade-off is well worth it. These would've been ground up
for animal feed, after all, and the world doesn't have
a problem with that. And locust swarms aren't cooperative. Researchers have discovered
that locusts march in formation because traveling in the
same direction at the same speed is the easiest way for each individual
to avoid being eaten by other locusts. If humans can understand
this swarm's behavior, maybe we can start to understand
the gigantic, devastating swarms with billions or even trillions
of locusts, the ones that destroy food supplies. Or maybe we can start to
improve the forecasting tools, because right now, the
only methods the world has to deal with devastating
locust plagues are vast amounts of
industrial pesticides... and hope. - I find it astonishing that
there are pest insects that impact so many
people on the planet, and yet there's so little
research into this. And one of the main reasons is that the people that really are
impacted by locusts, they're subsistence farmers. They can't afford agrochemicals. You also have countries where they've got other
problems to deal with, such as internal strife and conflicts. The last experiments
we did with locusts, when I was based in Oxford, we had, I think, the most
was 110 individuals. To approximate what
they're doing in nature, we need to start looking at
tens of thousands of individuals. The key here is that we need these very
large-scale experiments to be that bridge between
the lab and the wild. One of the amazing things about locusts is that the swarms just
suddenly appear out of nowhere. And so, what we're trying to mimic here is:
as population density increases, we think that these swarms
will suddenly emerge. They'll suddenly start
marching together in unison. We're just beginning to understand
the wonders of collectives, how groups of neurons
communicate with each other to allow animals to make decisions, and then, how social interactions
connect brains together such as in locust swarms. So, we think locusts can
sense the environment through this communication
within the swarm. This gives them a
swarm intelligence that's beyond the brain
of any individual. We can use this to
begin to understand how and why these swarms form
and therefore, how we can best minimize
the impact on humans. - It's a couple of hours later. The imaging hangar
has been blocked off from all humans
for a while, and the researchers here are
now seeing marching behavior that has never been
observed in the lab before. It's only ever been in the wild. It's working, and they've come up
with like a dozen ideas for new experiments in
the last 10 minutes. This is brilliant."
4ZX9T0kWb4Y,"When I was a kid, magnetic levitation trains,
maglevs, were going to be the future. Television shows would film
breathless reports on the latest trials in Germany,
or here in Japan, promising unbelievably fast and smooth travel
between faraway cities. But decades later, the only actual
high-speed maglev service in the world is in Shanghai, China. Which is fast, but it's almost a gimmick. It only goes 30km. It loses enormous amounts of money
every year. Not many people use it. I thought that maglev
was one of those technologies like Concorde, that we thought
with the future until they weren't, and now there’s just abandoned test tracks
and the dreams of the past. Which is why I was very surprised
when my local producer here in Japan asked me if I wanted to take a ride
on the new maglev. Because it turns out
Japan has had a test track for years. It carries passengers,
because every so often they will open their tests to the public,
with a lottery for tickets. And this test track is already longer
than the entire Shanghai maglev system. The plan is that it'll be part of a
285km route, taking 40 minutes, which is less than half the time
of even the bullet train, with a cruising speed just over 500km/h. 90% of that track will be in tunnels,
and that's under construction now. Forgive me for getting excited, but the future appears to be arriving,
and I'm going to take a ride on it. But first, the team here said
they'd let me stand by the track, as the maglev goes past, at speed. And that's the maglev. Wow. So it's going to accelerate and then they’re going to bring it back,
at full speed, into that tunnel, 500 km/h. That accelerates so quickly. I don't know if that comes
across on camera, but a normal train would have started so much slower
than that. It's already doing,
what, 30, 40 km/h in a few seconds? That would have pushed
you back in your seat. Wow. Okay. Now we wait for it to come that way. Won’t lie... little bit nervous. I know I'm safe, but there's a reason I'm
not allowed behind this line. It's about maybe a kilometer to that tunnel mouth, maybe a little less. And the train's now coming towards us. 500 km/h, which means it's going
about 1km every 8 seconds. It's nearly here. Apparently. They've just told me it's nearly
here, and I can't hear a thing. Oh, I can see a light. I can see the train coming.
I can see headlights. All right, how fast is 500 km/h? I hope that came across on camera. ‘Cos you hear nothing,
and it looks so far away, and it looks so unthreatening. And then it is there
and this wall of sound hits you. That's incredible. I don't have words. It's my job to have words for a moment
like this, and I don't! All right. It's going to come to a stop. I'm going to get on it. We're going to ride at 500 km/h. It smells new. There’s new plastics
and fabrics in the air. Okay. Here we go. The acceleration is noticeable. Like, I got pushed back in my seat there, in a way that I think
I've only felt on planes. It's not full-plane-takeoff,
but it's still way stronger than anything that I’ve felt in a train
anywhere else. We're already approaching 100 km/h. That is... 100, and we’re still
acclerating. 130. So the wheels are going to come up soon,
we're going to hit 150 km/h, the wheels are going to come up... And the noise goes away, and it's so much smoother. 200 km/h. And we're still accelerating. The only reference I've got now
is the big screen, which is just counting down
how long until the end of the track. It's a little bit bouncy, but nothing
you wouldn't expect on a regular train. Okay. 300 km/h. We're at 'continental Europe high speed train'
now, and we're still accelerating. I'm still being pushed back in my seat. Not dramatically,
but it's still noticeable. I've never experienced
this much acceleration for this long. And we're still going. 480. 490. And we ease off the acceleration. That's 500 km/h. That's the fastest I've ever
traveled on land. And it feels... like a train! It is a little bit louder
than you'd expect from a train, but it's way less than an aircraft. You can still have a conversation, there’s a bit of noise in the background,
but it's still doing okay. But there's nothing uncomfortable about this.
I was worried that at this speed I was going to feel like
I was being jolted about. But this... this feels like a train! So will it work this time? Because there is a long history
of breathless British people traveling to other countries
and getting excited about maglevs and telling the English-speaking world
about the future that never comes. This feels like a video that the BBC
could have filmed in the 70s or 80s. And the original opening date of 2027
has already been pushed back, the new date is still uncertain. One local government keeps raising
objections to the construction. The future is not here yet,
and we're not going be seeing one of these in Europe
any time soon. But the track is being built. The technology does work. And it looks like the economics are sound, because there's clearly demand
for traveling between two major cities. In a few years’ time,
we might finally get to ride the maglev that the world was promised
all those years ago. We are braking now
and it is still really strong. One last thing. They stopped the train
in the middle of a curve. When I was coming through this at
500 km/h, it felt perfectly level to me. I felt nothing weird,
but it turns out that actually... the whole train is tilted ten degrees! I'm having to brace myself
to stop sliding down the carpet. Thank you very much to everyone from JR,
who’s standing behind the camera there. This was a privilege.
Thank you very, very much."
voYdl7IFZsM,"There are a lot of obvious questions
about an automated bicycle storage park. Like... why? It's cool. It feels like the future. And importantly for this video, I'm able to attach my GoPro cameras
to the bike to get some shots
of how it all works from the inside. But when the alternative for bicycle
parking is relatively cheap metal tubes
concreted into the ground, well, why would you build something with lots of moving parts
that's way more complicated and expensive? Well, if space is really, really limited,
like here in Shinagawa, in Tokyo, this can be a reasonable solution. Without the need for human access, you can fit way more bikes
in the same footprint, closer together and stacked vertically. No one wants to walk their bike up
or down a ten-storey underground ramp, but the elevator does
the work for you here. The bikes also are safe
from theft or damage. This one above-ground building can store
up to 200 bicycles in the vaults below it. So that was going to be the video. I was going to interview
someone about this. But the company who builds these
said, well, you know we do these for cars
as well, right? Different scale, same principle. And yes, of course, I'm going to attach
GoPros to this car as well, except this time, I'm
going to be watching from underground. I'm going to try and get
this piece to camera while the heavy equipment
is moving behind me. I've been given a very specific safety
position to stand in. This is not a space designed for humans,
the lights aren't usually on down here, so wish me luck with this. There are the same benefits here
as the cycle park. Yes, you've still got to have some space for cars, but they can park closer together. There's no need for as much headroom. And there's no need for the space for
everyone to maneuver around each other. So they can park almost twice as many cars
in the same space. ...that is terrifying! And on the surface,
there is just the one building. When you've got land available, yes, something with no moving
parts will be much easier and cheaper. Or, y’know, good public transit. But in the absence of those, there are places
where this could be useful. I wasn't quite sure this was enough
for a video on its own, though. But then the team here told me
about the version of this they’ve built that parks electric cars, and
lets them charge while they're in storage. And I was like, how have you done that? Arigato gozaimasu. Okay. Here we go. Because charging a car requires
human intervention. At some point you've got to
plug the car into a charger. So once the car's in position here, how is that charging hookup handled
safely, without human intervention? I thought maybe robotic arms
plugging in chargers. Tesla were teasing that many years ago
and obviously never delivered. But the answer is much simpler,
and I reckon, much more clever. You plug the car into the platform
you're parking on. And that platform has a heavy duty, rugged
connector that can link it to the mains. This is their demonstration model,
built above ground, but there's no reason
it couldn't be hidden underground. This company's main business
is construction equipment, after all. Now, for this version, it's just
one model of small car designed to run around
the local area. It's not a high speed charger. But in theory, this could be scaled up. Modern charges aren't like old plug
sockets, there’s computers negotiating each link
and making sure it's stable. So it's not like there's
a big spark on disconnection. I wouldn't expect parking lots
like everywhere, but in a few cities where space is at a premium,
it could be an option. Personally, I'm just looking forward
to seeing the footage from those GoPros."
_8W2LIfl5RE,"This story ended up being
more complicated than I thought. It is generally accepted that
the oldest business in the world, the oldest that’s
still operating, anyway, is the Nishiyama Onsen Keiunkan. Which is this hot-springs hotel,
about three hours west of Tokyo. For one thousand three hundred years,
people have been coming here for the natural, crystal-clear
hot water baths, and until recently, the owners have
52 generations of the same family. There are other people staying
here tonight, by the way, it’s just we’re not filming them
for obvious privacy reasons. The hotel's not empty. Anyway, I assumed that
I'd be staying in something like a
living museum here, because that's what
I've come to expect from the sort of historical attractions
you'll find in Britain. That's what tends to happen to anything centuries old
where I'm from: a kind of preservation that means
that everything must be held at a certain point in time, funded by tourists who want to
visit the old thing and see history. Which is great if you're
running a museum, but for a hotel business that needs
to survive in the 21st century: well, customers will change
with the times. There’s still tradition here.
It's not a Western-style hotel. You sleep on futons, dinner is served
at a low Japanese-style table. But this place has been updated,
again and again and again, this building is only
a few decades old, the exact location has moved
around this area many times over the years. It’s only been a hotel in the
English sense for a few decades, before that it was just a place
to stay and take the waters. Now, there's very fast wifi and,
of course, a gift shop. They excavated new
hot springs in 2005, which gave them five times
as much hot water, and there are modern pumps and systems
to check water temperature and quality. The water's drinkable, by the way. It's a hot spring after all,
it’s mineral water. So that was going to be the story. This is the world's oldest business,
because it changes with the times. Problem one with that: the modern English-language
concept of ""business"" doesn't quite map correctly onto Japanese culture from more
than a millennium ago. Obviously. There is a school of flower arrangement
in Kyoto called Ikenobō, that was founded a couple
of centuries before this. But that school
probably counts as an ""organisation"" in English,
rather than “business”, as best as I can tell from
translations and my local team here. If you do count that school, you kind of have count much older
like the Catholic Church as well! This has always been
a definite business. So problem two: this has only been the oldest business
in the world since 2006, when the former record holder,
a construction company called Kongo Gumi, fell on hard times. But Kongo Gumi didn't close
or go bankrupt... it was bought by a bigger
construction company. It had been a family business
for nearly 1500 years, but now it's just a subsidiary
of a modern company, still operating but arguably just
a name on an organisation chart. Should Kongu Gumi still count?
I don't think so, but... if it doesn't count, that brings me to problem three
with this story, which all the English-speaking sources
I found seem to have missed. There was no practical change
to what was happening here, that seems more like a
restructure than a takeover? The new owner is the
old general manager, so while it’s not in the family,
there is continuity. And I hate to say ""I'm not sure"", but if there's been one theme
through this channel over the years I've
been making videos, it's that the world
is complicated and it doesn't fit in
neat little categories. If you've got a list like
""oldest businesses"" that's a millennium
and a half old... of course it's going to
have a few asterisks on it. As for me... I'm just going to go
and take the waters."

of New Zealand, is a city built on steep hills. If you're a tourist,
you will probably stop by the Wellington Cable Car
at some point, which will pull you up from
the main shopping street to the Botanic Gardens. But if you're local, there
are more than a hundred other cable cars in the city and they are definitely
not for tourists. - I purchased this house

the previous owner had some mobility issues,
and that's why she installed it. And I've been living
in this cable car house for about two years. - Access Automation has
installed approximately 300 cable cars around New Zealand. Majority of those will be in Wellington

all around New Zealand and all around the
Asia-Pacific for that matter. They've got lots of different names, hillside lift, incline lift, probably a more accurate description. The Australians call them inclinators,
which is a pretty cool name. - This isn't just about laziness or having something swish
to raise your property prices. There are quite a few houses in this city that are up on hills and only accessible by long flights of stairs
or twisting, winding pathways, tucked behind other buildings
with no direct road. There are even some cable cars that give access to several
different houses along one track. - Our larger cable cars are
for commercial installations, for hotels and resorts. We're looking at 800kg,
10 passengers, up to 200 meters in length. And some of them go on
almost vertical cliff faces. They're really spectacular. A typical small residential cable car
would carry two people, might run 15-20 meters, be ideal for a retired couple
or just to get access to the home. We still get a lot of
inquiries for new cable cars. A common inquiry is for
people wanting to develop the back of their section. In the old days, they would
tend to build the houses close to the access point to the road, but with the cable car,
it gives the option of opening up rear sections. There's road access to the front lot, but if you've got a
30 or 40° gradient hill, it's not practical for people to walk up 40 or 50 meters up a gradient like that. So that's where the cable
car comes into its own. The bar for safety's always going up. And that's one of our challenges, is to meet the very high
requirements for safety without making them unaffordable. A small installation, you'd
probably be starting around 200,000 New Zealand
dollars these days. There's significant investment. - So if you've got to
regularly lug bags of shopping or anything else heavy
up 20 meters of stairs, or if you're older and
worrying that mobility issues might mean you have to leave your home, and you've got the money
to install one of these, it is actually a reasonable approach. But cable cars like this aren't cheap. And like any other elevator, they have to be regularly
inspected and certified. - Yeah, it was interesting moving in and,
never having owned a house before, and suddenly the house
needs a warrant of fitness? Which is something that
I'd never thought about! It's something I've only
associated with cars in the past. - So cable cars are covered
by the Building Act. They're actually
considered to be buildings. They require an annual
warrant of fitness, and our company is registered
as an independent qualified party to be able to inspect the cable cars. - These cable cars are
the same as elevators in any other block of apartments. Just open to the elements, and not quite vertical. - I think it's worth it if you're older. Like as a young, fairly, quite fit person, I was a bit like, ""Oh, okay, ""I guess I just have this
annual expense now!"" But it is fun for parties, and everyone loves the cable car and it is great when you're moving house. - I started Access Automation
pretty much 30 years ago. And so we've been
designing and building them and maintaining them for that long. It's been absolutely fabulous experience, but I sort of feel like it's
time to pass the baton on now. That's something that requires new blood
to really let it flourish. It needs to be taken
beyond what I can do. I guess the most
satisfying part of this job is the fact that we're doing something
that helps people. We allow elderly people to
stay in their homes longer. At the other end of the scale, young professional couples, we allow them to develop properties
made on hillsides and sites that wouldn't otherwise
be able to be built on. So we're building a product that it's got a human element to it. I guess that's why I've
been doing it for so long and still enjoy it."
wcp1BfPUeOc,"- New Zealand has no native
land mammals other than bats. For around 85 million years,
these islands were so remote that the rest of the world's mammals
just never made it here. All the parts of the ecosystem
that mammals would fill instead went to birds,
or lizards, or insects. A lot of those birds are flightless, because there was nothing
they had to fly away from. And even the bats spend a
lot of time on the ground. Then in the 13th century, Māori arrived bringing with them one now-extinct
species of dog, and Polynesian rats. That wasn't great for the local species, and then in the 18th century, Europeans arrived and
brought... a lot. Rats, stoats, ferrets,
weasels, possums, all predators which the local creatures
had not evolved to defend against. If New Zealand wants to
keep its unique ecosystem and wants the local species to recover, at least the species that
aren't already extinct, then the blunt fact is that
either the local species are going to survive,
or the predators are. The only places in the
world that have managed to completely eradicate invasive species are very small islands a few
square kilometers across, or fenced-off reserves that are
regularly patrolled and studied. And most of those are in
and around New Zealand! But clearing something
the size of a country, and a rural country at that,
that's not just a challenge, that's a moonshot. So today I met with people
from Predator Free Wellington, because they're some of the folks who are making a start on it. - So this is one of
our trusty trap boxes. They get pretty hammered out here,
with all the elements. - There's no one in there right now? Okay. - Hope not.
[both laughing] No, it's still set. It's still baited. - Okay. - And then we've got a
bait station there too. It's basically toxin. So this is basically a
very secure plastic box, it's locked closed so
that pets and children, that sort of thing, can't get
access to the bait inside. And then in here, we've
got a toxic wax block. - Oh, you're just touching that. - Yup. [both laughing] - Well, people or even cats and dogs would have to eat a
huge quantity of this for it to have any effects, whereas a rat only needs really five grams
or so for a lethal dose. - Oh, wow. - So it makes it a really effective tool.
There's also an antidote. - And that is presumably
delicious to rats. - Yeah, they tend to love it. I don't know what the flavor is in there, it's a cereal-based bait, basically. - Right. - And then this other one
here is kind of interesting. - We'll wait for the plane. [plane engine roaring] Right next to the airport. - This is called Detex, so it's a non-toxic type of
bait and rats love to eat it, but the reason we use it is because it actually glows under
UV light, bright green. And so they'll eat this
and then their droppings or their urine or even
their insides will glow. And so for us and our barrier
system, it means that if we detect a rat along here
somewhere, or we catch one in a trap, we can work out where
it's come from, basically. - Right. So that peninsula
is free of rats. - Yep. Just about. - That section isn't. - Yup. - And the buffer is, right now,
the airport and this bridge here. - Yeah. So the airport provides a
really nice natural buffer area because rats don't
particularly like to be out in the open where it's super exposed. And so we don't see much evidence of them crossing that
big concrete expanse. - So the plan is: start at the
edge of the Miramar Peninsula, eradicate the predators there and then establish a buffer zone, and then keep pushing
that buffer zone back and back and back and back until eventually there
are no predators left in the whole of Wellington. - We've got about 5,800
traps in our network and then about 6,800 bait stations
of varying types. - The trap to me just looks
like a box with a hole in it. - Exactly. - And, if the rat can get in,
how does the rat not get out? - It's basically an entrance on one side and the mesh at the other
side they can see through, so it looks like a clear run for them. Which we've found
makes them more likely to go inside and investigate. And then we've got some
lure inside as well. So there's a paste that
just smells really good and so they'll go in for a nosey. I can whip this open, there we go. - Oh, okay. Yeah. - So it's a pretty grunty trap. - Yeah. In my head, up until this moment, I was like, oh, it's a trap. The rat goes in, the rat gets trapped,
you release the rat... No, you don't.
- Yeah, no. - No. That...
- No. This is definitely a lethal trap. - Yeah.
- Yeah. And it's humane certified to
the New Zealand standards. So we basically want traps
that the animal's not going to suffer more
than it needs to. It's going to be pretty
instant, pretty powerful. I can give you a demo of
setting it off if you'd like. - Yeah, absolutely. I mean, it's kind of really
brutal calculus, isn't it? Either the rat dies or the
unique species here dies. - Unfortunately. Yeah. I mean, it's never nice
to have to kill animals and rats, I've got a
lot of respect for them, they're great creatures
in their own right, but unfortunately they just can't coexist
with our native species. So, I can give this a demo. - On that note. Yeah, let's... - So I'm just going to use my gloves 'cos they're nice and soft,
and lob them in and hopefully that will set it off. Two, one. [trap clanks] There we go. - Okay. Yeah. - So it's pretty punchy. - That's going to be messy. - Yeah. - Yeah. How often do you have to
clean one of these out? - Not very much these days, thankfully. - Yeah. - Along here it's still
reasonably rare but we do catch probably about three rats each
time we service this barrier system. On the peninsula, we're catching a lot less
rats now, which is nice. Yeah. Especially in this hot weather. - You really do have to be so careful. - Oh, yeah. - How many people do you
have working on this? - So we've got a full-time
field staff of about 25, and then there's a few of us
in the office as well, doing the data crunching
and that sort of thing. - That's way more than I thought. - And then on top of that, we've
got a huge volunteer force. So they make up about 10%
of the efforts on Miramar Peninsula. - Right. And it's government
funded, presumably? - Yeah, a lot of it is.
So it's a big collaboration, this one. So, what we can see here, we've had a rat, come along and chewed this
monitoring card of ours. - So we call these chew cards. They're a really effective
monitoring tool. It's basically just a
piece of corflute plastic and then we mash peanut
butter into the gaps. - But it works a treat. So it's been here, within
the last week we know, because we've serviced
this quite recently. - You can't poison the peanut butter then? - Unfortunately not. We considered the avenue,
but I don't think the... - Of course, because that's something
that other creatures... - Other creatures could get to. A dog could have a nibble. And it's also the combining
of toxin with food is one of those things that... - Oh. - ...I don't think you're
technically allowed to do. So, we've got to be very
careful to keep it all safe and legal and all of that. - No, the trap has not been set off now. - The trap's not been set. So it's had a nibble,
it's getting interested, but it hasn't gone in yet. - Yet. [both laughing] - The trouble is, as long as there's
a breeding pair of rats anywhere outside that
buffer zone, there's a threat. Alberta in Canada is the only place outside of the poles
where there are no rats, and that's because rats
never got established there. A combination of harsh geography
on all sides and a vicious, almost obsessive
government-backed control program kept rats out, and
still does to this day. That's what Wellington will
always have to deal with, unless they just keep pushing. The reserve here, this is where
the rats have been eliminated rather than suppressed, right? - Yeah, exactly. So it took us about six months
of really intense efforts, but we've now eliminated all
of the rats out of this area. - So how do you know? - We've got a lot of
monitoring that goes into it, trail cameras, a big one. They're just about the
golden standard we can get for monitoring rats. You can see there's one
just tucked down in here. - Oh, spot the city boy.
[both laughing] Oh, okay. Yep. - So they're camouflaged to blend in as best they can, so that
the rats don't notice them and it's pointed at a motor lure. It's basically got a
syringe of mayonnaise inside with a little motor.
- Sure, okay. - And once a day, it
basically pushes out 1ml of mayonnaise from this syringe. Without us having to come
here every single day, it's keeping a fresh food source
and a fresh lure for these rats. - And anything that comes to eat it... - Gets caught on camera. - Right. - Yeah. It's a really
effective way of basically telling us if there's
any rats left in an area. And rats seem to love egg mayonnaise, so it works pretty well. - And are there any left? - Not in here. It's been a huge effort, but now
we can safely say it's rat free. - Is it working? Well, it seems to. The statistics say that animal life is
recovering on the peninsula. The key thing is, this isn't
limited to just Wellington, across the whole of New Zealand
there are groups doing the same. There's a government plan
called Predator Free 2050, but it is optimistic.
The plan that even admits that to pull this off on a national scale they'll need some new scientific discovery
to make this easier. And ""new scientific discoveries""
and ""ecosystem management"" are words that historically
haven't gone well together. Do you think it's going to work? Do you think that they'll get
New Zealand clear by 2050? - I think they will, yeah. I think just looking at
the progress we've made in the last couple of years
already, particularly here, we've learnt so much
in the last 12 months that if you extrapolate that out, I think we've definitely
got a good shot of it. I think we'll crack it. - Can it be done? Maybe. With enough money,
time and human effort. And from my limited time here I'd say that protection
of the land and ecosystem, the Māori word roughly
translated is 'kaitiakitanga', it seems to be part of
New Zealand's national identity, in a way I don't think I've seen
in any other country I've been to. Towns, regions, sure. But never a country. If anyone can pull this off,
it's going to be New Zealand."
6o38C-ultvw,"Oh, wow. The Parkes radio telescope,
here in Australia, is most famous for receiving pictures
from the Apollo 11 moonwalk. But it's still in near-constant use
for astronomy and scientific research. Now, it's a maintenance day here today, which is why I'm allowed to be here
on the surface of the dish. And the dish is about to tilt over, nearly all the way
to touching the ground, and I'm going to be here
while it happens. I'm going for a ride! But that would be a lot of
very slow, boring footage of me just awkwardly standing
and sitting here as my world tilts over. So while that's happening, let me show you how I got here. I'm going to be filming this awkwardly. We've got John here
who's going to show me around. We've got Jack behind the camera. Let's go see a telescope! - Yeah. Let's go in, Tom, and see
what it's like inside it. - You can tell it was built
in the '60s and '70s, can't you? Big asbestos warning. - This is the ground floor where we
have the air conditioning units that help keep all our electronics cool. - And the astronomers, presumably! - And the astronomers too. Just behind Jack here, we have the most important
room in the building, which is the astronomer's kitchen. If they do visit,
they can stay on site. But over the last 10 years, we've switched to a
remote observing regime where people can log in
over the internet to observe. So we have fewer and fewer
astronomers visiting now. But let's go on upstairs and have a look in
the main control room. So, follow me on up. [warning siren] - This is so weird, because... the clouds are rotating! I know the dish is rotating,
but I cannot see anything. - So, this is the old control room. The old control desk that was
recreated for the film, The Dish, used to be located about there. But in 1982, it was decommissioned
and replaced by a computerized desk that used the PDP-11 computers. It doesn't crash very often, because it doesn't have
an operating system. It just stays up very reliably. And so we still use it to
drive the dish around and to point the telescope too. If it's not broken,
we're not fixing it! The radio waves coming down
from the stars, they're reflected off the
parabolic surface of the dish, and they're brought to the focus where the radio waves
are concentrated. We can typically collect a
few terabytes of data a day, but with the new receivers that
we're commissioning later this year, we'll be looking at maybe
nine terabytes an hour. The telescope itself is an
extremely sensitive radio detector, because the energies that we're
collecting from the stars are incredibly weak. If I was to release the feather and let it slowly just drift
to the floor here like this, the energy that feather expended
when it struck the floor was more than all the energy ever collected
by every radio telescope ever built, in terms of the astronomical data. And so that's why radio telescopes
have to be so large, because you want as large a
collecting area as possible. Any electronic devices will transmit
radio waves that could very easily overwhelm the really feeble signals
we're trying to detect, such as mobile phones- - Such as these wireless mics, by the way! It's a maintenance day.
I got special permission for these! - That's right. A lot of this tech here
we've designed ourselves, but we also have other equipment
that we buy off the shelf, and then we have to
put them in shielded cabinets, because they're not really designed
to be radio-quiet, so to speak. A mobile telephone on the moon's surface,
400,000 kilometers away, would be one of the brightest
radio sources in the sky for us. So if we can detect it
from the moon, we have no trouble detecting it
from the car park! We refer to this as the
master control panel. If I was to turn this off here,
you can see it's on remote, it'll be on computer control
so that people off-site can log in, take control,
and move the telescope. But if I was to put it onto
local and master control, I'll be able to move it using these dials,
up and down, left and right. - Wait, the dials still work? - Oh, yeah. [warning siren] Oh, okay. Gravity is changing direction. I-- We got to walk this way. I guess we got to
stay horizontal here. I'm not actually sure what
horizontal is anymore. Am I still...? No, I think I need
to go further. I'm not horizontal yet. I've got no reference frame.
I can't see the horizon. I can't see anything.
This is dizzying! - Because we observe
remotely now, often, there's nobody in the tower
when we're observing. And so we need a way to make sure
the telescope's safe at all times. So we have this device called the
Telescope Protection System or TPS, which monitors hundreds of
data points on the telescope. And if it detects an issue
that might be a problem, it immediately alerts us using SMS messages, emails,
telex, everything. And we can immediately descend
on the telescope, see what's wrong,
and fix it. And we have an anemometer, as soon as the wind reaches
a certain critical speed, that's when we say,
the winds are too high, and we just stow the telescope. Because essentially, the telescope's
just a giant beach umbrella. - I mean, this thing's incredibly robust. It's held up to significant
wind and weather. - When it was commissioned
back in October 1961, it was only intended to
operate for 20 years. So we're now 41 years
over that. And the reason for it is because
we've continually upgraded the telescope. The most obvious upgrades have
been to the dish surface. - I'm not going to do anything,
but I... suddenly, I'm not walking on
the solid surface, I'm walking on the mesh
of the dish, and my brain is...
just about dealing with it? - We're going up into the
dish surface here. So we're first going up
through the spiral- - Spiral staircase! -spiral staircase in the
central column. This central column is on a
separate foundation to the rest of the building, because at the top of this column
is the master equatorial, the device that helps us point
the telescope accurately. So we don't want that connected to
the rest of the building because the vibrations will cause
the pointings of the telescope to be out. So come on up. - So all the cables here are
transmission cables? - That's right.
Yeah, they're bringing signals down from the focus cabin,
and also, we send other commands up to operate
the equipment and power it, and so on. Okay. - I just looked over and there's
a horizon all of a sudden! - We're now going to go through
the door down to the azimuth track. - Right. Okay. Oh, yeah. I just looked up. There's a telescope up there! - Before we go all the way down,
you can see this is the twister room. The cables coming down from the
focus cabin come down here first. There are two counter-rotating rings. So as the dish rotates in azimuth,
they counter-rotate, so they take up the
slack and release it, so that the cables don't get
twisted and tangled or anything like that. - Oh, that's very clever. - So this level is what we
call the azimuth track, and this is the actual
azimuth track. And if you look here, you can see it's
sitting on four rollers, but only two are driven. On this track, we move it
left and right like this. But you can see in
the center there, there's nothing actually
holding it down. It's just pivoted there. It's just the sheer weight of the structure
that keeps the telescope grounded. - Because everything from this level
on up weighs a thousand tonnes or the equivalent of
three fully-laden jumbo jets. - Yeah, okay! All right. - So when they built the
telescope back in the '50s, they didn't have computers that could do
the coordinate conversions fast enough. So instead, Barnes Wallis,
a really famous British engineer, he came up with this device,
essentially said it's an optical telescope. And because that's the polar axis, once you point the optical telescope
to the position you want on the sky, you only have to move it at a
constant rate around the polar axis so that you could then
follow the object smoothly across the sky. - You're adjusting for the earth's rotation
by just rotating something at the same angle
in the opposite direction. - In the opposite direction. And this was the secret
to the telescope's success, we were able to point
the telescope very, very accurately on the sky.
In fact, it was so successful that all subsequent large,
single-dish antennas employed a master equatorial
up until about the 1990s, when the microprocessors
were small enough and fast enough to do the coordinate conversions
on the fly. Before we go up,
let's have a little walk around the super structure
just under the dish. So, here we go. - You're walking around here
a lot more casually than I am! - Oh, okay! You can see here,
this is a great view. You can see out towards the east
where we have the Hervey Ranges that shield us from the
radio emissions from the larger population centers
further east. - Right. - This is one of the reasons
why it was chosen. It's very radio-quiet. - All right.
So, next stop... - Yeah.
- Surface. We'll go around.
We'll keep going around, and then we'll end up
where we started. - If you just turn the camera
around that way for a moment, that's where I was
standing a moment ago, was in the middle of that dish. This ride I'm taking
isn't just a gimmick. It's called a ""hayride""
sometimes, but it turns out that's a term
that was invented by Americans for a film that was shot here
more than 20 years ago. The folks at Parkes actually just
call this ""riding the dish"", and they use it to get
heavy equipment in and out of the central part. Because it's a lot easier
to let the dish do the lifting instead of trying to actually
lug bulky gear through all the corridors
and stairwells inside. Two hands on the railing... and we're down! Thank you very much, folks! Thank you, Jack!"
PSrO55KS6VY,"I know that the phrase ""sentinel chickens""
does sound a bit ridiculous. These chickens here in Griffith,
in rural Australia, are not keeping watch for anything.
They're not on guard. They are just... chickens. But they are helping keep folks
in this area of New South Wales safe from some nasty diseases. Diseases like Murray Valley
Encephalitis, MVE. It infects animals,
including humans, and it's carried by mosquitoes. It has no vaccine, no cure. Most people who get it will
suffer fever and nausea, but about one in a thousand
will get seriously ill, with a chance of life-changing
brain injuries, or death. If that virus is starting to flare up
in the animal population around here, mosquito transmission means
it can easily spread to humans, so it'll be really useful
for the local health department to have an early warning system. - We have eight flocks at the moment,
and there are 15 birds per flock. They are usually between 9 and 14
weeks old when we get them, at the start of the season. They are fed, watered
and they lay eggs. And that's an additional bonus for the
person that's looking after our coop. They get to keep the eggs. - Ideally, the researchers would
track levels of the virus in wild animals and birds.
That's where it thrives. But that plan involves catching
and testing wild animals. Not practical. So instead, chickens! They don't get sick from MVE
or other diseases like it, and they can't pass
it on either. But if they get infected,
their immune system still fights it,
still creates antibodies. The technical term
is ""seroconversion"". And these chickens are outside
every hour of every day, and the mosquitoes will
bite them a lot. - We take a small amount of blood
from each chicken, weekly. They collect the chickens,
and then we do a bleeding process where they take a small amount
of blood via a lancet from under the wing, collected on
a small blotting strip. It's just a very small pinprick. The chickens have a leg band on, so that we know very specifically
what bird and what sample, and we can match them up. And that goes off to
our labs in Sydney where they do a number of tests for
a whole range of mosquito-borne viruses. The mosquito levels are
important as well, but it's not enough
just to track mosquitoes. It's important that we monitor
a reservoir that can give us a
better indication, quicker. The chickens give us a
pretty early warning, within a couple of weeks. If we saw seroconversions
in our flocks, we would ramp up the local media
to get that message out: use a repellent, not be outside
at dawn and dusk, and wear light,
loose-fitting clothing. Camping groups,
fishing groups, those people that are visiting areas
get the message as well. We'll provide information
to local GPs so that they will be
looking for symptoms. And there are other flocks
in other countries, I'm sure, as part of their
surveillance program. - Of course, once a chicken has
tested positive, its work is done. It will always have
those antibodies, it will always test positive. So at that point,
it is retired, and I'm assured that's
not a euphemism, and testing continues on
the rest of the flock. I was a bit worried about
animal safety and cruelty here, but... Do you mind?! ...the chickens are well cared for! They're just having a blood sample
taken occasionally. In a world with factory farming
and fried chicken shops, this does seem fairly low down
on the scale of ""things humanity
does to chickens"". - We really have no other way
of knowing what virus might be around in the area. And they do save lives. - Never work with animals(!) Th- This is not food!
These are my fingers!"
2nQ-rijlX3o,"- The second oldest rollercoaster
in the world is this: the Great Scenic Railway
at Luna Park in Melbourne, Australia. It was built in 1912. And it's one of very few
roller coasters in the world where the brakes are
still operated manually, where a brake operator,
like Freya there, rides along on every run,
timing everything and making sure that the
riders go over the hills at exactly the right speed
every time. So obviously, I had some questions for Freya and the team here
about how it all works. But I thought I might want to wait until Freya was a little bit less busy! - I have been driving for
about five or six years now, which is a lot of fun. Sending people around on a rollercoaster is a pretty unusual job. We usually try and keep people
on only for an hour at a time, 'cause it can
get very tiring, obviously. It's all manual labor,
slowing it down. We do about 24 hours'
worth of training, which includes doing a
walk up the track, theory, as well as a lot and a lot
and a lot of driving. Same as driving a car,
trying to expose them to as many different
conditions as possible. - I did not expect to get actual air time
from a 110-year-old rollercoaster. Wow. That's not a bad
view from up here either! - It is so dependent on the conditions
that you're driving on. There's no, ""this is exactly how
you drive the train every time"". Everyone has their own
little ways of doing it. We obviously don't just throw
someone behind the brake and say, ""go for it,"" because
standing up on a rollercoaster is a weird thing to do! Once they're all comfortable
standing up, we'll move them behind the brake. And as the trainer, you will tell them
when to apply and not apply brake. And from then on it's
just doing a lot of laps to get experience in different conditions. Every cycle you run is different. You've got to be able to
make those judgment calls. If it is too windy, depending on the direction
it's coming from, it will stop the train. So we keep an eye out
on the wind radar and things like that
to keep a ballpark, as well as, our drivers
have a pretty good idea of how that's impacting the train. Rain, we also don't run in. It makes the train go way too fast and it becomes difficult
to actually slow it down. If it does come to a stop, if it's too windy or
something like that, we get a team of people
to come up. They walk up the track,
which they're all trained how to do. And then give it a big
push start to get it going, which is always a bit of
fun and entertainment for all of the guests on board! - Sure, this is more than 100 years old, but it needs to perform to
21st-century safety standards and get 21st-century inspections. So how does it do that? - Where we run into
modern safety rules, we have to negotiate with
the Heritage Council and say, ""this is the most sensitive way
we can possibly achieve the result"". It's a difficult balancing act. And a very, very
expensive one to maintain. Continuous maintenance. And by no means is
it off the shelf! It's all 1900s equipment. We have to replace
like-for-like wherever possible. That means we have to have
them manufactured specially. It's a never ending job. So we only run two trains on the track. The first train that is dispatched is required to get
halfway round the track before we dispatch the next one. Now there are four blocks
defined on the track by lights. Two opportunities on every
circuit to pull the train up. That was done nigh-on 20 years ago. Modern legislation,
we had to conceive of everything that
could possibly go wrong. The longer you leave risk, the more chance it's
got of occurring! And there have been discussions
to modernize that control system so that brakes on the train
could be invoked externally. All of these things are on the list, and will eventually have to happen. No question. - Freya, Thank you very much! - That's all right."
FhHM9MT41IE,"- Most architecture students
at most universities learn to design buildings, but don't actually build
anything bigger than a model. Construction isn't an
architect's job, after all. Their job is to design. But behind me is Poly Canyon,
up in the hills above California Polytechnic State University, or Cal Poly for short. For decades, some of the
senior architecture students at Cal Poly have designed and built experimental final projects at full scale in the ""architecture laboratory"". And some of those
projects are really weird. (in person) So everything here was
built by the students? - Yes. A lot of times it's
based on their schoolwork and it's in a topic that they
want to explore more deeply. They come up with the design, the materials that they need, they do a cost estimate. Some of these go back...
I'm not quite sure if the '60s, but definitely early '70s. - So how many structures are there? - I think there's about 21 or 22
that are still kind-of standing. - It's not like every student does
a senior project that's here? It's, if they've got a design
they want to make real, and they can find the funding for it? - Exactly. - Cal Poly will give
them the space to do it. - Exactly. - How often is there a new building here? - They come really in spurts. Like someone will build and I think then the students hear about
other groups building, so then they might try and do something. We might get one project maybe
every two to three years, on average. They try and make it like you
were working in the real world. So you have to go through our
facilities department here and they have to get a building permit. And these days there's also a plan for
what will be the upkeep. So it's open to public.
So if you're on campus, everyone is welcome to
explore the area. And I was amazed when I first
started coming out here again, 'cause I went to Cal Poly as an undergrad
and so when I came back, I was really amazed at how
much the Canyon gets used. And especially in the
afternoons and on weekends. There's quite a bit of foot traffic. - I've seen little tensegrity structures
for, you know, desk toys. But that's a full building. That's, that's massive! That must have been done in
computer simulation first. - They did do some computer modeling. I had them build some
models with stick and string so that we could just make
sure we got the geometry right. - Close up, this almost seems reasonable. My brain's not breaking, looking at it. And then you take a step back and you realize that this
whole central section and the two things dangling down here, it's just these cables. - Exactly, yeah. - It really feels like
it should drop down. When the buildings here are completed, they're left to stand,
to face the elements, which means some locals call this place
the ""architecture graveyard"". But I don't think that's fair, because there is upkeep here. The buildings are maintained, but cost and time are
always going to be issues. - There was a time when
people used to live here. - Really? - They were curators of Poly Canyon. And so they lived in some
of these various structures. They would stay here. And they had running water and
some electricity,   but they would stay here
and the idea was that they would do minor repairs
in exchange for housing. It was a really interesting time. This was the last space that
was used for caretakers. Two bedrooms. They were in--
- Wow. - One was in this module here, this square that you see above your head. And then there was another bedroom right over this module here. And then they had a kitchen. A bathroom was right here. And then like a living
space was right over here. But everything's stable.
It holds up. - Yeah. - And you know, it's
mostly visitors like us, so there's not a lot
of activity down here. - Who funds it if they
want to build something? - Right, so a lot of
times the college may have a little bit of money to help them, more like seed money to get them started. But the students will go
out to companies that have a relationship with the college and they'll pretty much ask
for, not necessarily money, but materials that that company sells. - And they're actually doing the graft
to put stuff together as well? - They did everything together. It's amazing what you'll see. And then actually two of them ended up
coming back and getting married here. - In Poly Canyon? - In Poly Canyon, under their structures. - I really like this place. I've wanted to visit here for a long time, but parts of it are run down. As soon as one vandal tags a
structure and breaks the ice, a lot more people think it's somehow okay to turn up with spray paint. I'm worried about publicizing this. I've got a responsibility
to the places I visit and the people I work with. And there are plenty of other things that have been ruined
by too many tourists... ...or too many YouTubers. But Poly Canyon is open to the public. You can hike out here and stand
in these buildings yourself. This isn't an architecture graveyard, it's an art gallery. - The hope was, you know, if we can show
that it is still living, right? Then maybe people start to take care of it so that it can last for the
next generation of students. - See, now I want to come down here with a bucket of whitewash and help. - Exactly, yes.
Well, I will let you know, if you happen to be in California...! - I might take you up on that. - Or even if you know people. - Yeah. - Yeah, we'll put you up for the night."
Wif1EAgEQKI,"Almost two years ago, I made
a video about fire marks. Back in the 18th century, firefighters in London were
funded by insurance companies. When you insured a building,
you would be given a fire mark, a big plaque to put on the front And if a fire ever broke out, all the various companies' firefighters
would rush to the scene. and the story goes that
they would look at the building, and only fight the fire
if they saw their company's mark, or the mark of a company that
they had an agreement with. ""If the building wasn't insured,
they would let it burn."" This is a really well-known
story in Britain, it's part of the standard
'history of the fire brigades'. Panel show QI has talked about it. ""If you hadn't paid, they wouldn't
put your fire out. ""Unless you happened to be next
to someone else who had."" Children's TV show Horrible Histories
did a whole sketch on it including the host,
a talking rat, holding up a sign that says
'they really did this'. And the sources I used for my video
included the history page on the London Fire Brigade Museum's
own website. This was not controversial. Now, soon after publication, I was told
about one embarrassing error in the video: the plaques I filmed weren't
actually fire marks. There's no list of all the
surviving marks anywhere, but I found stock photos of some marks
with locations attached, and I figured, great,
I can just film there. But, those captions are wrong, whoever wrote them
was completely mistaken, apparently those are
parish boundary markers. Which is not great, but it
s the sort of thing I can fix by pinning a correction, it doesn't affect whether the
main part of the video is true. But. About a month ago,
I got an email that was like, you know that source you used,
the London Fire Brigade Museum's page? It doesn't say that. And it doesn't. The page has
been changed, and it now says: ""There is little real evidence to
suggest that this was the case."" So I was straight off into
a rabbit hole of research. Because this was exactly on
a weird borderline in my head: at times I was like,
well, actually, that makes no sense
when you think about it, no-one would let a fire burn if
they were standing there with water. It's got to be an urban legend. And then I'd switch to, well, there were many more cruel
things going on in that century. Heck, there still are, there are
places in the world where that system exists today,
it's summed up as ""no pay, no spray"". And it seemed like every source I read
had a slightly different opinion. I couldn't find any actual
testimonials from the time, and the secondary and tertiary
sources that I had access to didn't go into any depth: most of them just briefly stated it
as an unreferenced fact and said no more. I'm on the road right now,
so I can’t go into archives, and even if I could,
I wouldn't know where to start. So: I hired an experienced, professional
archives research consultant. My brief was simple:
is the story true? Answering that took the consultant
two weeks of work. Not two weeks of
undergrad-slacking-off-time, I mean two solid weeks of
eight-hour work days, including visiting the
British Library to check documents that
haven't been digitised yet. He's put together a
thoroughly-referenced report, I've linked it down
in the description. And now I'm going to summarise
his summary in about 60 seconds. Here we go. Through the 18th century,
fire marks were an indicator of whether a building was insured, but the general policy of
London insurance companies was that their firefighters
did try to fight all fires, whether insured or not.
Three reasons why: One. A fire in an
un-insured building can easily spread
to an insured property, or dozens of insured properties. Economically, it made sense
to cut the problem off as early as possible. Two. It is really good advertising
to have smartly dressed firefighters rushing in to save the day. And three: it was the
right thing to do. There are good references
from the time to back all that up. But. By 1721, there were eight
fire insurance offices in London. We don’t know how many actual
fire brigades there were, but there were enough for there
to be rivalries between them. And there was also a law
that gave reward money to the first, second, and third
brigades to attend a fire. That's one of the reasons
they raced to fires so fast, they got paid more if they did. So sometimes, too many firefighters
would turn up. They couldn't all help, and there might not be enough
fire-fighting water for all of them. Many of those firefighters were
recruited from being watermen on the River Thames,
rough-and-ready ferry workers. So if they weren’t quick enough,
and they missed out on the reward, and it wasn't a building
insured by their company anyway, they might just stand back,
jeer a bit, or worst case, maybe even interfere with the folks who were going to get the
reward money instead of them. That is, in the researcher's view, the most probable place
that the story came from. There are so many more
subtleties than that, this is not certain,
history is fractal and you can always, always find
more detail if you keep looking. We're summarising more
than 150 years here. But big picture: did some firefighters
ever stand back and let a building burn? Yes, it probably did happen. But there's no evidence
from the time to show it was ever an official, standard
policy for insurance fire brigades in 18th century London. I was wrong. QI was wrong.
Horrible Histories was wrong. Hundreds, maybe thousands, of pop-history
books and storytellers were wrong. We think. If any history students are
looking for a PhD topic, it feels like you could get
three years of research out of this and still not end up
with a definitive yes or no. It's a perfect example of
how quickly and how badly even big important stories
can become muddled, and how the study of history
is not about memorising dates: it's about the interpretation
of really messy, patchy data. So I have pulled my original video.
It's unlisted now. I've put a link in the description
here for posterity, but YouTube won't
ever recommend it, it won't show up
in search results, and I've put a big
warning on it. Also: turns out I made
another error anyway, I said the wrong organisation name
later on in the video. As ever, you shouldn't trust me. Sometimes I blunder, sometimes I'm
standing on the shoulders of mistaken giants. Anyone who tells you they're certain
about how the world works is either a mathematician,
or they're selling something. Like, this video's sponsor,
NordVPN. Really, it is sponsored,
I'm finding them incredibly useful. I'm not going to be home for Christmas,
but my internet connection can be. Lots of web sites and apps block international traffic,
or redirect it. They think they're being clever, they think they're helping
some international user, but I'm actually abroad trying to order Christmas presents
from Britain for people in Britain, so it's really annoying. That's not some made-up example, one site just kept bouncing me to
.com instead of .co.uk. But now, I can click NordVPN's
magic button that lets me say I'm back in the UK, or in any one

vIfC4Aj05Ps,"The only thing I knew about
wasps before this video was that they are those flying insects that
hover round picnics and sting people. That was it. I assumed, naively, that wasps had no useful role
in the world's ecosystem. So when someone from the
Oregon Department of Agriculture got in touch and said that they
send out taxpayer-funded wasps... I had some questions. Like... why? - This is pest control at a
ecosystem-wide level. There are hundreds of thousands
of species of wasp and only a handful of those
actually sting people. The vast, vast majority of them
go about their entire life, and you never see them or notice them. - Around the turn of the century, the brown marmorated stink bug
arrived in the United States. It's originally from East Asia, but enough of them had been
carried in accidentally by global trade that a breeding population started
and then exploded. Those stink bugs are now found
across most of the continent, and they consume crops like
apples, pears, hazelnuts and soybeans, causing millions of dollars
in damage every year. - They are a generalist pest. They feed on hundreds of
different plant species, and they have a great range of
climatic conditions that they're perfectly happy
to live in. Its populations have reproduced
without anything to check it. - So what you want is the
stink bug’s natural enemy: which is a particular type of wasp,
that's being bred inside this chamber. - Parasitoid wasps attack other insects and lay their eggs
inside of them to reproduce. Sometimes that's an insect egg. Sometimes they eat the insect alive,
starting at the least vital organs first. This is where the inspiration for
the chest-burster from Alien came from. We breed the stink bugs because the
parasitoid wasps need them to reproduce in. As many stink bug eggs as we have
is about as many wasps as we can produce. Last year we produced around 20,000, and the year before that
we produced around 17,000. - And they are tiny! I didn’t realise
until I got here and saw them that you could get wasps that
are only about a millimetre long. They’re so delicate that the researchers
can't use tweezers to move them around. they have to gently suck them up
through chiffon fabric using the housing of a ballpoint pen. But human intervention in ecosystems
doesn't have a great history, so my next question was: well, how do they know what
to release and where? - Researchers from USDA
and different universities went to Asia to find out
what attacks it in Asia, and why is it not such
a big problem there. They brought Trissolcus japonicus
back over to the United States into quarantine facilities, tested it on North American species
to see if there were any that we didn't test in Asia,
that it could also attack. Decades of work go into making sure that the wasps that we're
releasing are also safe. If we give it brown marmorated
stink bug eggs and any other stink bug, it'll choose brown marmorated stink bug
95+% of the time. But if you give it just
another stink bug egg mass, it will use it if there's
no other choice. So we were actually a little
on the fence about whether or not we wanted to release it. And then it showed up anyways. - After years and years of work,
the wasps showed up anyway, because every year,
millions of flights land and millions of shipping containers
arrive at ports, and it's not like those are sterile. So, now that the fight is being set up
out in the wild anyway: why do they still breed and release these? - The parasitoid wasp needs
some time to catch up. It's around a millimeter and a half long.
It can't fly very far. We can drive it a lot further than
it can fly in a single year. So we actually get those populations started without having to fly across
the entire state of Oregon. Normally the growers reach out to
the Department of Agriculture and we go out to a site visit. Not every site is suitable for these wasps. They're actually nectar feeders and pollinators,
so they actually do need other plants present. They can provide permanent, long-lasting
pest control for not just growers, but the entire ecosystem. These do not sting people. I have worked with not only this wasp, but other
wasps that are much larger than it that are parasitoid wasps,
and I have never been stung, and I've been working on these
for over a decade."
eMTZvA8iFgI,"- Under the streets of Vancouver, at the University of British Columbia, there are pneumatic tubes
2½ kilometers long that use air pressure to transport
slightly radioactive stuff underground from a particle accelerator
to a hospital. The tubes are called the Rabbit Line and the only sign of
them from the surface is a few manholes, and some
little studs in the ground to mark the path. Most of the students and staff
here at UBC have no idea that a few times every day,
underneath their feet, capsules with radioactive stuff speed by
at up to 100 kilometers an hour. So, we're going to start at
the particle accelerator here and explain how: how the
stuff's made and how it's sent. And then, at the receiving end,
at the hospital, we're going to explain why. - This is the GMP Lab at TRIUMF,
and here, we use medical isotopes
and make tracers for imaging and therapy. So, in accelerators,
we have cyclotrons. So cyclotron: we inject H-, so
negative charges of hydrogen, and they spin around and get
really, really fast. Carry a lot of energy. And then we extract
that H- to proton. And then we use a proton beam
to hit a target. Once they hit a target, it will
produce radioactive isotopes. And once we have the isotopes, they will be transferred here. And here, our chemists
will do their magic. So they combine with some
injectable liquid, mostly saline. The ones processed in this
lab are short-lived isotopes, two in particular, one is carbon-11. And the carbon-11 only
has 20 minutes half-life. Our chemists doing a very, very fast job, and then they send this
through the Rabbit Line to UBC Hospital and inject patients. For the long-lived isotopes, we produce probably nanogram range. The short-lived one is even
smaller than that amount. That's all you need. - So, particle accelerator
upstairs makes the isotopes. Chemists in the clean room
turn them into a liquid. The team in this room put
that vial inside a rabbit, a capsule, and into that tube. There's one already loaded. Close it up, push the right buttons, and 100 psi of air pressure accelerates it to a top speed of 100 kilometers an hour. Now, I am not allowed to
send a camera down the line. It's really carefully calibrated. You don't take risks like
that with medical treatments. Plus, it's pitch black. I'd also have to send a light as well. But I did ask if I could push the button. It's just the big one
marked send, right? Okay. [machine beeping]
[air whooshing] That is surprisingly loud. - Because we are sending
it over underground,  soil under the road will serve
as a very good shielding, also because the amount we
send is very, very little, we're sending a dose that's actually safe to inject in a human inside a body. So for the public, there's no hazard. If we drive up the street, it would take about 10, 15 minutes. But if we shoot through the Rabbit Line, it only takes a little
bit over two minutes. And it's more reliable. And we don't need to stop at stop signs! - About 2½ minutes later, the capsule arrives here
at the University Hospital. But that does raise the question, when the capsule is going that fast, how does it stop in the
right place every time? - When it's close to the end, about 10 meters to the end,
there is a vent. So you will lose the pressure
from the compressed air. And also, the front,
the air is compressed, so it serve as a buffer to
slow down the rabbit as well. And that which allows the rabbit
to drop safely at hospital. [capsule thumping] - That isn't the same capsule. It's a 10-minute drive away. The Rabbit Line is incredibly fast. Which leaves the big question, why? Well, what's being sent
are radiopharmaceuticals, slightly radioactive stuff
that here is meant for research in medicine. Obviously, I'm not filming
any research subjects here, but the staff let me know
what sort of thing this can be used for. - When this radioactive substance decays, it emits gamma rays, which we detect. In doing that, we can then
reconstruct the image. You can actually see how the brain works without really getting into the brain. A very, very important picture
that you couldn't get otherwise. By definition, they cannot have any
 pharmacological effect on the body. If we were to inject anything
that changes the system, we're not looking at the system. We're looking at the system as modified. In Parkinson's disease, by the time you have clinical symptoms, the brain is already very, very damaged. That's why we observe populations at risk. And then, of course,
we've done some studies in psychiatry, mood disorders,
in dementia, addiction. The discovery that there is a
neurochemical placebo effect, a neurotransmitter release
when people were expecting some benefit of a drug, even when a drug was not given. - It turns out, around the world, quite a few hospitals have
their own particle accelerators, maybe for diagnosis, maybe for treatment, maybe like here, for research. Although they do normally use
a slightly less dramatic way of transporting the results. Which left me with two questions. No one could answer the first, which is why it's called the Rabbit Line. Apparently, no one here knows. But the second one was, how do they get the
rabbits back to the start? - Drive it, we pick it
up or they send it over. Old-school! [laughing]"
nCrTsWtPVIY,"The Bay of Fundy in eastern Canada
has the highest tides in the world, anything up to 16 metres difference
between low tide and high tide. And the effects of that show up
in a few places around here. Like Hopewell Rocks, where I'm not
standing on a beach right now, I'm standing on the ocean floor. That's how far the tide is out. Actually, I'm kind of
sinking into it. But in a few hours' time, those rocks will be
half-way underwater, and if I stuck around, I would be drowning in very cold,
very fast and very deep ocean. But I'm not going to do that! Instead, I'm going to go about
40km that way, to-- --Moncton. It's the next morning,
it's very cold, and I'm flying a drone to try and
get a shot of the tidal bore. This is one of the few places in
the world where, every high tide, a wave of water washes upstream
against the current. But the most obvious sign of the tides
around here is in-- --Saint John, at the Reversing Falls, where a massive river
meets the Bay of Fundy at a narrow channel
filled with rocks and snags. This isn't just a tidal river:
it's a tidal set of rapids. Calling it a ""waterfall""
is maybe a bit generous, but at low tide the water
definitely has a gradient, it drops a couple of metres in height
over a really short distance. And then a few hours later at-- --high tide, the whole
flow reverses, and the river's dropping a few
metres in height the other way. And so the obvious question I had was: why has nobody turned that bay
into a power station yet? Actually, question number one:
why are the tides so high here? To answer that, I'll use the
bathtub in my hotel room. For this ""scientifically-rigorous""
demonstration, the Bay of Fundy is represented
by the bathtub, and the Atlantic tides and all
the unimaginable pressure created by megatonnes of water
is represented by... ...my arm. So. Moon pulls on the ocean, tide
comes in, pressure gets applied, and a wave heads down the bathtub,
the Bay of Fundy, and bounces back. 'Cos it's not like the water
all rises simultaneously. It takes time, and yes, the scale
here is colossally different, but you still get a wave effect, a reflection, and a trough
that follows the wave. Tick, tock. Tick, tock. And that will always take
roughly the same time to go up and bounce back, it'll be affected a little bit by
the weather and water temperature. So what happens when the
next tide comes in? If I time each push to go with
the wave that's already there, then very quickly, you start seeing
a resonant frequency, and a lot of power... Wah! That worked way better
than I expected it to! The resonant frequency of the
Bay of Fundy is roughly 12½ hours, the same as the tidal cycle.
Combine that with geography that's less like a bathtub
and more like a funnel, getting tighter and tighter
as that wave comes in, and you have the highest tides
in the world, right there. The power is immense
and it's obvious. And if it could be harnessed,
then it'd be reliable and renewable. Intermittent, sure,
but on a schedule that would be simple for the grid
to predict and plan around. So why aren't there tidal power stations
all around the Bay of Fundy? Well, the answer is: it's been tried.
A lot. Usually in the-- --Minas Basin, where several companies have put millions and millions of dollars
behind technical trials. And every time, the Bay of Fundy
breaks the turbines! 2009: a turbine was ""torn apart"". 2010: two blades ""broken off"". 2018: ""damaged beyond repair"". Turbines in these waters have
to be light enough to spin, but strong enough to resist
high speed salt water that carries huge amounts of sediment
and big rocks along with it, and in winter, enormous
chunks of sea ice. Oh, and that's before we even
start talking about the concerns from First Nations peoples
and commercial fishing operations that maybe putting a load of
giant spinning things in the water might cause some problems for fish. But people are still trying, there are
more experimental turbines planned. Can it be done? Maybe. I thought about doing long interviews with the tidal power companies
and their opponents around here, but those interviews would have
sounded the same twenty years ago. And the result would have just been
a much longer way of saying: maybe. If it can ever be done,
safely and reliably, it'd be brilliant,
I hope that happens. But there's also a decent chance
that the Bay of Fundy is just going to tear the
turbines apart again, and in twenty years, the answer
still will be: maybe. And now, today's-- --sponsor. I saved $200 on the
rental car that got me here, because I used NordVPN. Turns out some car rental companies
charge locals more: same car, same contract,
same everything, I went all the way to the
final checkout to make sure. But because I’d clicked NordVPN’s
magic button that let me pretend I was still back in the UK, I got quoted the UK price,
which is a lot cheaper. I’ve no idea why, but that one
transaction was worth way more than what I paid for a

some British sites keep trying to be helpful and
automatically redirect me to .ca domains, or even occasionally say
that I can’t access them at all because I’m not a local. Now I can say my phone or laptop

I99Qgb4mE5I,"- Just to set your expectations: I'm not jumping from that tower today. And I'm not jumping
from that tower either. I am going up there and, frankly, I've seen the
route I've got to take, it looks terrifying enough. But that 20 meter platform
is twice the height of the tallest Olympic standard board. If I jump from up there, I'd hit the water at about
70 kilometers an hour. That's easy enough speed
that, with no training, I would be in hospital. I've even got to be harnessed in
while I'm up there just in case. But that doesn't apply to Lysanne Richard, world class high diver
and cliff diver who is going to show me the way up and then take the quick route down. And down here, safely at pool level, someone from the
Montreal Olympic Park's team is going to explain why they
built a board that high. - It's the biggest
aquatic center in Canada. It's a facility that was built
for the Olympics back in 1976 and it's also right now home
of Team Canada in many sports. It's also open to the public. - How long have you been training to be able to do this sort of thing? - I did gymnastic and
diving and circus before, but it's been already
22 years that I'm a high diver. - And you were in Cirque du Soleil right? - Yes. I worked at Cirque
du Soleil for a while, but I never did diving
with Cirque du Soleil. - Okay. - It was completely renovated in 2015. Lysanne was well aware
of the Olympic Center. She was also training here. So when we renovated, she looked at all the
space here and she said maybe you could put a high
diving platform there. And we started with a 18 meter platform. Then two years later she said,
well, you know, I think you guys got room
for a 20 meter platform. So we built a 20 meter platform, and we became the only
place in North America where people can perform high
diving in an interior space. Winter can be harsh sometime, but because we have this facility,
they can train all year long. - So how do you learn to do this? do you just, like, work up
from lower heights and- - Yeah! You do not do high
diving if somebody asks you. - Right. - Like, you really have to feel that
you have to do it, you know? So just right here. - Okay. Up the ladder. Oh, I can feel the positive
pressure, the heat... There's air coming up through here! - Yeah, so this is the last chance of
changing your mind! - Yeah, no, it's fine. I'm going to be harnessed in.
It's okay. - Yeah - Let's go. - The structure that is here
was built initially because people needed to have
access to change the lights. The 12 and the 15 meters is attached to the platform that we have right here. But the 20 meter is
attached through the roof. - I've got to be harnessed in
up here with a lot of stuff. You just have a safety loop. - Because I'm an acrobat, I have the authorization to
go only with the hand loop. - Right. Let's go. Oh, this platform bounces! - Yes. Because it bends, it's not
going to break. All right! - Yeah. You are 15 meters up
from the floor. - Okay. Lead the way. So how many times a day can you do this?
'Cause it's got to be a physical strain. - Yeah. I do more of the complementary
training than high diving. 'Cause I'm 41. At one point I had
enough impact on my body, so now I train everywhere else and I do high diving to perform. Depending of your age, of your injury, you can go a maximum
six times, by day. - Okay. - But you cannot do every day
and you cannot high dive every month. - It's that much strain on your body. - Yeah, because after high diving you need a recovery time, you know. - Because you're hitting
the water at what, 70 kilometers an hour,
something like that? - Exactly. But in some of my
challenges, I go 27 meters, so it's pretty fast. And here, the water is warm,
so it's easier on the body. But when we go outside or in competition- - Oh you might be cliff diving
into cold ocean? - Yeah, yeah. - We know that FINA, which is the
Federation of Aquatic Sports, are working towards having
this sport in the Olympics. So we said, well, we might
as well have the equipment. We also did the same
thing with skateboarding. We also have a big bowl. So the goal here is to say after 45 years, how can we be in the game,
and be also a place, where athletes still
come train 45 years later. - This is the 15 meter! - This is brand new,
now we have 15, to build up the next
high diving generation. - Wow. - So there's the 10, 12, 15, 18 and 20, it makes it really safe, because they do not learn
too fast and have accidents. - Olympic Games last only two weeks. So what's happening when you pay more than a billion dollars
for Olympic facilities? You need to think about the future. - You have a zip wire! - Yes. A zip line for this, and I also always put
the shoes down, I can- - And that's just fun,
that is, that's- - I'm always jealous of my shoes. I would like to go ""aaagh""! - We are able to be a place
where they can practice but we can also host some
competition, which is quite nice for a facility that was built 46 years ago. - This is the one bit
where I'm not harnessed in. - Yeah. - Okay. There we go. You're entirely unharnessed - Mm hmm. - And I've got twintails on.
All right. - But you know, when we dive
it's better to be unharnessed! - Yeah, yeah it is! Okay. I guess that's the one
question I haven't asked, which is ""why"". Why did you
choose to take this up? - At the beginning I wanted to do it because I felt brave and I
wanted to be one of the men. 'Cause at the beginning, no women were doing this sport, you know? So I wanted to prove that
women, we can make it. Then at one point I wanted to do it to help the sport progress
and go to the Olympics, and help to build, to have the
next generation and to win. But now I do not need to compete anymore. I want to inspirate the people being involved into
the progress of the sport. I'm totally in the present moment
when I do high dive, and I'm a mom, I have three kids,
I have a lot of jobs. When I high dive
there is nothing, no grocery list, nothing. - So I now just duck under here. Agh. I'm harnessed in, I'm harnessed in. I'm harnessed in. I'm harnessed in...
I've got two separate harness points. All right. - This is where champions
are built, right here, in those facilities, which are
also accessible to everybody. - (low voice) I don't want to
distract her at this point but when you're up here,
you do realize that is... that's a very long way down. [cheering]
Woo! I'd applaud, but my hands are a bit busy. Right, I'm going to take the
slow route down, it's safer."
wbVIBmoUdUs,"The trouble with a lot of
real world experiments is that you can't have a control group. If you're researching, say,
how riverbanks are affected by erosion, then either you have to
observe the erosion happening in the wild, with lots of messy variables
like weather and climate and wildlife, or you have to rely on tiny scale models
or computer simulations. You can't take an actual river,
let it erode its banks for a while, then stop the water, rebuild everything, and just run it again
with one thing changed. Unless you build your own river,
which is exactly what the University of Sherbrooke in Canada
has done. Will you start the pumps, please! - So I’ve done a lot of studies
in nature, on real rivers. You do get excellent information, but you can't pick out
specific variables and play with them. We built this with the idea
that we can study sediment transport on a scale that represents
close to a small river or creek. The water starts in the reservoir. The pumps pump from the reservoir,
and then it discharges into the approach channel,
which is made to be very large, so that we diminish any turbulence that might be brought in there
by the pumps. After that, we have a weir, and then it
arrives in the river and goes down. And that's where we do our experiments. And the river falls
over an overflow into a sediment trap. From the sediment trap,
it goes back into the reservoir. It’s a recirculating system. Probably takes 2 or 3 minutes
for the water to recirculate. It is all repeatable. We can adjust the pumps
for a certain level, have that one day, come back a week later and have the same flow
coming through the system. We have two 70kW pumps. At the moment, we have 800 liters per
second, and we have room for another pump. - Okay, compared to the Mississippi,
this doesn't look that big. But here's how powerful it is. We anchored down a GoPro camera
to get those shots near the weir,
and the water just blasted it away. One of the team here
had to wade into save it before it got washed into the basin,
never to be recovered. “Thank you, Basim!” So it does a very good job of
representing small rivers. And the processes that happen
here are much more related to, say, a river than small laboratories. Obviously, in larger rivers
you have more scales of turbulence. But those scales,
they should be similar in our size. - I've seen a small scale model years ago,
when I visited the Bay Model in California. It's a 1:1000 scale
copy of the San Francisco Bay, which means it's the size
of a football field. But the 1960s engineers who built
it had to stick a load of copper strips into the base to make the water behave
like it would at full scale. By all accounts, they did really well,
particularly for before computers, but it's no comparison to having a model
that is closer to real-world size. - This summer we were looking at erosion
induced by a bank, an artificial bar we put in. Throughout the world
there's a problem in understanding how much erosion is going to happen
for a given flood. So as an engineer,
you want to be able to run a model that will tell you how much bank erosion
you'll have in the future. We would also, next year,
like to start looking at ice cover and the effect of ice on things
like bank erosion and floods. Because ice related flooding
is a huge problem. Having a river where you can model
ice would be quite unique. - A lot of this work can be done
with computer simulations now, but the code for those simulations
still has to be validated and checked somewhere like this. And sometimes the researchers here are working on things that there is
no computer model for, which surprised me. I assumed that simulating water
was pretty much a solved problem, but no. There are still new technologies
that need to be tested, and one of them is up there
getting the aerial shots for this video. - To model this river
with a particle interaction model would take many days,
months, years to run. We have projects involving large scale
particle image velicometry. This is a new technique with a drone,
you'll take the water surface and then you can have a velocity,
which you can then relate to a discharge: how much water is moving through a section
of river per second. And having a method of measuring discharge
without actually going into the river is very useful, because it's very difficult
to go into these rivers at high flows. It’s very dangerous, in fact. The water surface can be affected
just by the general wind, but then that can influence
or bias the results of the flow we actually want to measure. - And sure, by the grand scales of
waterparks and white water rafting centres, this isn't the biggest
artificial river in the world, but it is one that's built for research. Even if that does mean that
the team here wouldn't let me bring my own inflatable tube
to ride down it. Nobody has ever been down
on an inflatable tube. It's an interesting idea,
but I don't think I would advise it. I don't think I would advise it!"
i0RkEs3Xwf0,"Over the years I've been making videos, a lot of people have got in touch
to tell me that in Warsaw, in Poland, the tap water quality is tested
and controlled by clams. They said that the city constantly runs a sample of its tap water
past some mollusks. And those are filter feeders,
so if there's a contaminant in the water, they will instinctively close. Sensors attached to them
will detect that and raise the alarm. And I didn't believe it. It seemed too weird to me. And all the articles that I could find
about it seemed dodgy, somehow. They just set off red flags
in the research parts of my brain. There is a very arty Polish documentary
about the system, and a lot of sites repost that film’s claims
without even mentioning the source, just as a “look at this
funny thing off in Poland!”. It felt like it could be a misinterpreted
or mistranslated joke, or even a deliberate hoax by a filmmaker
that got out of control, and that the English speaking world was just believing it
because it was quirky and harmless enough. There have been plenty of fake
things like that spread about in the past, accidentally or otherwise. Or maybe the clam-sensors did exist,
but it was a brief experiment that never went anywhere. Well, I'm now here in Warsaw,
on a famous building in the middle of the river, with a Polish
speaking team showing me around. There is a lot of stuff we are not allowed
to film here for security reasons. Inside here is critical infrastructure. Plus, it is far too noisy down there
for me to talk, but I'm happy to report that yes,
the clams are real. They actually do protect Warsaw, but the story's a little more
complicated than that. IN POLISH: The important thing is: those clams aren't
the only protection. They're not even the main part. This is still a modern
water treatment system, with 21st century sensors and
detectors to keep everyone safe. This is part of a defense in depth,
one part of an early warning system, one more alarm that can go off, like an airport that uses
explosive sniffing dogs... but also electronic detectors. The technical term
for this is “biomonitoring”, and it turns out from more research that
this isn't the only place that does it. There are other water companies in Poland
that have similar setups, plus one in Minnesota, USA,
and probably more that I haven't found. At which point I think I can say that:
yes, the red flag in my head was wrong. The clams in this building
really do help protect Warsaw."
zCDIhq9nMBE,"- In 1986, the residents
of New High Street in Headington, near Oxford, woke up to find there was
a new addition to the road: a shark in the roof of number two. It was commissioned by
the owner of the house. It's protest artwork, anti-war, symbolic of bombs crashing
down into buildings. And of course, English planning
laws do not allow someone to suddenly install a
giant shark sculpture in their roof
in a residential area. At least, not without
consulting the neighbors first. - So in 1986, my dad put a 25ft fiberglass and steel shark through the roof of his house. He'd just bought his first house and the first night he moved in,
he heard planes going overhead, he was sort of woken by this. And in the morning
he read the newspaper and, I suppose, saw destroyed houses
in Libya that had been bombed. The story goes that my dad
and sculptor John Buckley were sat, drinking, celebrating,
the purchase of this house, sort of mulling over how to deal with
the shock of the bombing of Tripoli. They were up for a fight,
and they did this shark without planning permission, in secret. There was this sort of mixed reaction. A lot of people were shocked and didn't quite know
what was going on. I think some people thought
it might have been real which is an eyeopener and
certainly funny looking back. A lot of people just loved it
and thought it was brilliant, right from the word go. The council, obviously, were
very much ""not here, thank you, ""and certainly not without
planning permission, this is outrageous"". - So the months and years
after the shark was installed played out exactly as you would expect. The council said take it down.
The owner said no. It went to court. It took six years to resolve and the shark
was eventually allowed to stay when a senior British
government official intervened and said, ""Yes, this has
enough artistic merit that, ""as a one off, it can stay."" And now it's an icon of the area,
known around the world, and as far as I can tell, generally liked by the folks around here. Perhaps a bit more than the
current owner would like. Before we get to that though,
I did have a couple of more practical
questions about the shark. Like: does it have a head? - It doesn't have a head. It's just a half bust of a
shark crashing through the roof. I think they cut a crude
hole and dropped that in with a crane initially, and then sort of shored it up
as soon as they humanly could. There was no preparation, obviously,
because that would've tipped people off. It's fiberglass with steel reinforcement. The steel struts on the inside connect out through the ceiling and
down into the walls. So it's structurally connected.
It's there to stay. It needs repainting every now and then. And there's just continual
checking to make sure everything's in tiptop condition. - This year, thanks for a nomination from a presumably well-meaning
member of the public, the shark was put on the
local list of heritage assets. Now the shark isn't on the national list
of protected buildings yet. It could still be taken down
without breaking the law, but local registration
is often the first step to being on the national list. And owning a listed building
is a pretty significant burden. The local government requires you
to keep it in good condition and also keep it the same. And if you don't, they can fix
it themselves and bill you. Art, just like anything
else, requires upkeep. And there are news stories that show that over the last few decades, the shark, and this house, were
sometimes in extremely poor condition. - Drop a shark through
the roof of your house, there's some leakage problems that
one might immediately encounter! It turns out it's very
difficult to repair those. Until finally my mum ultimately stepped in and did the whole thing up to, I think,
quite a nice standard. Though I've been renting
it out as an Airbnb, it's just a lovely place
and it means a lot to me and I like that people can come and be
close to it and part of it too. So someone put it forward for the
Oxford Asset Heritage Register. On the council website, they say that
there's absolutely no restrictions placed. This is just for their record keeping. But they do mention that any
planning permission changes will necessarily take
this into consideration. I thought this was an
interesting take because, well, nominally this is here
to preserve this shark but this is controlled
through the planning laws. And seems to me you can't
really preserve something that's specifically
there to challenge that. That seems to be completely absurd.
And to miss sort of the artistic point, which is probably the thing
you would want to preserve, if you're preserving a piece of art! - As a bystander, I love art like this, where part of the work
is how it interfaces with the world and with bureaucracy. But for the local officials
it must be frustrating because they know that
anything they do to this shark becomes part of the art,
part of the story. List it, unlist it, demand its removal, demand its preservation,
deliberately ignore it, whatever they do, that's art now! I wouldn't want to be in that position. - So my dad passed away in 2019. We spoke a little bit about
the listing just before he did. He had sort of mixed feelings. On the one hand, he had
been fighting against the council for
a large portion of his life. And on the other hand, he
had these considerations about the legacy of the
place moving forward and liked that they
were acknowledging him. You've got this idea that
the council have come around and changed their mind
and are now embracing something they weren't before. And on the other hand, you've got this,
I think, slightly more truthful side, which is that these are
totally different councillors. The councillors that hated it
are all gone. And these new ones,
although they love it are applying the same kind of control, which again, flies in
the face of the piece. I guess there's a bit of conflict there. I wish he was still here to ask
and see how it all panned out. I think he'd like that we're still
talking about it today, very much. - For now, the shark is not
protected, not officially. In a few years... who knows?"
AcQifPHcMLE,"- This feels like an obvious thing to say, but: tanks are expensive, both to buy and to fuel. If you want to train someone to drive one, it'd be great if they
could learn the basics on a simulator first. So in the 1970s, the Swiss Army
had the idea to design and build tank simulators. But this was well before
computer-generated images. They couldn't create a virtual world.
So instead... ...they built a wonderful example
of 70s analog technology. The viewscreen in that box
is connected to a real camera and a real miniature
landscape through there. In the past, thousands and thousands
of tank drivers trained on machines like that. There's now only one
simulator left in the world and it's in the Swiss Military Museum,
about an hour north of Zurich. And tourists can try it. - There existed in the past, 12 simulators for
different types of tanks. It's very accurate for
teaching the basics, and teaching where to go with
the hand and with the feet. - Put that over your head. And then because in a normal tank
it's too loud with the motor noises, you have a special
microphone that goes around, - Throat mic!
- It's a throat mic. - So this goes on like... - This.
- Oh, that is... Okay, that's interesting. Yep. Okay. - Headset. - Okay. - Looks good. - Let's drive a tank. - Yeah, I wish you a good drive. - Thank you! Wow. Okay. All right, so. - So, I'm going to start the hydraulics. - Yep. Oh boy! Okay. [laughs] - Sounds good. Now, you can start the main motor. [motor revving] - Very well. Sounds good. - You can drive in the middle. - It's a tank. - Yeah, sure. You can go in the fourth gear. - Yeah. - That's the only one of the
Type 68 tank that's remaining and we managed to get it running here. It took roughly about
one and a half, two years. We had to really go into it
from ground-up. It was very difficult.
Not for everything, but mostly for the electrical
and electronic parts because it's old tech. It's not like you can go to
any supermarket and buy it. - Fifth gear. - There is a memory function
on the computer module which is based off this x and y axis,
says you're here, you're on gravel, you're on snow, you're on normal earth,
you're on road, and something like that. If you drive into a tree, the feet
where the camera sits on just moves up and it's like
you're having a panoramic ride above our model with a helicopter! - Okay, we can go... - Fifth gear, fifth gear. - The foot where you're driving on,
it's kind of a metal slide. If that moves a tiny bit. Or for instance, if there's
some contact with it and it moves, for instance, it needs to go up to go over that, it will notice that
and signalize the cabin that you're moving
over something. - The camera's original.
The foot is original. The whole model is original. Everything except for the
computer part is original, but it was too old and you don't
find parts easily for that. So we had to rebuild it
on a Raspberry Pi. - You can go into fourth gear
again if you're comfortable. - It is really dangerous what you do. Here, it's a game.
It's like a game. This job is not a game. - Thank you very much. - You're welcome. - [laughing] How do I get out of here?"
Ei6LKHNFpeE,"- I have a bit of a
history with monorails. Back in 2016, I visited the Wuppertal
suspended monorail in Germany, and I said that monorails are
almost always a bad idea. Monorail enthusiasts
sent me angry messages, but I stand by that. In 2020, I visited one of the last surviving
Roadmachines cargo monorails. They were actually useful and practical,
but they were temporary constructions designed for having cargo
hauled around work sites. And they've been replaced by modern
heavy construction equipment. Monorails are usually bad ideas, because the track has to be either
elevated or in a trench, and because switches at junctions
involve moving the whole track. In almost every case, a monorail is
a worse and more expensive idea than light rail, or a tram, or a bus. But. While I was researching
a while ago, I found a type of monorail
that is useful and practical and better than any
alternative for its job. And not only is it still in use,
new versions of it are being built. So I reached out to the
company that makes them and I asked them, ""Can I
have a go on one, please?"" This is the Monorack. - We build mainly ropeways.
That's our main business. Everything with the rope.
Aerial tramways, chair lifts, ski lifts. And Monorack is a Garaventa product
since nearly 45 years. In 1978 I think, or '79. Some two years after the petrol Monorack,
they start with electrical Monoracks. They installed mainly in the Alp area. Germany, Switzerland, a
lot of Monoracks in Italy, but also Canada, Sweden, Asia. All over the world we have more
or less about 800 Monoracks. The petrol Monoracks are mainly
installed in the agriculture area. The electrical Monorack usually is quiet, but here the customer made his own box. That's the reason why it's
still a little bit loud! - The invention that
makes this thing so useful is down on the track. This is a rack railway,
so the track has grooves and the cogs onboard
the train lock into it. That means it can climb
very steep hills like this and take tight corners
with no risk of slipping. Having just one lightweight rail
means it doesn't take up much room. It can go around tight corners
and it's easy to install. Being elevated, means it
can go over rough terrain and if there's rain or mud below,
it doesn't matter. I genuinely can't think
of a better solution for regularly, safely,
moving things up and down steep, rough terrain like this. - Every Monorack is based on a brake,
and on a engine chassis. And what's between the two chassis
is up to the customer, we can choose different models,
different chairs, whatever the customer needs or wants. You can see the charging rails. If the customer wants two or three, he can choose two or
three charging points. Normally we have only one,
in one of the end stations. - I know this sounds like an advert,
I promise it isn't. I just got actually properly enthusiastic
at being proved wrong. There are useful monorails in the world. And this? This is one of them."
yWYkoZKHLfg,"To make it easy to sychronise
the audio and video later. Except... that's not really an
answer to the question, is it? If the question was ""why do YouTubers
clap at the start of their recordings"", then yes, that's the answer,
it's to help with synchronisation. A lot of the time, audio and video
are being recorded separately. The microphone on my collar
is sending its signal to a small and very beaten-up recorder
that's clipped to my back pocket. The camera is recording its own sound too, and saving that as part of the video file
on its memory card, [muffled, through camera mic]
but it sounds terrbile. [back to main microphone]
So when I'm working on the edit and putting the two files back together, it's really useful to have
a short, loud, impulse sound at the start of both files, so I can synchronise them just by
looking for the spike on the display. There's a couple of extra complications
there, though. First of all: should that synchronisation be perfect? That camera is about two metres
away from me. The speed of sound changes
a little with temperature, but roughly, that's about
6 or 7 milliseconds. Not enough to care about here, but once you start putting
the camera further away, ten or twenty metres for long shots... that sound can take a couple of frames
to reach the camera and the audience. That would feel weird, so I'd have to slip the audio a little. That's why it's worth double-checking
the synchronisation by looking for the frame of video
where the hands touch. Plus, some cameras,
particularly old GoPros, actually add some sound delay
to the video file, their synchronisation is terrible. So if I've got three, or ten,
or a hundred different cameras all looking at the same thing, I can use that clap to
synchronise them all: get it close by looking
for the spike, confirm it by looking
at the hands. Actually, worst case, the audio can
actually be late by up to... maybe three frames or so? And the chances are no-one
will mind or even notice. Actually, the sound on this video
has been three frames late ever since I cut back
to this shot of me? If you did actually notice, well done,
I'll put it back to normal now. I suspect that works because brains
are used to correcting for small speed-of-sound lags for
people shouting from a distance, but that's just speculation,
I can't find research to back that up. And because the viewer might have things like a cheap external soundbar
on a television that adds more lag, it's best to synchronise
as close as you can. If the production's got a high budget,
they might use a clapperboard instead. That means the editor
has a record of which file is which take of which scene,
at the start, and they can sync up the audio
at the same time. But all that is still not
an answer to the question. It's the answer everyone gives, but it's not what the title of
this video is actually asking. This isn't ""why do YouTubers clap
at the start of recordings"", it's ""why do YouTubers clap
at the start of videos"". I've done that plenty of times before. I did it in this video. Why do we leave a bit of
technical junk in the video? Why do I set up a really nice shot
and then ruin it by showing the setup part, letting my camera fuzz about with autofocus, and make the whole video... worse? Well, I can't speak for everyone,
but my reason is: it sets the audience's expectations, and it makes it feel more authentic. When I'm filming on my own
with a static camera, it can sometimes look like I'm
just stood against a green-screen. But clapping, walking into frame,
letting the focus settle, showing that behind-the-scenes moment... it proves I'm here,
it makes me seem more trustworthy. For someone vlogging from their bedroom,
keeping those claps and the preparation in, letting the audience see a little bit
of the slip-ups and how it's made... it helps make a connection,
helps make them relatable. I don't need to be relatable. I don't really want to be relatable? But trustworthy. Trustworthy is good,
and leaving the clap and walk in the video establishes that I'm
one person with one camera, that I don't have a crew on this shoot, and that I am actually here,
wherever here is. Sometimes I'll leave that in
when I actually do have a crew. It's all about the aesthetics. Showing that setup,
leaving that synchronisation clap in, it's all about fitting
the message to the medium, planning not just what you want to say, but the subtext of how you say it, and handling all the subtle cues
that connect performer to audience and say, it's okay. You can trust me."
