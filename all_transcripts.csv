kwW3d1jgTlM,"I got five YouTube creators to compete against each other in this Albertson store. Each of them will earn points by competing in seven challenges. And the one who has the most points at the end of this video will win $200,000 for charity. Welcome to the first challenge. Oh my gosh. While wearing these goggles that give you almost no visibility at all, each contestant must make it to the other side of the aisle by walking on the floating cliff bars. If they fall off wall crossing, they will have to restart until they do make it across. The first person to make it across wins the highest amount of points. Also, one more thing I forgot to mention. The floor is lava. So, I'm going to take it slow and easy and just try to get to the finish line without having to reset anything. All right. Okay. Oh, shoot. Yeah. All right, baby. Let's go. I need to just drown everybody else out and just focus. I'm not going to win. I thought I had a strategy, but I guess my strategy was stepping on the lava. I'm so annoyed. Just a dumb mistake. I'm frustrated. All right, I got to pick up. I feel like they're behind me. Wait, did I make it? I made it. Oh my god. You got it. You got it. Wait, can I just jump? You can. Maybe. A cliff bar hates to see me coming. God dang. Oh my god. I only have two points. I have to come out first because if I don't, I'm going to be last. This next challenge might not be the fairest for some of the contestants. Oh my. Okay. Wait, there's a time limit. Look, 3 minutes. Next is the Zoa energy drink challenge. They will have 3 minutes to stack Zoa cans as high as possible. Whoever has the tallest tower at the end wins. You're so much taller. You have such an advantage. I can't even reach that wall. I mean, I'm both the tallest person here and a building creator. Yeah, you're This is going to be embarrassing. Sorry. My hands have been so shaky, too. This is not okay. Oh my gosh. They're all nice, but you know, I'm trying to win this. Oh my gosh. I think Sarah, she's playing this innocent card. If I just keep getting second place and Sarah doesn't get first place, we're in the lead. And that's good. We not really move that fast. You know what I mean? You go a little slow here. I should have played with more Legos as a kid. Oh no. Oh my god, that went by so fast. Oh my gosh, I did not expect that. Calm down. I'm literally shaking. Like, I need to just calm down and focus. I'm doubting myself, not going to lie. No. No. Dang it. Trying to decide whether to just keep it as is or try to put more on. I'm going to stabilize the base and if one of these guys get taller, then I'll add more on. 28 seconds. We have less than 30 seconds left. I can't go up anymore unless I just try to do one on the end. No, that's not good. That's not You know what? I'll take the L on this. I'll take the L. I'll take the L. I'll take the L. I'll take the L. Let mine go. I'll take the L. Let it go. It was You have to let it go, Rebecca. You can't keep holding it. Wait, it didn't. Oh my gosh, I feel terrible. Does that count? I won it until yours fell over and crushed mine. David should have had first place. Rebecca's tower fell into his and it made me have second place. Okay, sorry. It fell over there. Theirs was so much taller than mine. Like there was no way. Hey, it's okay. It's part of the game. And I feel like Beast Philanthropy is really setting that precedent for creators to help make the world a better place. Now that I'm in a space where I can actually compete on behalf of a charity. I can't believe that girl. There's no way. For this challenge, whoever presses their buzzer first gets a turn. There are 12 possible combinations, and you will each go one at a time. picking two numbers that will match the pictures behind and you'll receive two points for every combination you guess right. But if you guess wrong, you will lose two points. 17 and five. Yes. Yes. That's what we needed. I'm still second place. I'm still good. Sarah's the still the target. Uh 11 and 22. This challenge turned out to be more difficult than they expected. Oh no, I'm done. So, the contestants decided to work together to minimize the risk of losing too many points. If everybody wants to go, it'll still be rapid fire, but if no one wants to go, we'll have to go down the line. We have to go down the line and we'll sacrifice ourselves. 21 and 13. Oh, yeah. Good job. Good job. 17 and four. Nice. Oh my god. Sarah is so lucky. Five and 16. Oh, she got it. Wow. You got to definitely be in the finals. Oh my god. What the hell, man? Two and 18.

I'll I'll take one. I I haven't gone. She's like, I have so many points. Well, we said we were going down the line and I want to honor that. Sarah's the one to beat right now. I think we all should be looking at her and watching her because if it comes down to it, she's going to get so far ahead of us, we won't be able to catch her. 22 and 7. I love that. 22 and 14. I think she got it. She got it. I might be wrong. I don't remember. I don't remember. Seven of 14. Let's go. All right, I guess. No one else is happy. Okay. 20 and 22. Oh, the Okay. Okay. Six and 22. Nice. What? Unbelievable. How nice. Good job, Rebecca. That was That was rough. All right. I feel like these past challenges I've been doing so good because it's like a lot of skill. This is literally just kind of like guessing. I'm skiing. And you people. Now y'all get to give some. The contestants will now be playing Triscuit turntable. To uncover the secret phase, they'll each take turns to guess a letter. Every correct letter earns a spin on the wheel for extra points. If they guess the phrase correctly, they will win the game and earn 10 points. But every time they guess the phrase wrong, five points will be deducted. I'd like to buy a vow. I All right, let's see it. Let's see it. Come on. Oh. Oh. That's just one. Give me the eye. Give me five. 0 0 zero zero zero zero zero. I felt bad because for Kenigra we were like kind of uh like rooting for her to not get any points. I think all of the contestants are feeling nervous because all of these charities mean a lot to us. So all of us really want to win. Can I get an E? Oh, that's a good one. That's good. That's good. About that one. Oh, two. Oh my gosh. Give me points. Oh, no points. Zero. Zero zero 0. Someone's back there. If she gets another five, I'm quitting. Come on. Come on. No. Don't zero. Yes. All right. I'll take it. I'll take it. I'll take it. This is a high stakes competition. Logically, it would make sense to, you know, just not stress, but it's hard not to. I really want to show up and perform. S. No. S's. Crazy, dude. What kind of words don't have any S's in them? A. Give me the green. There we go. Give me two. Give me three. Oh my god. I'll take two. I'll take two. I got Come on. Come on. Oh, come on. Oh, that's two. That's a two. All right. Now, give me a five. And then I don't need any more points after this. Come on. Yes. That's what I want. That's what I want. Let's go. Thank you for that. I need I would like to guess. Whoa. Wow. Whole grain wheat. What? Coming into this, I genuinely thought I was going to be the worst contestant and I somehow I keep winning and I'm just so grateful. I honestly thought I was going to lose. No, you didn't. I was. So, call Sarah whole grain cuz she's on a roll. Cut that one off. Was S not a good choice? I like this. [Music] We said this. Who came? Someone guessed it. Yes, someone guessed it. The next game is sparkling ice bowling. Each contestant gets one shot to knock over as many pins as possible. The one with the most knockdown wins the challenge. This is a chance for anyone to take the lead. At any point, the tables can turn. I just need to make second place so that I can be in the final round. Negra. Good luck, Negro. Let's go. Oh my goodness. Oh, okay. All right. A bowling pin hates to see me coming. Here we go. I don't I don't want to get hit. Oh. Oh. Oh my. Are you freaking Your boy can't bowl. Is there anything else to say? I mean, if I were David, I'd be pretty disappointed. Becca, you have so nervous for her. Okay. I'm nervous right now. Oh, that's good. That was straight on. That was straight on. I like that. I like that. I wish I was stronger. It makes me want to like lift weights or something. Watch the strike. Watch this. It's going to be a strike. Oh gosh. So much fun. Yeah. The strategy to run. That's good. I like that. Strike. Not bad. Not bad. Yeah, this challenge I need to win or at least get second place if I want to even think about going to the final challenge. Here I go. Here we go. Bro's just stalling. That's not good. What? That's not good. That's not good. I thought the guys were going to dominate this challenge and I cannot believe that neither of them did well. The girls were feeling, you know, Yeah. For one of these contestants, winning $200,000 means more than you think because they are not competing for themselves. So, I'm competing for nourishing neighbors. They find the spaces where hunger exists and then work to provide food to those spaces to break the cycle of hunger. I'm going to be donating the money to American Cancer Society. I chose Sharing Excess. What they're doing is working with everyone that they can to make sure that the food that we just waste go to the people that needs it. I'm competing for Salvation Army. They help with the homelessness in America. The charity that I chose was Hope for Fertility. It gives grants to families who are unable to have children on their own. It's not about me. I have to win for the charity and for this cause. Sharing excess. I am going to win. Next up is the Uts Chip Taste Challenge. They will each be blindfolded and given five flavors to taste out of the 10 options that were provided to the contestants. a correct guess and you get five points, which means there is a possibility of earning 25 points in this challenge. It is now anyone's game. I feel the texture. This is sour cream. [Music] Watchmant a smell. You know, I don't think it was quite spicy enough to be red hot. So, I think I'm going to go with sweet heat barbecue. Dude, this is like a memory game. Okay. Hot honey. It's hot honey. This is the the sweet heat barbecue. I'm going to go with sweet heat. Oh my god. I'm going to go for one more. Sorry. I might be here all day just eating this. Tastes so good. I'm going to go with Hawaiian sweet heat on that one. Final answer. Another day, another disaster. Let's get after it. That's a pickle. If I've ever tasted one, I think it's fried dill pickle. The dill pickle one. That's fried dill pickle. Fried dill pickle for sure. 100%. This is my favorite challenge. This is my favorite challenge for sure. Cheddar sour cream. [Music] Oh, it's got some kick. Oh, dude. I'm going to go red hot. Red hot. I'm feeling very confident that that one is a red hot. I The crab chip. I don't What even is the crab chip? The crab chip. Yeah. Mike's hot honey. [Music] Now my mouth is burning. Maybe that was red hot. I don't know now. Honey barbecue. I feel like that last chip just blasted my tongue. I got to kind of I'm going to go with sour cream and onion. I don't remember, but it's the first sour cream that he said. Okay. I'm pretty sure that one's sour cream and onion. I'm going to go with the crab chip on this one. I actually feel pretty confident in this. It's It's been going well. Regular sour cream. Sour cream and onion for this one. I actually feel pretty confident in this. I'm gonna go with the crab chip. Salt vinegar. Damn it. Cheddar's sour cream. Final answer. That was harder than I thought. And with that, the finalists have been decided. Sarah will compete against Patrick in the final challenge for the $200,000 grand prize. But as always, there will be a twist. I'll be so so happy if I win because it means that I represented such a good cause and it means that I did something good for the world. I'm just excited. Every time the challenge starts, she's quickly analyzing and she's trying to throw everyone else off. Right now, don't pay attention to Sarah and whatever she says and try to beat her in the next challenge. We're almost there. Since I got to win, I might have to screw someone over. This is the Fastables decider. They are now playing for a massive $200,000 prize. No. There are two buzzers, split and take. If both contestants split, then the money is shared 50/50. If one chooses split and the other chooses take, the splitter gets nothing, and the one who chose take gets it all. If both press take, they walk away with nothing. The $200,000 will then be distributed between the other three contestants. What are you thinking here? I don't I don't know what I'm thinking. $200,000? I know. It's a lot. It's a lot. This charity is kind of close. I know. I heard your story. Near and dear to my heart. So, what made me say yes to doing this challenge is because of the charity that's involved with it. My dad passed away with liver cancer and it was horrible and I just want to give the money towards something that is near and dear to me. And I believe that, you know, hopefully with the money we could help try to prevent as many losses as we can. And um it's now or never. It's just so hard cuz it's like I know. I know. I I don't know what you're going to pick either though because it's like a part of me thinks that you would share it with me cuz you know how passionate I am about this, but a part of me is like after hearing your story like why would you not take it all? Right. I mean I did lose my dad to to this horrible cancer and uh I really want to like help this organization a ton. I've made my decision. We could lose it all. Okay. [Music] I knew you didn't think I was going to go. I'm so grateful. I'm so happy to be involved in this and was able to represent such a great charity. I'm so It's still just insane to me that I was able to I was able to win. Guys, we just got $100,000 to my choice of charity. This is insane. This is the least I could do to everybody that's suffering right now with cancer. And um it was all for my dad, too. You know, like what an insane experience. I'm so happy right now. We want to take a moment to say thank you to Beast Philanthropy and everybody else that's involved in this. We just found out that we get another $100,000 and instead of us taking that donation, we decided to split it amongst all the charities because they all matter equally. So, David, Kenigra, Rebecca, come in here. These are for you guys. These are for you guys. For all charities, this was by far the coolest twist ever. And to know that they decided to split it between the charities is something that I will never forget. I'm so happy that as hard as I lost out there, nourishing neighbors can still take a win. And I'm just so stoked to be part of this. I'm so thankful for Beast Philanthropy. I am just [Music] big thanks Beast Philanthropy. This was an amazing twist. This was amazing. Right. I want to give a special thanks to Albertson's for helping make this video possible as well as some other brands that stepped up in a major way like Cliff Bar, Zoa Energy, Halman, Best Foods, Triscuit, Sparkling Ice, UTS, and Fastables.

O6wTcrhkw4o,"In Ghana, sadly, countless children are abandoned and fall victim to being captured as slaves to the fishing industry. And after speaking with countless locals, I came to the heartbreaking realization that being rescued is only the beginning of their struggle. Even for those fortunate enough to escape, years of relentless abuse and exploitation have left them in desperate need of medical care. Yet, there are no adequate facilities to provide the treatment they so urgently require. So, we made it our mission to build a brand new surgical center in the heart of Ghana to combat the lack of medical care to help survivors like these two brothers, Ernest and Richmond, who were sold as slaves after being abandoned by their parents and only rescued at the age of 16. When our mom and dad give birth to us, we don't fight them and they leave us. As slaves of the fishing industry, the two were separated and had to survive on their own, not knowing if they will ever see each other again. Sometimes they will try to push you inside the water. If you don't know how to swim, then you are going to die. 20 of my friends, they all die. But luckily, the two brothers were rescued by the Ghana Make a Difference Foundation, also known as GMAD, an organization that combats child slavery here in Ghana. I was very happy that I come to GMAD because what they have done to me, I'm appreciate of that. As it stands, GMAD serves as a shelter for these abused and orphaned children by breaking the chains of their past and providing them a life of love and care. The goal is to rehabilitate and educate them so that when they grow out of adolescence, they are capable of making a new life for themselves. When the brothers were saved, they luckily did not need any medical attention, but this was not the case for many of their peers. So, to find out more, I met up with Austin, the executive director of GMAD, who explained the issue with medical care for the survivors that need it. They have to travel to an overcrowded hospital 30 minutes away from the GMAD compound and wait in long lines of over 600 people. The bottleneck's always been O space. We've never had enough O space. You know, the volunteer surgeons here will perform over 200 major medical operations in 4 and 1/2 days. After seeing so many people wait in line the whole day only to be denied treatment, we immediately began the construction of a new surgical center in the GMAD compound. While the project was underway, I spent more time with the kids and got to see the abundance of life here at the compound. [Music] I'm so happy I met Mr. I was just in shock, but luckily I met a celebrity here one day. The kids that come here to gone to make a difference, they own their stories and it's really powerful because of what they've went through and what they've overcome. Seeing all the warm smiles on each of these children's faces, one could never have guessed that they come from such devastating backgrounds. If it wasn't for Cory and Stacy Hoffman, who founded GMAD 12 years ago, none of this would have been possible. When we first came to Ghana, we realized that there were so many children that had no one to advocate for them. Children need families to thrive. As the construction of the surgical center was nearly complete, we sat down with some of the volunteer surgeons to hear more about their experiences. I think yesterday when we showed up, we had probably around 600 people here begging to be seen. And so, it only takes one time to see that and to not come back. The doctors and surgeons that volunteer to help here often see cases that are so severe they've literally never seen it before in their entire career. You see, you know, we have 60 individuals here that are volunteering their time. They pay their own way. They come back and they want to come back because they feed off the energy of the people and the the manner in which they are so resilient and they overcome. That's what's infectious is watching the people just deal with the hand they've been dealt and and make the best of it. So, after months of construction, we had finally finished building GMAD's new surgical center, and it was now time for the big reveal. In the name of Almighty God, the Son, the Holy Spirit. Amen. With this new surgical center, GMAD will now be able to provide treatment to more children and families of the surrounding community. Now, we have the ability to perform surgeries to folks that need it. [Music] After the grand opening, the folks at GMAT held a celebration outside their newly built surgical center. And the very next night, they were able to save one of the very first patients to be treated in this facility, a young girl named Mary, whose legs were so deformed that she could barely walk. But luckily for her, the New Beast Philanthropy Surgical Center provided the surgeons an adequate facility where they could fix her legs. Mary will be one of many whose lives will change for the better now that the surgeons at GMAD have more capacity to help others. If you'd like to be a part of the incredible work that GMAD is doing, I need you to click the link in description and donate right now. Seriously, with your support, GMAD will be able to get more kids out of slavery and provide them with the love and care they deserve. Go away, Wasp. I'm trying to help people. You should consider it. It would mean a lot to them, and it would honestly mean a lot to me. I also want to say a special thanks to Ox Blue for donating the time-lapse cameras we used in this video. You guys are awesome.",unknown

wOGD9zfqEkk,at least once in our lives we have felt out of place with those around us but for some being different from others is a NeverEnding reality people with intellectual and developmental disabilities such as autism and down syndrome experience life with a unique perspective and are often made to feel left out by Society although they may be seen as different by others these people are still human beings yet many of them will never have the opportunities that most of us are able to have which brings us to Dream Ride a weekend that provides people with intellectual and developmental disabilities a safe space where they can be themselves without feeling different so I sent Kiren from Beast philanthropy to Connecticut to find out more about this event and that's when we came across jelly and action my name is jelly had I love my mom she's the best friend when jelly was born all I wanted was to find a community where I knew she would be accepted I'm just filled with so much gratitude gratitude for communities like this I mean someone caring and taking the time out of their own schedule to do something like this that would make anybody a little emotional I love you I love that song [Music] too this 3-day event has many exciting features for everyone to enjoy such as live music and a variety of activities although this all looks super fun none of it compares to the main attraction of the weekend the dream cruise but before we get into that let's go back to how this all started meet Mike a local here in Connecticut who started dream ride back in the year 2000 Dream Ride started out very small 24 years ago and from there it's been an incredible journey initially Dream Ride consisted of a few people who would take children with intellectual disabilities on bike rides this small act of kindness had a huge huge impact on these children's sense of importance and selfworth and naturally the support for Mike and his dreamr initiative grew exponentially as the years went by it's their free space this is the place where they come and they're respected it doesn't matter who you are what you are where you came from everybody's the same and that caring feeling to make a day better for someone else it's uh definitely an [Music] experience the the support that dream ride receives today is so incredible and inspiring but unfortunately people from other countries might not be able to experience a weekend such as this one so we decided to do something special we've sponsored Some Dream Riders from all over the world some are coming from Europe the Philippines and we wanted to bring them here so they could experience this dream ride event we then met with one of our sponsored individuals named Jack my name is Jack H and I from Devon in south ham I love this place and E that dream come true we just met Jack and he is just hands down the most incredible human being such a warm heart he's just a very very cool dude riding a Supercar is Jack's biggest dream so we wanted to make sure this dream came true I'm so excited to be driving with him we're going to take out one of the McLarens and we get to do the dream cruise together and that's going to be so much fun to spend more time with him now it was time for the two to go on the dream cruise together everyone here has a heart 10 times as size of a normal one the state police close the streets and everybody here is consistent with a heart to make something better for them woo here we [Music] go oh I'm too nervous I don't want to crash into we're so close to everybody speci family be proud yeah good I'm sure they are proud after embarking on the Dream Cruise the Riders are brought back to the festival where they are LED on a red carpet into the main tent the expression on each of their faces shows how happy and important they are made to feel by such a caring community of [Music] people the sense of family amongst everyone is what brings them all together and their experience of the weekend gives them all hope of a life without feeling different and neglected as they so often are made to feel by others a truly beautiful moment that brings joy to each of them and their family's [Music] Hearts thank you guys for watching this video click the link in description if you want to support dream Riders and allow more people in the future to be able to attend this event for these kids it can truly be life-changing and uh I'll see you guys in the next video philanthropy [Music],unknown
CvPtDd3B3PE,"I don't think we've ever done a more difficult and heartbreaking [Music] project for the first time ever it truly was a matter of [Music] life and death this is Dr shun founder of hospitals for Humanity and the saving little hearts program they are on a mission to provide life-saving surgeries to children in Nigeria who suffer from heart disease the current sole purpose of hospitals for Humanity is to treat as many children with congenital heart disease as possible heart disease stems from struck throat and then that child would now have to have some type of surgery and unfortunately children in Africa they're just not getting the the level of care that other children around the world are getting all these children just need so much help and hospitals for Humanity is doing their best to provide that but they can only do so much with the resources they have once we heard about the work Dr shagun and his team at hospitals for Humanity were doing my friends Tash and Kirsten from Beast philanthropy flew to Nigeria to see how we could help the team drove to DED Hospital in Lagos to meet with Dr shagun Who then introduced them to all of the children awaiting their surgeries some of these children waiting may never receive the procedures they desperately need unfortunately there's always going to be a percentage of children on our list that will not get the surgery we know that going in due to widespread poverty across Nigeria many hospitals lack the necessary equipment they need in order to treat life-threatening medical conditions one of those conditions being congenital heart disease a group of heart defects present at birth that affect the heart structure and blood vessels if left untreated these conditions can cause some serious complications later in life and sometimes lead to death it is the most common birth defect affecting one in every 100 children worldwide so with the help of our partners from outside the box Capital we decided to help Dr shagun and hospitals for Humanity save 100 children's Hearts which include conducting open heart surgeries device closures cardiac catheterizations and screenings for CHD without the proper care they can not wake up the next day we've heard stories from doctors where they've called the families to say we can bring them in today and they had passed away the night before so hearing about these stories that people are losing their children and it can happen so quickly and without the services that hospital for Humanity provides some of these families will never see their children grow it really is a matter of life and death um we have a pain in my [Music] heart but after this surgery I'll be better I will go and comat a able God is a very peculiar case he came to us in 2019 at one of our screening programs and we knew that we had to do something immediately for him because his situation was Dire so we did the first part of his surgery back in 2019 and since then he has been thriving but despite AEL God's successful surgery back in 2019 he is still at risk and needs one more surgery to complete his treatment having these heart conditions forces the children to face everyday challenges but they are not the only ones whose lives are affected I'm the mother of able God most at times it was not easy because his condition was so bad I never knew what to do these heart conditions affect more than just the child you've got these mothers who are having to give 24-hour care to these sick children and that causes so much strain because of these parents' love for their children they will go to Great Lengths to try and give them a better life like this mother and father who drove 9 hours to reach DED hospital so their son Giovani could undergo the surgery he desperately needed jaavan having this surgery done will really mean a lot and it will give us greater opportunities the first thing I want to do is to dance and move my body I want to be better to many of these patients these surgeries give them a new opportunity and make such a positive impact in their lives in the lives of their families to see the lasting effect these operations have Tash and Kirsten visited treasure who underwent heart surgery as part of the hospitals for Humanity program back in 2016 before his operation treasure was constantly weak and fatigued he was often in the hospital and the state of his condition was not improving at all his mother had to work multiple jobs in order to pay his medical bills with almost nothing left over each time but after meeting Dr shagun and undergoing his heart procedure under the care of the hospitals for Humanity program Treasure's Health drastically improved before he knew it he was back at school and was even healthy enough to play soccer with his friends currently treasure is focusing on his education and wants to go to college to get a degree while his mother is pursuing her career as an entrepreneur even owning her own business we are ready to take every tax every challenge every Target every goal to the next level we have the opportunity now we have life back at DED Hospital a 13-year-old boy is brought into the operating room for his open heart surgery his name is marvelous the child we are operating on today he has a congenital heart defect that means he has a hole in his heart and the blood flow to his lungs is narrowed my name is Mrs Rose maros is the only song that I have I'm having a little [Music] doubt but that little boy will say no mommy I'll be okay don't worry as the operation is conducted Marvel's mother nervously waits for him to return praying for a successful operation in hopes of a new life for her and her son after some time Marvel's operation was completed but something wasn't right and he was rushed to the Intensive Care Unit there a lot of issues for the SK because the heart was very po to begin so this morning when we met with the doctors they actually said that his operation ended up being a lot more complicated than expected and they were actually quite concerned that he wouldn't make it but this morning we visited him in ICU and you could just see how sweee his recovery had been and how quickly he' bounced back I want to thank you people for what they doing for suar helping them to do what they one time desire in despite the concerns of his condition after the procedure was completed marvelous made a healthy recovery and the surgery was a success after sometime in the hospital he will be able to live a better life at his lungs now receed the required oxygen needed in order for his heart to function properly may God bless you all I really appreciate for making this surgery to be successful I'm so grateful I'm so so grateful unfortunately for Abel God and his mother him receiving his operation isn't going to be as easy as they thought we were hoping that we will be able to complete his surgery for this program but unfortunately we weren't able to the doctors told me that what they are planning for is is to fly him out of the country so that they will do it in the better way that he will survive Giovani is similar to Abel God where his surgery is so complicated that they have to look for another hospital in order to provide that surgery so doing more funding to be able to get him the care that he needs as mentioned earlier in this video many of these patients would not have required heart surgery if not for preventable conditions like untreated strep throat long term group a strep infections can lead to rheumatic heart disease which causes up to 350,000 deaths annually which is why light AI has developed an incredible AI based technology that simplifies the diagnosis of group a strep making it more accessible and easier to diagnose these life-threatening complications that can be prevented with something as simple as a course of antibiotics this Innovation could save countless lives

6DJBExeh94w,"around a 100,000 Americans passed away in 2023 from a disease that almost no one understands America is facing a record high number of addiction places over 48.7 million Americans are living with substance use disorder and millions more directly and indirectly impacted I'm an addict if I have a drink I can't stop everyone's safety is at stake it is an uncontrolled fire someone close to home offered to give us a more personal perspective on addiction my name is Dan and I'm an addict and alcoholic and I have been in recovery for the last 11 years Dan started working with Beast philanthropy as the chief creative officer almost 2 years ago and during his continuous hard work to make these films he still suffers with his addiction on a daily basis the hardest part is remaining clean having to constantly remind oneself like life can look so great from the outside but it's a it's a daily um struggle and it's forever but that's why we say just for today so Dan and I we've been working together a little bit over a year and a half I've learned spending so much time with him where I've completely changed my mind about what an addict is when we heard about Phoenix a program that uses new methods to help members return to a sober life with a high success rate of recovery where eight in 10 active members remain sober I really wanted to go there with Dan to learn more about this to be honest before I came here I said to Darren like I don't know how to feel about this I was still very on the fence with this idea but I think that's changed after speaking to Scott founder of The Phoenix Program I'm Scott Strode I'm in recovery and I'm also the executive director and the founder of the Phoenix Scott started the Phoenix as a result of his past struggles with alcohol and substance abuse his experience of turning his life around was sparked from converting his bad weekend habits into a healthy active lifestyle surrounded by like-minded people my own addiction story started from the environment I grew up in through sober events and activities members Bond over who they want to become strong in mind and body we realized we couldn't get to enough people that needed support and so we opened up the chance for folks to volunteer to start Phoenix and that's when we really grew to scale a lot of Phoenix happens outside of buildings out in the community with bike rides and runs and Hikes and other things I think this the Phoenix and places like this that exist it's very new age maybe it is a way in which recovery can work it's a beautiful thing we sat down with Jessica and Tiffany who turned to the Phoenix for their own recovery and now find meaning from helping others find theirs I was really hopeless depressed I knew I needed help but I hid my disease from my family no one knew I had a problem because I didn't live at home I was using much harder drugs I had no more like reservations and addiction and my life got really dark it took 2 years of me really going on a merry go round of substances I picked up heroin again and I overdosed and my biggest fear is losing my son I can't imagine being without me and I don't want to fail him I was homeless in the streets of Boston so I went to wake up the guy that was next to me and he didn't move for like 30 seconds in that really short frame of time I thought to myself like oh my goodness he's dead and like he woke up he was fine but just very quickly I turned it around on myself the final thought was I don't want to die I can't be alone in a place and know that everything's going to be okay I'm knowing you're strong enough to do that you're going to have to find someone in the same position as yourself and you guys are going to have to try to figure that out to get that and that's why this program exists I had been in treatment for so long and I always had to say Jessica I'm an addict Jessica I'm an addict Jessica I'm an addict and I felt that I would always have to be known as that and I became became really ashamed of myself but walking into the Phoenix and they told me just introduce yourself however you want it changed everything for me I I became really proud of myself I wasn't ashamed I didn't feel like I had to walk around with a Scarlet Letter I did this workout and I had um confidence that selfworth that like feeling of belonging you can feel like this without using drugs I know I'm an addict I know what I did on that never forget my past but I don't always have to be known for that either and and the Phoenix gave me that back I claim my name back that same feeling that we chased that same feeling that I chased for so many years um has been right here we have an ethos here at the Phoenix is that we're here to lift each other up so you come in and Phoenix is for you in the beginning and then you realize you can use your unique gifts to help others heal on their path and that's real Community that's how we help each other Rise is through Community it is through volunteers like Jessica and Tiffany that the Phoenix has reached and helped hundreds of thousands of people in their recovery through facilitating an environment built around Fitness love and Community led by like-minded people all these people from all these different walks of life all share one common problem and they get to hope it each other out with that problem every single day and that's a beautiful thing through our time at Phoenix it's become so evident that addiction could be affecting anyone around us but luckily there are amazing communities like Phoenix that are making successful strides in providing a solution this program is free but raising money is a constant struggle one thing we're trying to raise money for right now is our digital app Millions around the world struggling with addiction can't find the help they need this app can change that but we need your support to make it a reality so with our partners from Stand Together We wanted to help Scott and his team in any way we can so for every person that comments on this video Together We rise we will donate a dollar to The Phoenix Program we'll also be matching every donation 2 to one up to $200,000 and together with stand together we will be donating $50,000 directly into the fund to help fund the app so Phoenix can reach those in need around the world where there's breath There's Hope and now that's how I see the addiction crisis everybody that's part of it can actually be part of the solution too Tiffany's story really inspired us and we wanted to show it after a long road of substance abuse and through her determination and sobriety Tiffany had found her passion I had been doing CrossFit for 2 months I was hooked I was hooked into the community the atmosphere the open I used CrossFit as my therapy Tiffany had a natural gift for CrossFit and through all her training was finally given the opportunity to compete in a competition that only the top 40 CrossFit athletes in the world can compete at but attending this event is expensive and she has had to find a way to fund this journey herself we were so moved by her unwavering determination to support those around her that we felt we needed to do the same for her the competition that you have coming up yeah um we're going spons to you we'll pay all of the expenses for you to go oh my goodness thank you so much that's going to be huge I want to say thank you to stand together you guys have been an incredible partner like us stand together is dedicated to giving people

2n5h3VFdxSE,"what if I told you you could help tens of thousands of people live a better life without ever leaving your couch by just clicking on a thumbnail and watching a video you can help provide electricity to Villages rebuild entire towns and save rhinos from Extinction it's because of every one of you supporting the Beast philanthropy channel that we were able to accomplish all of this in 2024 we kicked off the Year by traveling to a secluded Village in Guatemala called cheezy Guan the people of this remote Village struggle with the basic necessities of life like clean water safe housing and proper education not to mention powerful storms that can destroy their handbuilt rudimentary homes we want to come and help this community we want to make a big difference for them so in Just 4 days we built 15 new houses that are fully equipped with everything these people need to live much more comfortably and it was finally time for these people to move into their new homes let's cut the r on top of that we also built a community center providing additional classrooms for the school as well as facilities that can be used to teach the women of the village new skills to support their families and [Music] Community next up we headed to Mexico where we worked with Operation Smile to provide Aid to people born with a cleft lip and pallet every year over 200,000 children are born with these conditions leading to many problems eating breathing and talking worst of all these kids face bullying and isolation from other children people of Rural and poor communities often receive little to no treatment at all we wanted to help so we partnered with Operation Smile to pay for 100 surgeries they're going to be having a life change Forever After the procedure is completed many of these children will be able to smile for the first time our patients are going to have the opportunity to actually have a normal life the Beast philanthropy team then flew out to Nepal and traveled to the remote Village of clagon after a warm welcome we found out more about the problems these locals face due to their isolation this community has no electricity meaning that local doctors have no access to proper medical equipment if more complex care was needed it would take hours to walk to a better medical facility Darren met up with a local give power engineer named Sanjay who told him a tragic story about Nera she had to travel in the Monson roads and then since the Bing Center was far away she couldn't reach to the biring center and had to lose the baby and due to a lack of government funding this Hospital would not get electricity until at least 2030 together with our partners give power and the green program we installed a solar power system and batteries to power the hospital as well as provide the equipment needed to create a safe and modern birthing center together with the community we turned a broken building with no electricity into a fully operational hospital that will service over 16,000 people in this community later that night the whole village came to the hospital to witness the lights turn on for the first time are you ready 3 2 1 seeing the lights come on for the first time in a community it never gets old over the year we completed three projects in Africa starting off in Uganda where hundreds of thousands of local people in rural Villages live in extreme poverty most of these people live off of as little as1 or $2 a day meaning getting an education starting a business receiving adequate health care or even electricity is nearly impossible to help alleviate this problem we teamed up with give directly to dispense cash grants directly to hundreds of families in a community to give them a chance to lift themselves and their families out of the cycle of generational poverty they had been trapped in when cash goes to a community even business in that Community is boosted this cash enables them to go for their needs together with give directly we were able to fund around 300 local families with a cash Grant equivalent to what they would earn in a typical year for hundreds of years going back these people have not had opportunity but now moving forward they have opportunity and they can now build a stronger future not just for themselves but for the generations that follow next we traveled to Zambia and visited our friend Dora from one of our previous projects 5 years ago she moved to mapapa along with four adopted children and started making Tik Tok videos to raise money to build a school and Village for kids in desperate need and very quickly her account grew to over 4 million followers and she now cares for almost 400 children but despite her best efforts the cost of supporting all these kids is an ongoing Challenge and along with many other problems they were facing Dora's Village was still in need of basic necessities so we got to work and put in a well for fresh drinking water bought Dora a brand new car so she wouldn't break down on her long Journeys for supplies installed internet so she can continue making content to generate the funds needed to support the kids tripled their solar capacity and rebuilt a dormatory that was destroyed in a devastating storm so as of today this house will no longer be called the boy's house it will be called the be philanthropy every one of us has the ability to make a difference in somebody else's life next we went to Kenya where we visited the Mara and met up with the local Rangers that protect the endangered Wildlife lack of electricity and monitoring equipment have made their jobs far more difficult and dangerous we met with Daniel the CEO of the mesai conserves to learn more about the challenges they face the downfall in the mara all started 60 years ago when the land was divided and given to the Masai people for private ownership this led to investors buying the land for development and exploitation of resources many Masai had no choice but to accept the money abandoning their ancestral heritage and putting the habitat that millions of Masai and animals rely on at risk of being destroyed to combat this problem the conservancies came up with environmentally friendly revenue streams that could be used to lease the land from the landowners so that it could be conserved and protected for the MSI people and the animals to help the Massi conservancies we worked with give power to provide the ranger stations with clean renewable energy so they never have to work in the dark again we also provided them with enough funds for seven new weather stations which now collect data needed to generate carbon credits to fund the expansion of the MSI Conservancy this project allows them to have a sustainable source of income to continue their work and keep the mara as it was for centuries those people who are considered as custodians of wild animals are now benefiting because it is actually providing income to thousands and thousands of households we're also ensuring that the new generations will have to continue what we have started after tens of thousands of requests we finally made our way to India starting in New Delhi for not one but two projects first Darren met with Dr Modi the founder of the Udan care program where orphaned and abandoned children are given a loving and caring environment to give them a fair chance at a life different to the one they were born into we were so moved by the exceptional work of Udan care that we decided to fund all operating costs for the shelter in new daily for a year as well as pay for 280 scholarship after we wrapped up that project Darren traveled to Kolkata for the most heartbreaking project we have done to date where young children work up to 14 hours a day collecting scrap in dangerous landfills in the the hopes of salvaging enough scrap to buy a bowl of rice without access to an education these children have no hope of a future Beyond these trash dumps it is because of a nonprofit called tala shed that tens of thousands of underprivileged children have been rescued from the dumps and are now getting an education and a chance at a better life to help tiljala expand their operation and create more opportunities for these children we funded the entire tiljala shed program for the whole year while we were working with tiljala we learned that many of these children come from homes where there is not enough food to eat a single meal every day so Darren called some of his old friends who agreed to fund a food program for at least 2 years and then another huge shout out to Tony and Sage Robbins who saw the video and immediately pledged to fund the entire program for an additional year as well as extend the food program for two additional years now is a great time to mention something else on almost every project we've done the organizations we highlight get incredible support from around the world when people see the outstanding work they do and the difference they make this is one of the ways we make a much bigger difference than just what is shown in this video and we couldn't do any of this without you while we were in India we launched another project with a toy company called play Shifu they make incredible educational toys and donated $1 million Worth to give to underprivileged children around the world the kids really enjoy playing with these toys without even realizing that they are learning I wish I had stuff like that when I was in school is going to go on to bless 190 pediatric cancer Warriors thank you guys so much we are so happy thank you thank you thank you so much this year we managed to complete four projects in America five if you count the more than 20 million pounds of food we distributed to food insecure people across the country but that is an ongoing project and we didn't make a video it's really kind of crazy when you think about it for years ago we started with a goal of Distributing 400,000 meals a year now we're doing over 20 million and we are aiming to double it again next year the first video in America was with our long-term Partners at electric ebikes W together we gave away over 600 electric bikes across the country to people who needed transportation to get to school work medical appointments and just have reliable transportation thank you Mr be cuz now I I won't be standing Ste I'll be slowly moving forward to the next goal in my life we then visited a nonprofit school in Atlanta where the kids sing and dance in class Ron and Kim the founders of this amazing school have discovered a different way to interact with kids that actually makes education fun they have taught their method to over 100,000 teachers around the world and the results are always the same incredible so we decided to partner up with stand together and victra to pay for over 200 teachers from around the country to visit the Ron Clark Academy in Atlanta so that they could take this program back to their own schools when you affect the life of a child you do not only affect the life of that child everybody that one day that child's life will have an impact upon every teacher needs to realize it could be in the millions of lives but really we just want to make great people who love others and want to use their talents to make a difference in the lives of the people that they're around for the next project we traveled to Texas where we met up with David you visualize the last time you wish you didn't wake up David was an NFL star who found a stronger purpose helping people who had suffered catastrophic injuries adapt to their new lives this was one of the most inspiring videos we have ever done I was presented with the opportunity to come to the Adaptive training Foundation it was life-changing I don't believe there's anything that you can't do you just have to find an adaptable way to do it understanding the adversity these people had faced and seeing them overcome a devastating and permanent injury only to become stronger and more confident is a great lesson to all of us for when we are faced with adversity together with stand together we donated $250,000 to ATF so David can help more people as well as train more coaches to spread his program across the world we we're not going to make this gym about changing the world for them we wanted to change them for the world and for our last project of 2024 we traveled to Tampa Florida to work with an organization who are literally giving people their smiles back severe dental disease robs people of their confidence their health and worst of all their smiles which are such an essential form of human interaction and it was a certain picture that I looked at like this is not me like a smile to me means a lot I've had little kids point out going Mommy what's wrong with her mouth I mean it's embarrassing I don't have any pictures with milestones in my kid' life because I wouldn't smile and I would me on camera nuvia dental implants donated a million dollar in services to give 20 patients a million new reasons to smile our goal is to not only put smiles back on the faces of these patients but to leave a smile on the faces of every single person we come into contact with on these projects on behalf of everyone at sharing excess thank you thank you thank you thank you

gvb5gI_IOpw,"Before we get into this video, something extremely serious happened close to home. Hey guys. Well, a few months ago, I landed up getting very, very sick. I spent some time in the hospital and I'm going to be stuck at home for a few months while I recover. So, I'm not able to travel, which is not a bad thing because now you get to meet some of the other people that work for Beast Philanthropy. And really, you're going to understand after you've met them why we are such an effective and efficient charity. It's the people that make up the organization. Every single person that works for us is completely dedicated to helping other people and giving as much as they can. Today, you're going to meet Nick. Nick is one of the sweetest, most humble, kind people you're ever going to meet. But Nick's also a really famous musician. He's got the lifestyle that I think all of us wish that we had. And Nick walked away from all of that to come and work for the philanthropy and help us serve. He's such a good guy. We're all convinced that the office at Nick is short for unicorn. Um, and you're about to find out why. What if I told you up to half the global population is affected by oral disease, resulting in many, if not all of them losing their teeth for reasons including genetics, trauma, and medication. And while society often associates a person's value and attractiveness directly to their appearance, this grapple with one's self-esteem could mean heart-wrenching barriers between them and living a fulfilling life. Having a new smile for many of these people is much more than a cosmetic solution. I like to take pictures. All right, let me be honest. I love to take pictures of myself and I like to be out there. I like to sing. I like to, you know, I just like to deal with people. When I started losing teeth, I just didn't understand cuz I'm like, I brushed my teeth. I flossed my teeth. What is wrong? I'm doing everything I'm supposed to do. But I'm finding out that that's not all you need to do. I went back and started looking at my pictures. I never not like what I see when I look at myself. And it was a certain picture that I looked at and it just it just it just blew me. My whole mind was like like this is not me. like a smile to me means a lot. That's what I wanted back more than anything. Like Darlene, we also heard the stories of many other people around the country who are all facing their own unique challenges with their teeth. And we learned that for most of these people, this is not self-inflicted. Um, I'm a mom of two boys, a single mom of two boys. I got married in 1995. Um over the course of about 28 years um my husband abused me. Um would knock out my teeth, break bones. So I over the course of the last 20 years, I have had no teeth. And it's embarrassing. You don't want to smile. You have to work. But people look at you and they're like, ""Oh."" I've had little kids point out going, ""Mommy, what's wrong with her mouth?"" I mean, it it's embarrassing. I don't have any momentum, any pictures with milestones in my kids' life because I wouldn't smile and I wouldn't be on camera. It uh breaks my heart to hear how something as simple as a smile is depriving so many people of expressing who they truly are. So, to give them an opportunity for a second chance at a better life, we sent Nick, one of our beast philanthropy team members, all the way to Tampa, Florida to meet with an organization that could help. I've just arrived in Florida. I'm super excited about representing Beast Philanthropy on this project. Smiling is something we all do to show expression. It's to show happiness. And it breaks my heart to think that these candidates haven't been able to do so or feel any less than they should be. When he arrived, he met with Taylor from Nuvia Dental Implant Center. People come to us and their teeth are so bad that they all need to be extracted. They all need to be taken out and they can need to get brand new teeth. But traditionally, the old way of doing this, it usually can take somewhere up to 10 months sometimes to get your permanent teeth. And Nuvia, what's so incredible is through over 10 years of research, development, a lot of work that went into making a system where we can give people permanent teeth in 24 hours after surgery. When we witnessed the changes that Nuvia was making to tens of thousands of people with oral imperfections, we decided to partner with them to give Joanie, Darlene, and 18 other people around the country a brand new set of permanent teeth. You can't be so so blessed to be able to tell you that today. Thank you so much. We're all brought up being told to never judge a book by its cover, but we live in a world where the people in magazines are smiling. It's how we as human beings express happiness. And I'm really excited with the help of Nuvia and their incredible team. They were able to give these people the opportunity to feel like they can be happy again. Something that I don't think they have felt in a long, long time. When Taylor took me around the facility at Nuvia, one of my biggest takeaways was just how friendly the staff was and how accepting they were of all the patients that were there. Taylor also introduced Nick to Dr. Anoni, the surgeon who would be conducting three of the 20 operations. I think it's easy to look at what Nubia does as giving people teeth, but really it's so much more than that. We're giving people their life back. We're giving people their health back, their relationships back. It's such a blessing to be a part of an organization that does so much to change people's lives. One patient who is extremely excited for his operation is Brent. Over 19 years ago, I had uh been um diagnosed with sepsis after it entered my body. So, they had me take antibiotics for a year after that. Began to eat away at my my dental work. Uh that uh is now the reason that my mouth is in the shape that it's in. Brent needs surgery to walk again, but he cannot undergo an operation until his dental health is restored as it can be a significant complication in his recovery. I have two little grandsons, one's five and one's seven, Dylan and Finn. They're the joy of my life. I love him so much. But my little grandson, whenever I go to his house or they come to my house, first thing that little Dylan does, he tries to find my canes. because he thinks if he can find my canes, he's going to teach me how to walk. Because he said, ""Papa, we know you can walk. You just got to believe in yourself, Papa. If you just give me your canes, I'll help you walk. I'll hold your hand and we'll I'll teach you how to walk again."" Brent wants nothing more than to be active with his family, but a dental implant is too expensive for him to afford on his own. [Music] You want to be, you know, you you want to be strong. You want to be the leader that you know you can be. And you want to be able to um not have respect but earn respect. And um my younger brother used to have a turtle and we could always tell when the turtle wasn't feeling good cuz he could go into a shell. and I just felt like I've been sort of a turtle with my head on my shell. My daughter three days ago uh had a little baby girl. We have two grandsons now. We have a baby granddaughter. I'm looking so forward to being able to come home with a a set of teeth and see my granddaughter for the first time with a big open smile and not a new chapter but a new novel that I can write in her life. I see a whole new book coming out. When the rest of the patients started to arrive for their consultations, we noticed all of them had a loved one to support. But sadly, because of work commitments, Joany's best friend, James, was not able to make it. He wish he could have been here, but he couldn't. And we've been friends for over 40 years. And um he is the one that helped me get out of my marriage. And he is the one that had he saved my life. He's given me a voice and he has no idea how much he's given me a voice and he supports me and I thank God for him every day. He saved my life. It was amazing to see Dr. Anoni at work. She has such a calming energy to her. She puts all her patients at ease. She's kind of like a tooth fairy to these people. And through Anony's and her capable team's skillful work and meticulous approach to these surgeries, they've honed in on what needs to be done. The patient comes in for their consult. Myself as a restorative doctor, I take measurements for that patient. And the next day, the patient is able to have their permanent smile delivered. We have a very experienced team that does this day in and day out. After all the patients had a good night's rest, the final trip to the clinic was imminent. The patients all went into the surgery rooms for the last time with no smile. I'm hoping to feel the love that I used to feel for myself. The full like I love myself now, but I'm talking about complete. I'm hoping to feel complete. This is the last thing that I need to fix to move my life forward that I I have confidence that I can do this. And the teeth has been been holding me back. It really has. It is the last remaining huge scar of my life. The surgery would take a couple of hours. So to kill some time, Nick went into the city with his ukulele. [Music] Spending time down in Florida. I don't know what I would do if I didn't have you. Guess you from Nia. Is that cool with your It's cool with me. Oh Johnny, when you wake up, you have a whole different makeup. It used to be you and James will too. Thank you, Taylor and Darling. Dr. BR is almost time for the big reveal where each of the patients get to see their smiles for the first time in a very long time. This is going to be awesome. Just sat down on a seat. See this big moment, the big reveal. It's finally here. Super excited for turtle's about to come out of his shell. Once I turn that mirror up and I look at myself, I won. I won. I won big. It's going to be my first Christmas with pictures of me in it in probably 15 years. It's going to be amazing. So, Joan, the moment we've all been waiting for. We are going to count to three and then have you turn the mirror around and see your new smile. Okay. [Music] One 2 3 [Music] 1 2 3 A [Music] you have no idea how much I've changed my life. A thank you so much. You've been so brave, Johnny. Seriously. Um it's been a very emotional 24 hours and we we have one last surprise for you. [Music] Let me see. That's her. [Music] But that's not all. Before the patients left the next morning, we had one final surprise in store for them.

GiqdbZLq0oM,"for 2 million people in India this is their home this is one of many dump sites throughout the country where people have to scour through literal mountains of trash which often contains sharp objects toxic waste and causes many diseases that are often fatal only to make $3 a day and because it is the country with the highest global population India generates 1.3 billion pounds of trash every year and the increasing wealth disparity between the rich and poor means that millions of people rely on sorting and selling this wayte in order to simply survive forcing them to stay trapped in this cycle this is simply devastating I knew when we picked this project that this was going to be difficult but I had no idea how heartbreaking it was going to be here and witnessing this firsthand this is just unlike anything I've ever seen being a new father and having to see children working in environment like this just absolutely destroys me and I don't really know how to describe it it's not okay as human beings we can do better than to all stuff like this to happen but the dump sites aren't the only problem a large amount of the population live in these Urban [Music] slums the poverty and the living conditions here are extremely harsh people have been forced to build their houses right next to a railway track we just met a woman baharan that lost her legs because she got hit by a train on a misty winter morning if I'm being honest this is one of the most heart-wrenching videos we've ever had to make and although this problem seems almost impossible to overcome there is an organization making a difference meet shka in a country like India the way poor people are treated they face a social taboo because they're dealing with and garbage so people considered them as a dirt and garbage shafkat is the managing director of till Jala shed an organization started 36 years ago by his father Alum gear who worked in these slums as a wasti picker for many years but he was one of the first and very few people who could read and write in the community he became a school teacher and quickly realized how many opportunities opened up for him with literacy and so in 1987 he made it his mission to put every vulnerable child in a classroom any human being they have their birth rights to get right to work right to food right to education poverty has no time they are struggling each and every day because they did not have education young students going to Crime we have to bring those opportunities at the doorstep for these children one of these children is akar a boy born into a society of waste growing up he had no choice but to scavenge trash alongside his family just to earn enough money to live that meant a life with no education no security and most sad of all no prospects for a brighter future 6 months ago roughly his father passed away and that created a lot of pressure on the family now his mother is on her own and it is very very difficult for the entire family now with all those children Akbar didn't choose this life of child labor of poverty of pressure no child should ever have to endure he has seen the schools from outside the gate but never had a opportunity to go inside and sit in the classrooms he was 12 years old but he never went to school he never knew uh anything to write or read properly what do you want to become engineer engineer he says I have I have seen a lot of things on the roads people car breaking down people asking for help nobody comes for help so I want to help these people yet despite his circumstances he never gave up on his dream of getting an education so shafa took Akbar off the streets and enrolled him into school and in only 2 years he's already caught up to the eighth grade exactly where he should be it's my hopes and dreams for him that he can now get an education he can go to university and he can become an engineer like he always dreamed of to make sure that you have every opportunity we're going to give your family some money so that you can buy food and you don't don't have to worry if you promise me that you're going to study hard I'm going to pay for you to go to school and I'm going to pay for you to go and get your engineering degree okay promise deal deal but Akbar is only one of the tens of thousands of children that till Jala shed has taken out of the waist dumps and given an education safe home and financial aid and Darren was about to meet all the kids at the school for the first time I can't wait for you to experience that Joy when the kids come running to that door because I can't put that into [Music] words ched has put 20,000 children on a path to a better life that's one organization making a huge difference and it's not just those 20,000 lives it's the families of all of those 20,000 people who will be born into a society that's more open and gives them much more opportunity when you open a school door you close the jail [Music] door education is the only way ahead is the only way forward which can only transform the society in addition to the education that tala shed is providing they offer multiple extracurricular activities so that the kids can discover their passions they have artistic talent hidden so always we try to explore their Talent we have included Sports we have included tauno classes we have included computer learning guitar classes piano classes and a lot [Music] more thank you the older kids then showed Darren some of their science experiments oh wow look at that it's 3D how did you do that can you tell me how you made this is water dispenser that's I think it's really important to recognize how Innovative and resourceful these kids are they have so little to work with and yet they are putting the materials that are at their disposal over here to build these experiments and educate themselves and learn there is so much potential that is untapped in these kids that don't even get a chance at an education despite the tremendous impact till Jala shed is making in their Community the problem is too large to solve alone there is so much need in the community and so much struggle we need to expand our operations so and there is always very difficulty for organizations like us to mobilize resources and to ensure that we can make a longlasting stamp on this problem in India we have decided to fund the entire program at tiala shed for an entire year to help them expand to more areas in kolata and eventually throughout India because of each and every one of you your viewership has helped get the support for B philanthropy and we as a recipient can tell you we have received the support and the commitment from V fanthropy thanks so much for your blessings but we have one more surprise shafa told us that a lot of the kids were interested in Computer Learning but the local library doesn't have enough computers to facilitate all the children so we decided to help we also wanted to do a little more so we bought you some computers there are hard days there are challenges but this is the job of the social activist to find the strategies to find the ways to overcome them that whatever difficulties and challenges come that will be removed but we're not done just yet earlier at the dump shafa introduced Darren to Moes and adir two brothers who had been working as trash Pickers since they were 13 years old they start very early in the morning so it's like 12 13 hours work and they have very big [Music] families Moes told Daren how he has to sift through garbage for hours every day and he does this with the dream that eventually he will finally have enough to send his children to school $5 $6 is very difficult for a rack picker family to run in on just a small amount moash then invited Darren to his home to meet his family and learn more about the struggles he faces at home it's unbearable hot in here and it's not even the hottest part of the summer it's actually the end of the winter and it's already stifling hot in here the heat makes it extremely challenging for mesh to prevent the food from spoiling sometimes leaving him and AD deer with no other choice but to work without eating making it nearly impossible to keep up with this demanding work you know to see how hard you work so that you can take care of your family we want to help you a little bit we're going to buy you a fridge that works what I want to do as well when your child is a little older we want to put them in a proper school we'll pay for it's okay you're welcome my [Music] brother when Beast philanthropy first started taking donations we had not done a single International project nor had we ever announced that we'd be doing any but in the first week the country that made the most donations to Beast philanthropy was from India this demonstrates the extraordinary kindness and generosity of the Indian people and ever since then it's been a high priority for me to come here with Beast philanthropy and reciprocate the extraordinary generosity that they have shown to us I want to give a massive shout out to the Smith Brother Family Foundation when Darren found out that many of the kids in the program don't eat every day he reached out to some old friends of his and they made a very generous contribution that will help us feed over 80 families for 2 years thank you guys for being awesome [Music]",unknown

TsV0lCqB4zQ,hundreds of millions of children all around the globe have limited access to education because of the extreme poverty in rural areas around the world many children are often not given the same resources and opportunities to start their education Journey meaning that many of them stay trapped in a cycle of poverty but these smart toys can change that over the past 2 years we have witnessed firsthand just how important education is to the long-term development of children so it's part of our mission to give every child every opportunity to prosper we found a company that has revolutionized learning by making toys that make it interactive and fun about a year ago a toy manufacturer reached out to sponsor a video after seeing how amazing their toys were and how they could help educate kids worldwide we decided to partner with them and donate $1 million worth of toys globally meet denesh the founder of play Shifu a smart educational toy brand VI and I started play Shifu in 2016 and learned about the toy ecosystem or the toy industry we realize that there are millions of kids across the world who do not have access to education who do not have access to basic toys that help them build their cognitive development to help solve this problem play Shifu designed an array of educational toys to help spark awareness and ignite curiosity and children around the world their Flagship toy being the or boot smart Globe toys are in a way a small capsule to the world what we want to do is cover all the foundational skills that kids have right from emotional learning to ABC to one 123s to cing to critical thinking when we saw the impact that these toys were having on the educational development of children we knew that every child must have one so along with play Shifu we will be donating $1 million worth of toys to children in need across the globe and we want to make sure that we take this opportunity and we spread joy as well as we give this underserved Community a bigger opportunity to dream big we started this massive worldwide giveaway in the home country of play Shifu in India where we partnered with an organization helping educate children living in the slums you can hear a lot of noise behind me it's all of the kids waiting outside I really can't wait to see their reactions and it's because of the extraordinary generosity of the people at play sheu that we are going to be able to share this with kids around the world hey guys who wants to play with some brand new toys chaos is about to break out [Music] these or book Globes are the first step to helping Peak the children's curiosity about the world beyond their immediate surrounding and if you thought that was special that is just one of many distributions we will be doing in this video so we sent more teams across Asia to three different countries to distribute even even more toys to children in need in Nepal we were met with the warmest welcome and kindest most beautiful gratitude for the play sha food toys [Music] hello House of Hope is helping with children education those who have no parents or children whose parents are disabled these days we live in a digitalized world it's a very helpful for our organization uh in a practical way of learning so they can learn faster I want to extend my gratitude to this philanthropy and play seeu we are excited to have [Applause] this after that heartwarming experience in Nepal the feeling of Joy only grew bigger in Indonesia and the Philippines for these kids in Indonesia this is a new world of opportunity to learn [Music] more thank you thank you placey f thank you be philanthropy the feeling of bringing smiles to these kids' worlds have become addictive and we had the opportunity to head over to to a very special Children's Hospital in the Philippines to drop some more toys off toys are so beneficial here in this hospital because especially when they are waiting for their checkup they really really want to play first before they will go to the to the clinic it benefits more and they will really enjoy playing this kind of G to the Shifu toys providing these for our children thank you thank you so much over to the Beautiful Countryside of Australia where we were invited into this school's peaceful setting to spread more Smiles along our way we run a proud school here the Y Community I am the chair at the Y school um my role here as a cultural teacher I take kids out um on country and teach them about our ways back then in school we didn't have much technology stuff we used to just play out in the in the open in the playground play we didn't have technology now like iPad and stuff there's a two-way science we teach cultural and we teach and mainstream not only just for my kids but for everyone around the community the technology would be a good learning Cur for them the excitement was Unreal and a world of new learnings awakens thanks Mr Beast and play seful for the Technologies really appreciate it with part of the distribution already done we went to four different countries in Africa to do four more giveaways we started at two schools in Ghana and Kenya I'm here with my buddy Abby from play Shifu and we're at the iong school in Masai Mara and I'm so excited by how much the children here and in Ghana are benefiting already from these toys we were so excited to also revisit the Beloved mama Rosy's orphanage in South Africa to share some of these toys with the kids wow it was so special to reconnect with these kids and to bring along some [Music] surprises and even Revisited Dora in Zambia for a lot of the kids they hadn't played with educational toys and from past experience I know these kids are going to have a big reaction [Music] it has been an amazing opportunity for us and we're super grateful and love love love the chys as a geograph teacher this tats the Globs will take us a long way and will help me to deliver my lons even for my students they'll understand more because I'm able to show them I demonstrate I'm even able to SC and to scan all the parts on the Africa map we are so happy thank you we are also giving all parents and teachers in-depth training so that they can get the best results with these play shifa toys once our giveaways in Africa were completed we had three very special places in America that we still needed to visit the first one is a foster home right here in North Carolina where we gave or boot Globes to multiple Foster families any child that comes to our home we definitely want to make sure that their education is a priority so being able to connect and for my child to be able to point to a state or point to a country I think that will allow us to be able to go out and navigate learn it at home use the globe that is provided and be able to learn more we couldn't be more excited for this next one these people are fighting a medical War we all are familiar with we are the good simple living family and this is our fifth annual pediatric cancer toy drive for the Childhood Cancer Coalition Beast philanthropy called and said hey can we donate a few toys this is more than a few toys this is going to go on to bless 190 pediatric cancer Warriors they're also educational and that is so so important for their fight thank you guys so much we then traveled to Connecticut for another project that will be coming out early next year we use this collaboration opportunity to make this the biggest play Shu giveaway event so when the truck arrived the team had a massive job to unpack and unload load a thousand toys onto the stage before the big reveal this event is for people who have difficulties learning and so many of them have been flown in from all over the world just to be here the anticipation started to build with all the guests flooding in I'd like to thank the amazing folks as Beast philanthropy to be here to be with you folks and to witness this magical experience we are going to give you your or boot right now I think the idea is that one company alone can make a small change but if many others join hands with initiatives like this we can make sure that kids around the world have access to education have access to Quality toys have access to building foundational skills that they all deserve none of this would have been possible without the support of play Shifu so I just want to thank them so much for their incredible donation if you an organization or someone you know could benefit from these educationals toys please visit the link in the description below we saw a ton of toys to distribute over the next few months and more countries around the world so make sure to follow our Beast philanthropy Instagram to stay up to date just click

HhBhWdoXSdg,despite its Rich culture and incredible [Music] beauty over 40 million children in India live like this and to make things worse millions of them grew up without having any kind of family every country struggles with poverty but unfortunately India has the highest population of Orphans in the world meaning that many of them face a abuse malnutrition early marriage and unplanned pregnancy and because of all the obstacles that these children face completing their education is unfortunately a lower priority and after receiving multiple comments from you guys asking us to come visit India we decided to and so much more happened than we had expected we collaborated with one of the biggest stars in Bollywood Darren became a fashion designer and we discovered multiple people making a massive difference in their communities so we decided not only to do one project in India but two and when we arrived in New Delhi Darren met with Dr Modi the founder of the first organization when I look back I remember as a child I was all of 8 years old and I was visiting a very crowded place with my parents and suddenly I found myself alone in that crowd and I was yelling out from my parents and I was not able to see them finally the police restored me back to my my parents but that made me realize how children without parental care would feel I started visiting different children's homes in India and that's where one of the children I still remember held on to my clothes and said please take me home this was the start of the udang gar home program where orphaned and abandoned children are assigned lifelong Mentor parents a group of extremely dedicated carers that give younger kids a loving family environment so they can flourish like any other child Society but Udan care didn't stop there in 2002 Dr Modi started the Udan Shalini fellowship program where mentors support girls from underprivileged backgrounds and grow them into empowered Independent Women that will build a more Equitable Society Dr Modi then introduced us to deepok a mentor parent to 40 girls in one of the Udan care homes in 2009 I joined Udan care as a part-time volunteer and then me and my wife we both enrolled with Udan care and started visiting the Children's Home and as I had already decided when I was 36 that at 52 53 I will totally give up the active corporate life and turn my time energy wealth whatever little I have towards giving back to community despite the incredible work that this organization does they still struggle financially deac showed me around the home this morning and I got to see all of the efforts and all of the programs that they are putting into developing the skill sets for for these girls to go out in prospering life one of these girls is Shah I was born in muradabad it's a city in utar Pradesh I came to D when I was 4 years old and I was with my four sisters I'm the youngest if I wasn't part of a dare I would be probably living in poverty uneducated I think I wouldn't have a life I wouldn't have dreams I wouldn't really aspire to you know change the world or create some kind of impact over a period of time shal completed her class 12th and those 3 4 years I used to discuss a lot of things with the girls about their future career how they want to do what they want to do when I was in 12th grade I was really struggling with making the decision what I want to do in the future I'm a very ambitious person and I really want to do something for people because I've got some so much from the society that I live in so raising awareness about things through my art said that she would like to be a fashion designer if you have to be a fashion designer you should go for the best Institute at least in India so after working extremely hard on her studies she tall was able to get into the top fashion School in India the National Institute of fashion technology in Mumbai I went to Mumbai dropped her to the college at that time I kind of felt like this is something different somebody just being so passionate about your dreams like more than I am passionate for my own dreams it was a similar feeling going traveling with her the same way I had gone to drop my son when he did his MBA from one of the institutes in India it is just you know something that you don't expect from someone who is not your parent but they do it regardless so you start feeling a sense of emotional connection to them that is more deeper than just a mental she wrote me a letter saying I respect you a lot I love you a lot I don't call you dad I call you Uncle but the respect I have is more than a dad and when in 202 when she calls up and asks this question so at that time and I did ask him like can I call you papa I couldn't just believe my ears to be honest my heart was filled with joy happiness and something possibly I was contemplating or dreaming it was amazing you can say one of the most I would say happiest moments of my life and in September this year she will be going to the Kingston School of Arts in London to do her Masters in fashion before eventually venturing into her own brand and if I become rich by any chance then of course I will really try to make a difference in kids life like I want to adopt kids myself because I think there's so much you can do for children and for children we were so blown away by the impact that deep poac is having on all these girls that we wanted to do something special for them so Dan reached out to his long-term friend jacn Fernandez who if you didn't know is an iconic Bollywood star with a massive following today I came into Delhi to meet the Delhi NOA Udan CARE program and the girls over there it's just such a lovely lovely organization so lovely to see that they've been able to achieve so much Jacqueline absolutely made these girls day but there was one more person to surprise sheah was sitting in a room far away from the hall waiting to continue her interview and she had no idea that jacine was here so Dan and jacine prepped on how they to surprise her I'm going to run in be behind the camera and sitation then you come in and surprise her we're about to go in to surprise she right now this is such an awesome moment I'm so excited to be part of this have you ever designed a dress for a celebrity before no no no because I just came out of college so not exactly hi hi hello it's a pleasure to meet she hi sheah a girl who defied All Odds to be where she is was going to design a dress for Bollywood star Jacqueline Fernandez on meeting her I was just like taken back by how confident she was as a young lady she's extremely talented I think that Udan care has done such a wonderful job with these girls you know in the way they've raised them the dress would still take 3 months to make so after jacine left left Darren Felt super inspired to do something for Dan ever since I met Darren he's promised to S me a red dress for some reason I like I really don't know why and it's his birthday today so I'm going to make it for his birthday present oh yeah but you have to wear what a make it is that a deal deal okay but first Darren got a sewing class from [Music] chah which I don't think he understood much of Stitch it by hand like this I I knew that I just wanted to make sure that you was testing so as she TS help Darren was feeling questionably confident it's going to be a collector's piece one day this thing's going to be worth dollars I hope he likes it it comes from the heart Danny Boy I hope you enjoy it I think it looks amazing I like it what what do you think about my garment for sey there you go is this my real birthday present for this s me I'm actually quite hurt if I wore that it would look like a maternity dress in addition to sewing classes Uday and Care focuses on equipping thousands of girls with mentoring and personal development that they need in order to excel in life in speaking to Deek I have to say that he is truly one of the most inspirational people I've ever met and I've been so blown away by how profoundly this organization has impacted these young people and given them an opportunity at life that they otherwise would never have had but because of the large number of girls that deepo cares for He constantly struggles to find the financing he needs to support them deac is such a kind and generous human being who is dedicating his life to lifting up and improving the lives of all of the girls that he cares for over here so we wanted to make sure to equip him with the resources he needs to continue supporting hundreds of these girls for years to come we want to help you as much as we possibly can we are going to help you pay for the running of this house for the next year we're also going to pay for 280 chelini scholarships oh my God looks like a dream to me to be honest thank you so much I would like to than you with these scholarships 280 young women will be granted an opportunity to get mentoring education and taught the skills they need to live a much more prosperous life than the life they were born into and beyond that we will get you it equipment as well we've been so inspired not just by this organization but by the people of India that we have already started looking at a long-term involvement over here that's wonderful that's amazing it has so much to do for the community that if we start looking at the picture the right approach has to be what I can do as an individual and if each one of us could think like that I think the world would be a better place to live that's what I feel after 3 months of Designing the dress shetel was finally ready to reveal her work to Jacqueline so together with deepo we flew them out

work so it's more like an armor which can be worn by women and show Power and protection I just can't even begin to describe how proud I am of her she has come so far dearest Papa friend there have

31xHtcMYn9k,several of the people that we have talked to have talked about the fact that they would not go back and undo the injury or the accident that they had when I was 19 years old decided to go on the park run hit one of the big jumps and I couldn't see the landing I landed on my back and and shattered my spine and I was crying and I was in pain from like the nerve pain that I had since my accident I think Rock Bottom was really me really debating whether I wanted to live this life whether this was you know a life worth living if I can go back in time tell my 19-year-old self that I was going to be okay I wouldn't believe it let alone the fact that you know I will be able to fly a plane one day that I will start a company with my best friend and be able to make my parents so proud after going through my injury and being where I am now and having the perspective I have on the world I feel like I'm a stronger person than I ever could have been there's a saying that I love that a character is like steel and has to be forged in fire,unknown
EiUT2gfMPg4,"we found a gym in Texas that trains people in the most unconventional ways visualize the last time you wish you didn't wake up Bo Jones Shelia Stato Brandy Fields neph Mendoza D Chen it was in 2009 when I was 19 years old 4 years ago everything drastically changed I stepped on my IED and lost both my legs I suffered a AAA aortic aneurysm I had had a snowboarding accident and I suffered a T6 spinal cord injury and broke my sternum decided to go onto the park run hit one of the big jumps and I couldn't see the landing I landed on my back and and shattered my spine my stepdad and I got into a verbal argument at a family gathering at my aunt's house it got pretty heated he had left and maybe 2 hours later my mother and I would get home and he'd be waiting for me so as we got to the house my mom entered and he got out of his seat and started coming towards the door and all I heard was like no no no and then I heard a shot go off from my perspective I thought he shot my mom as soon as I opened up the door he shot me three times without hesitation I was instantly paralyzed on impact and I don't remember anything after that I can only imagine the devastating feeling as they realized the significant impact this will have on the rest of their lives with the mindset that I was in it struggles as hard going from like 21y old inshape war fighter to you wake up in a hospital and you can't even feed yourself my mindset was very negative I I hated the way I looked I hated the way I felt and I was crying and I was in pain from like the nerve pain that I had since my accident I think Rock Bottom was really me really debating whether I wanted to live this life whether this was you know a life worth living I've been doing Jiu-Jitsu as an amput I was trying to move forward and it wasn't until I had a really bad training day it was so bad that I got back into the car and I wanted to kill myself after my injury I spent about 10 years still waking up every day like today's going to be the day for myself I remember waking up in the ICU it told me I'm paralyzed from the chest down but then something amazing happened at a point that was undoubtedly one of the lowest of their lives they decided to not give up but to fight even harder and Crush every goal in life despite the change in plans I immediately told him I'm going to walk and uh 6 days later I had started moving my right big toe and I remember my first steps were on uh July 11th and they were assisted steps but they were my first steps if I can go back in time tell my 19-year-old self that I was going to be okay I wouldn't believe it let alone the fact that you know I will be able to fly a plane one day that I will start a company with my best friend and be able to make my parents so proud I started surrounding myself with people that told me what I did didn't some myself I never want to feel that low and that helpless and that weak again I had to stop feeling sorry for myself we talk about things that we can and cannot do I don't believe there's anything that you can't do you just have to find an adaptable way to do it which is the reason for all these athletes change in mindset a gym called ATF 10 years ago ATF was founded by David Vora a former NFL player who had a one chance encounter that changed everything I wish I could tell you that you know this was some formidable business plan but it wasn't when he first started this he had met Travis Mills an amput who got blown up and lost all four limbs I walked directly up to him without hesitation full eye contact and I said how much did you bench with that one arm and he said what did you just say to me he laughed and he said man I I no one's ever really walked up to me and asked me that I started with him and then I had another veteran and then 10 and then 20 and I think that was the Catalyst for me to go we can't stop doing this but how does someone like David quit a promising NFL career to pursue this instead well the answer lies in the past 16 years ago David wboro was drafted into the NFL and from early on he was described as a ruthless Gladiator but what seemed to be the start of illustrious career all came crashing [Music] down after suffering a catastrophic shoulder injury David was admitted to the hospital and got hooked on the painkillers he was given becoming one of the 16 million people affected by the opioid crisis and it was only after going to rehab and getting clean that he finally decided to stop playing pro football I've used quite a various amount of drugs in my life and there's no drug that is like playing in American pro football to make a tackle and the cathedral explodes and it's just there's just nothing like it you just feel like more than a man you feel so Supreme and so powerful that felt really good but it was amnesic it felt like I just have to go back to find my next fish the difference in that and the way that I get to do what I do now is you know when that bell rings and I get to be right there and that person has that moment there's this really cool kind of balance that gives me this like hit of nothing can be more important than exactly where I am right here right now but the difference is is it doesn't wash off I think that's the parallel is we we're not going to make this gym about changing the world for them we wanted to change them for the world suffice to say we were really curious to learn more about Dave and the ATF athletes so I sent Dan and Darren to Texas to see how beastful anthropy could help out ATF is a free gym for people living with physical or traumatic impairments and what's so unique about this place is a system they call Sweat Equity we all sweat together and we all bond together through working out and this is what a workout looks like go let's go push people with shared experience are best equipped to help their peers because they understand the challenges so much better this shared experience and understanding has built an incredible community of athletes that are fully invested in helping every single person achieve their Highest Potential you ring the bell when you hit your personal PR or do something that you didn't think that you were able to do that Bell is our celebratory moment and everybody just stops in the gym and we're all like yeah this is such an important lesson to every one of us our own struggles and achievements may be the Breakthrough that someone else desperately needs sometimes you will even find that helping others is the Breakthrough you need for yourself I was presented with the opportunity to come to the Adaptive training Foundation it was life-changing with the workout almost finished brendy was attempting to set a new personal weightlifting record I was in my head a little bit but I had to dig deep a oh you almost had it so many people around me cheering for me knowing I had that support I was like let me do anything I can to get this weight off the [Music] ground come on come [Applause] on sh each of these people made a decision not to give up not to lose hope but rather to get up and fight as hard as they could to be the best that they could under a new set of [Applause] [Music] [Applause] circumstances I did it and it felt amazing this is some stuff I never thought that I would be able to do so lifting 220 lbs you can't tell me nothing after seeing these incredible athletes at work we decided to surprise Dave and the ATF gym with something special for the surprise Dan and Darren set up a little game here the rules Come here each time time you landed in my hand y I'm going to give you $50,000 $50,000 if you catch it each time you miss you're going to give me $11,000 how far back do I need to go from wherever you want to do it 50 Grand yeah oh 100 Grand sh for the last throw David entrusted Dan to bring in home home but Darren had a Twist if Dan blows it you get nothing can Dan handle the pressure it all comes down to [Music] this but before we see if Dave raises a quarter of a million dollars for ATF I want to give a massive shout out to our partner Stand Together stand together has been supporting this incredible program for a while and when they realized we were working with ATF they also made an incredibly generous donation just like Beast philanthropy Stand Together believes that we have unlimited potential IAL to achieve extraordinary goals when we believe in ourselves and Dave has shown the incredible power you can have over others you love when you show them you believe in them too and now back to the [Music] video that's what you got you serious I'll round it up to you though love you brother um I love oh I love you guys so much there's a saying that I love that the character is like steel and has to be forged in fire the several of the people that we have talked to have talked about the fact that they would not go back and undo the injury or the accident that they had and that is tremendous that is one of the most inspiring things that gave me goosebumps each time I heard it everything in the universe happens for a reason if I had never stepped on that bomb I never would have been able to see one what I was truly made of but also how I could help the world a more positive way after going through my injury and being where I am now and having the perspective I have on the world I feel like I'm a stronger person than I ever could have been it was only through these people's trauma that they discovered their true inner strength to meet life's biggest challenges head on and never ever quit this is a lesson for every one of us with whatever challenges we face that feels so overwhelming to us don't give up and you will surprise yourself with your own Inner Strength Dave wants to build a brand new $20 million Center where he can not only train more athletes and help them be their best but also train more adaptive athlete coaches to take this amazing program back to their communities so please click the Donate button or the link in the description to help make this a reality [Music]",unknown
a6U6AobyWtw,"there are only a handful of places left on Earth where humans and animals live in complete Harmony in the heart of Africa in Kenya lies the Masai [Music] Mara I came here one year ago while Building 100 Wells throughout Africa where I met the Masai tribe an ancient nomadic group that have preserved their culture and way of living for centuries but just like we see an other places across the globe greed and human ignorance pose the biggest threat to the Natural World animals find their habitat threatened by human activities plastic has reached every corner of the globe this threatens everyone 1 million animals around the world are now at risk of [Music] Extinction but there is a glimmer of hope this is the Masai Mara Wildlife conserves association a group of local Masai people that are doing everything they can to preserve what's left through a combination of traditional methods and modern-day techniques like data science and Analysis riding poaching almost entirely and protecting the remaining natural resources but there are now more pressing challenges being faced that nobody is talking about so Dan and Darren went back to the Masai Mara to see how we can further help this community and not far from the campsite Dan and Darren came across something extraordinary [Music] oh my this is Elizabeth one of the endangered white rhinos the Rangers protect what a beautiful animal it's unbelievable like it the power you can like feel it 27 years you've been with these animals yeah so they're like children to you yes these Rangers work day and night to ensure the protection of these endangered animals and because they are all local Messi people they have a deeper understanding of of who they are as Shepherds of the wildlife when we arrived at the campsite we met with Daniel the CEO of the Masai conserves to find out what other challenges they are facing if you look at the last 40 years scientific information shows a decline of wildlife numbers and nearly 40% of the wildlife have been lost and this was as a result of habitat destructions in particular the downfall in the mara all started 60 years ago when the land was divided and given to the Masai people for private ownership this led to investors buying the land for development and exploitation of resources many Masai had no choice but to accept the money abandoning their ancestral heritage and putting the habitat that millions of masi and animals rely on at risk of being destroyed to combat this problem the conservancies came up with a plan to incentivize land owners to lease their land to the Masai Conservancy in return for a monthly payment so that they could preserve their territory and traditions this idea of conserv is just strengthening our relationship with wildli and nature that those people who are considered as custodians of wild animals are now benefiting in the last 18 years more than 24 conservancies have been formed in the Masai Mara allowing for the Masai tribe and Wildlife to flourish together but Tarn the lead project manager for the Conservancy told us that natural disasters and weather events like climate change have proven to be the biggest problem that the m side now faces sadly we've had some really unexpected weather events we've had massive flooding events we've lost property in the form of Tourism camps and more importantly we've lost lives from some of the Rangers who work out here to protect this this valuable ecosystem we've seen quite devastating uh floods they're coming back from their normal patrols they found that water level has risen in the river so they were actually trying to cross the vehicles was toppled over by the uh strong currents of the water and out of the seven Rangers two Rangers lost their lives they lost their lives in the line of duty protecting our precious natural resources we're trying to find a way to support the affected families both Rangers had large families who they provided for on a daily basis and their tragic death has now left the families without a source of income hopefully in the future we can have an alert system to avoid these sorts of tragedies ever happening again one way the conservancies are looking to combat this problem is through the installation of weather stations weather stations are crucial for doing the ecosystem monitoring work and ultimately being able to make informed ecosystem management decisions that go into the conservation effort here another struggle is the complete lack of electricity at the range of Base camps which makes basic tasks like charging a flashlight and powering the current weather stations extremely difficult this all goes in to form the backbone infrastructure that these Rangers need to be able to do effective ecosystem monitoring and ecosystem management work and that's been a big shift in how conservation has worked in this landscape over the past 20 years it feels like we're at an inflection point in time right now and if we don't do something about this it may be lost forever we want to do everything we can to make a long lasting impact on the conservation in the Masai Mara so Darren met up with Michelle the president from our long-term Partners give power they have been working with the conserves in generating clean energy for the Rangers give power will be supplying the whole ranger station with clean energy to give light at night and most importantly power the weather stations and sensors to predict environmental changes and events to protect the Masai people and furthermore expand the protected Masai Mara areas so I got very excited about the opportunity to bring power to some of these ranger stations we also got the opportunity to create a digital connection to be able to transmit important information that they gather in the field to A system that would allow us to start creating carbon credits carbon credits are bought by companies to offset their carbon footprint and allows them to release a certain amount of greenhouse gases if the Conservancy gets additional weather stations they will be able to sell the carbon credits to companies that need it in order to continually expand and protect the Masai Mara in addition to the seven weather stations and solar grids that we installed Darren is just about to surprise Daniel with even more Daniel we we're going to pay for five more weather stations have no words to express gratitude and the mara community on I'm speaking on their behalf thousands and thousands of those landowners who are not here they are going to be very very happy [Music] thanks to all the work that has been done on this project this will make it possible for the Rangers to be well equipped for their fight to protect the wildlife the conservancies will also be able to generate their own income from the carbon projects allowing for enough funds to lease out more lands that will provide larger areas for the Wildlife to thrive as well as offer the messai people the opportunity to live as they have done for centuries we also ensuring that the new generations will have to continue on what we have started because it is also actually changing their livelihoods it is actually providing income to thousands and thousands of households it's a blessing to us even after our donation and Daniel's immense gratitude for this to all become a reality the Masai Mara still needs an additional five weather and power stations which totals to the amount of $100,000 and that is where we need your help so please click the Donate button below every single dollar makes a difference before Dan and Darren left they went to visit the families that lost husbands and fathers in the massive flooding Daniel then explained that Beast philanthropy will be donating enough money to cover their living expenses for an entire year lifting this massive financial burden off their shoulders the Rangers paid the ultimate sacrifice to protect and preserve this land it's extremely important that we all do what we can to support the organizations making a massive change in the mara we have a short opportunity to take action and do something about it before it's too late it's thanks to all of you watching and donating that we can do projects like this with organizations that are protecting our planet and its nature so again please click the donation button so that we can hit our goal of $100,000 to complete this project",unknown
SfB38AuEJg8,while supporting causes around the world we frequently encounter individuals in desperate need of our help like when we visited Dora and her kids in Zambia we met a girl named beauty and due to limited medical resources she had been living with a deteriorating wound on her leg for the past year we told Dora that we would take whatever steps were necessary to save Beauty's leg but if we didn't act immediately there was a good chance that she would lose her life so we sent them to our friends at cure International from the video we did in the Philippines who also operate a hospital in Zambia we stayed at the hospital for 3 months they did three operations on her and they just took her out of that shell of fear and just told her to say hey you'll be okay a few weeks after her final surgery Beauty was able to leave the hospital she just slowly changed into this bubbly fan talkative girl it's been amazing it's been really great,unknown
J028Ay88NM0,in this Village in Zambia a lack of clean drinking water can lead to disease food shortages and countless other challenges this is Dora 5 years ago she decided to dedicate her life to saving children from domestic violence and other threats and taking in as many kids in need as possible and today she cares for over 400 children however with the growing number of kids having enough water for all the children became a massive problem and as part of our mission to help Dora's Village we decided to install a deep well so that the kids can have access to clean drinking water and after the well was completed it was finally time for the kids to celebrate in a way they never thought possible on your ma yes if you want to see how we rebuilt Dora's entire Village watch our latest video here,unknown
ho6Z62S2q9A,a year ago we visited a rural Village in Zambia where there was no electricity limited water high crime rates and countless other issues making life a constant struggle for these kids and staff but despite the seemingly hopeless situation there was someone doing everything she could to help these children meet Dora 5 years ago she moved to mapapa along with four adopted children and started making Tik Tok videos to raise money to build a school and Village for kids in desperate need and very quickly her account grew to over 4 million followers and she now cares for almost 400 children you are amazing thank you and I love you but despite her best efforts the cost of supporting all these kids is an ongoing Challenge and threat to their community so we immediately got to work alongside our partners from give power to build a solar array that would provide the village with much needed electricity and security and for many of the children this was the first time they saw light at night yeah man but when we left the village we realized that there is so much more that needed to be done we were so moved by Dora and the kids that we committed to double our contribution to give Dora the resources she needs to give these kids a loving and safe environment by tripling her solar generation capacity doing a full hydrological study to provide a proper well with plenty of clean Safe Water install a state-of-the-art internet Network and so much more and because of your incredible support we were able to kick off this massive project by constructing a [Music] well and this is just the first of so many things we will be doing in this video for so many of the children this is the first time that they will have fresh drinking water and it now flows in abundance on your max yes it [Music] but sadly there was one child who couldn't join in on the fun because she was still recovering from an injury this is beauty so the last time that D and Duren were here they were made aware about a girl called Beauty she's one of my girls here when she came to us she was a very shy timid girl one of her legs had gangri and was about to be amputated we told Dora that we would take whatever steps were necessary to save Beauty's leg we got the pictures and we got the treatment protocol and we sent them to our friends at cure International from the video we did in the philppines who also operate a hospital in Zambia they told us that it was very likely that beauty was going to lose her leg but if we didn't act immediately there was a good chance that she would lose her life cure agreed to take her case and despite the dismal odds they promised to do everything that they possibly could to save Beauty's leg we stayed at the hospital for 3 months they did three operations on her while Beauty was in the hospital the team back and M Papa made incredible progress with the rest of the construction guys I miss you so much they have such an great environment for kids and they just took her out of that shell of fear and just told her to say hey you'll be okay so who's your favorite teacher very nice it's been an amazing experience to kind of see her transform into what she is now a few weeks after her final surgery Beauty was able to leave the hospital who is discharged you look very you she just slowly changed into this bubbly fun talkative girl than I have enjoying this it's been amazing it's been really great [Music] I'm able to feed all the kids here through my videos on social media but that was a big challenge for me to do because I had to drive about an hour and a half away from where I live almost each day to buy the food that we have since our last visit when we saw how old and unreliable Dora's car was I'd been really concerned that she had break down on the remote roads in Zambia without even having as much as cell phone coverage my worst fears were realized one morning when I was woken up by a message from Dora telling me that she had just been in a wreck and her car was total Darren wasted no time and quickly jumped on a call with her hey Dora Hi how are you doing I'm doing good now I'm doing good I think that this is a sign that we better buy you a new car right now I want you to go look for a car we will pay for it next week okay [Music] um just a I'm sorry it's a bit it's a lot thank you thank you so much with her new car Dora can now travel to get food for the village without any worry of breaking down and being left stranded just a few weeks later the construction was almost complete and Dan and Darren were on their way to mapa to see just how much the has changed since their last visit D and Daren I about to return and I'm super excited to show them all the amazing things that have been happening at the school because of them oh my God reuniting with Dora and the kids after nearly a year was a truly magical experience after receiving a warm welcome by the kids Dora showed Dan and Darren around the well we now have clean drinking water and because of that the kids confidence has reasen we don't have skin infections we don't have diarrhea anymore where they sleep their clothes everything their confidence has just growing up because they're in a clean safe environment with clean water the village is now far more self-sufficient Dora is able to grow vegetables and a garden cultivate a chicken cop and even sustain a fish pond to provide food for the kids and on top of that we also provide a Dora and the kids a commercial gas stove so they no longer have to burn through bags of charcoal for cooking but there was one more thing that was severely impacting Dora's ability to take care of these kids in order to upload a Tik Tok Dora would have to stand for hours holding her pole up to get an internet connection but now with the new solar grid we can put in a brand new starlink Wi-Fi router that has literally been installed today and I am super happy and super excited about that we can connect to eat together for the first time like and we're connected okay let's see how well it works I have a bit idea how about to try making a Tik Tok don't make me dance so we'll be here I will come wave during your turn then wave very nice then we will start rolling like that but you are going out and then he will follow then I will be the last person okay are you guys ready yep all [Music] right very nice wave stay there wave okay come now okay okay okay we almost got it slower very cool very nice wave nice let's [Music] see this one's really nice oh my got it finally it's fire it's dripping okay now let's head over to the house and see if we can upload it come with me the it's done y thanks to this new internet connection the village is much safer because they are not isolated and Dora can also now upload her Tik toks whenever she wants from anywhere in the school meaning that she can generate more money to support the village and on the day Darren and Darren were about to leave Dora told us that she had a surprise for us and before we review what that surprise is I want to tell you about electric ebikes when we told electric ebikes our plan to revisit the village and give Dora everything she needed they as always stepped up to the plate and put down the additional funding required to do so if you don't know who electric ebikes are and what they do they are on a mission to change people's lives by increasing their Mobility while being energy efficient through the creation of really affordable and easy to ous electric bikes whether you need to travel to school

it's a beautiful Loop Darren is yet to see the dormatory that had been completely rebuilt after a storm had ripped through it last year leaving it in ruins it is because of all of you that donated to the fundraiser in the last video that Dora had just enough to rebuild these dorms stronger than before and after months of hard work the Reconstruction of the building was finally complete and Darren got to see it for the first time I'm Blown Away how much Dora takes everything that we give her and multiplies it 100 times over all right let's give them a round of applause so as of today this house will no longer be called the boys house it will be called the be philanthropy house later that night we celebrated with the entire Village having this house dedicated to Beast philanthropy is a massive honor to each and every one of us because Beast philanthropy is all of us you see without your support we wouldn't be able to do projects like this and I want you to know how much we love and appreciate you Dora is such a kind and giving person and she's had such a huge impact in so many people's lives I hope you all find her as inspiring as I do and are motivated to find your own way to

pZ-MpxDZr9I,"this is $11,000 in cash and if you suddenly came across this kind of money no strings detached what would you spend it on they are put on display so that we can choose the clothing we need and want well for hundreds of thousands of people in rural Uganda this money would be used differently most of these people live off of as little as1 or $2 a day meaning getting an education starting a business receiving adequate healthare or even electricity is nearly impossible so I guess the solution is simple right why don't we just give them the money but on second thought giving thousands of dollars to people who have never experienced that kind of money before is extremely irresponsible so when an organization reached out to us to help them do just that we knew we had to fly over and find out more Uganda is a beautiful country and is filled with some incredible people but when I first got approached by give directly about this program my initial reaction was this was a terrible idea I thought that giving an entire Year's worth of income to people that were living in extreme poverty sounded like it was a recipe for disaster gim directly uses a strict selection process to identify Villages most in need and signs up every single family they then provide the recipients with a mobile phone and they create a unique pin number the money is then s to their SIM card so they can transact directly or go to a nearby outlet and use their pen to withdraw cash from a mobile money agent The Limited work opportunities in the community has made it extremely difficult for the villagers to support their families one of these people is Paul I have in a wife two kids this why I'm staying my family is eating a day once that's we eat once S A Time those are the challenge if Paul had more money he would not only invest in starting a business in the area but also ensure that he and his kids can get a proper education my H is to to get that certificate of s for maybe that like my life somehow improving from that part people living in extreme poverty are very limited most of their days taken up by menial tasks and they cannot break themselves out of the cycle of poverty that they stuck into a year ago this was the reality for tion in Loca the kids had dropped out of school and finding work in the area was extremely difficult for them but after receiving a donation from give directly their lives changed [Music] entirely they used the money to buy land in the area and have now started cultivating their own crops they also bought a Grain Mill and are now processing grain for the entire community and earning a small profit they are now using those profits to open up a store in their house and on top of that locer has now started a refueling station in the village this is a great example of what this program does because it fuels an economy that allows them to build businesses but still somewhat skeptical about the idea of Direct Cash we want to better understand the benefits this would have over more traditional forms of assistance so we met with sylvestro a local give directly field officer I'm from this community working in kja I've grown up here and I was born here personally my story when I was growing up I was in school so it happened that when I reached secondary education my parents couldn't get money to pay for me going forward so they had to sell our home for me to go to school and to me that is like selling my dreams was selling my experiences and that poverty is the most difficult poverty the poverty of dreams when I joined give directly I realized that it's really different a lot different from the Charities I have worked with before give directly we give cash when cash goes to your community even business in that Community is boosted this cash enables them to go for their needs to pursue them people are stuck in poverty not because of lack of effort or lack of capability they are stuck in poverty because of lack of opportunity one of these people is Joseph the chief of the village some people are owning the land very far need is also to get some money and go and get a land somewhere you buy then this grass houses the thit also can eat the grass canot last for long and again next year the same thing you destroy then you make him you repair you repair but housing is only one of the many problems the village faces hunger poverty and lack of Education are serious setbacks for the entire community in addition to the burden of leading his village Joseph suffers from serious health complications a few years ago he had a stroke which left him debilitated and because he has no money he's unable to buy the medicine he needs to remain stable they're living is really very hard I don't know whether I can survive I don't know really because now a strugg is a difficulty disease where I don't know everybody here has their own unique needs and what we've realized is that the best way to help these people move towards a better future is by empowering them to make the best decision for themselves and their families so we have decided to commit to helping give directly provide cash grants to 300 families in this Village and surrounding areas that will help them build their future so while the give directly team finalized the recipient distribution process which would take all day Dan and Darren explored some more of the village where they came across two knife sharpeners think do this better goodat yeah boy you got [Music] it now for the ultimate test they bring us a chicken no they won't bring us a chicken we got a crowd gathered behind we're going to see who did a better job sharpening the knife if we roll the footage back you'll clearly see that someone was assisting Darren sharpening his knife well I was doing the hard work this is a professional doing it okay and now it was Dan and Darren's turn hey Champion not wanting to accept defeat Darren wanted to redeem himself throughout Africa it's typical for people to carry their stuff on top of their heads Dan and I are going to try to do this oh my wait no no wait are you got it's your hands off of it yeah how are you doing it okay you ready [Music] [Applause] I won no way okay Darren won that one but he's back how are you doing [Music] that early the next morning it was time for the distribution it's all come down to this moment all of the money is going to be transmitted in about 10 minutes these people are finally being given an opportunity to escape the poverty that they've had to fight their entire lives but out of everyone in the village Joseph was the most anxious he knew just how life-changing this grant would be for him and his family this was the moment they had been waiting for and the entire Community started to get nervous and excited [Music] this really such a transformational moment in so many lives this is opportunity not just for these people but for their children and the generations that follow together with give directly we have been able to change our Liv of thousands of people in this [Music] Village after getting the text message it was time for the recipients to cash out the money for hundreds of years going back these people have not had opportunity but now moving forward they have opportunity a whole chain in history twisted and they can now build a stronger future not just for themselves but for the generations that follow and some of them have already started putting it to good use like Ruth Ruth is a powerful example of what this money is able to manifest before I received this money of give direct I had children of which I was not able to help I could not afford even medication I was just wife so life was hard but despite the odds Ruth was determined to pursue her dreams with the aid from give directly she was given the opportunity to turn those dreams into reality and set herself and her children on the pathway to a brighter future she is now able to use her entrepreneurial spirit and drive to improve herself which will in turn improve her community as well I am able together for my family needs and right now life is just simple it's not like the very way that I live but Ruth isn't the only one who put her money into starting something amazing Muma a woman who has dedicated her life to education after years of grueling work and saving every penny she finally had enough money to buy land and with the help of the payments from give directly she was able to build classrooms toilets and even hire seven teachers and today this school has an attendance of more than 200 children the money was also used in a much needed Pharmacy in the community help pay for school fees and uniforms forms for thousands of children and even build homes for hundreds of families and these are only a very few examples of how this money was spent when these people are given the smallest opportunity they seize it and they jump on it right away knowing that they now have an opportunity that they never had before is probably one of the most inspiring and motivating things that I've ever experienced in my life to round off the trip Darren visited one more school which with give directly contribution was able to go from 650 students to over 980 in one week because their parents could now pay school fees and buy uniforms little children little you can hear the thunder WRA behind me and it actually just started raining but as soon as the children started singing the clouds cleared and it's bright over here that was quite an amazing experience give directly proved our initial skepticism was unfounded and that there are so many new ideas for us to consider for how we can all build a brighter future together but there's plenty more need so we're teaming up with give directly to deliver cash to another Village just a mile away if you want to help click the Donate button or go to give directly. or/ so we can help more

XmtiNajqbnI,"Imagine a utopia
you could attend that could train you to be as successful
as you'd want, and anything
you can dream of. And on top of that,
having the ability to give that gift
to someone else. Well, you don't have to
imagine it. Because we found
a nonprofit school in Atlanta that can make
this dream a reality. The kids sing
and dance in class, are sorted into houses
like in Harry Potter. Achieve some of the best
results in America. 94% of the kids
at the school are on a scholarship. And to top it all off,
there are flying dragons. Dracarys! I couldn't
believe a place like this actually existed,
so I sent Dan and Darren there to experience it
firsthand. When they arrived,
they met with Ron, the founder of this
mystical institution. I'm from the country
in eastern North Carolina. My parents
had never been to college. I was the first one to go, and I was at East
Carolina University and a teacher at a
local school passed away. My mom twisted my arm, and I went in this school
and started teaching, and I didn't really
want to do it. I didn't want to be there, but I just fell in love
with the students and the passion
and the possibilities. And then
after five years, I saw a TV show that showed schools
in Harlem that had violence and
overcrowded classrooms. I had a feeling in
my heart and I was like, I'm going
to teach up in Harlem. And so I
went up there and it was
really challenging. But basically I did
the same things there, that I did
in North Carolina. I built
relationships with students and
their parents. I tried to make it fun, I ate lunch
with the students, and then I made
it really hard because I learned that you can
make it as hard as you want for kids, as long as you
keep them engaged and as long as
they want to be there. And because Ron
believed in himself and taught the kids
to believe in themselves too. In just a few years he was able
to completely transform the lives of the
students at the school. It was because
of this that Ron won the Disney Teacher
of the year award. Ron Clark Which led to a movie
being made about him called
The Ron Clark Story starring Matthew Perry. But Ron had his sights
set on a much bigger goal, which is why
he reached out to Kim. In the year 2000. I was fortunate to meet
Ron Clark. We were both honored as Disney
Teachers of the year, and he said, you
and I should start a school
together one day. Starting a school
took a lot out of me and Kim and our
whole entire team. We couldn’t get anybody
to give donations, they had
to give a little bit here,
a little bit there. And in order to raise
money to fund the school. Ron wrote a book called
The Essential 55 The book became
a huge success and was profiled on
The Oprah Winfrey Show. All the money from
the book went to buy an old factory
in Atlanta, Georgia. Imagine a 100
year old factory that had been
abandoned, and somehow we just both
looked at it and said, this could be
something amazing. So I said,
if this is going to happen it's going to take a lot
of community members to give
what they can give. So with the help of
3000 community members Ron was
able to raise enough money
to start the school. These kids are here
because they're special and these kids
have got dreams, and we're going to help
their dreams come true. And in 17 years, the Ron
Clark Academy has grown from 60 to
over 180 students. Hundreds more have passed
through the school, and 90% are accepted into college
or career training, but 100% discovered
their full potential. Yeah,
the test scores are great, but really, we just want to make great
people who love others and want to use
their talents to make a difference in the lives of the people
that they're around. After meeting with Ron, Dan and Darren
took a tour of the school. The dragon breathes fire. When you shoot
a three pointer, so Darren and I are going to see
who can do it first. But after wasting
an hour trying to make this happen,
they couldn't even get the ball
in the hoop. I'm more of a mathlete
than an athlete. They were
then invited into Ron's fifth grade math class. Pencils down. So, Quiz Test 4, Let's see what we got. Do you know
what's going on? No. The answer to Z is
just going to be: - “Four”
- Two? Four. Someone said two. I'm more of a mathlete
than an athlete. When I first got told about this project, about the school, Darren
kept on pushing on about how much fun
the kids have here. And I thought to myself,
you know, a school that's fun,
that's impossible. I remember school
as just being white walls Friday for me, being
the best day of the week because I could
just leave school. Here, that's inverted. I think that the kid's
most depressing day is Friday,
because they love being
here so much. Most of the kids
that go to this school come from backgrounds
or environments that wouldn't
inspire the best of them, but they come here and they're taught
to believe in themselves. And that is the most
powerful thing that Ron is doing, he’s
teaching these kids to go for their dreams. He's teaching them that they're all capable
if they just try. And I want to tie this
back to Jimmy. When Jimmy got started doing YouTube
for five years, nobody watched anything
that he was doing. But Jimmy never quit. He went on
day by day by day, until he finally
figured it out. And look where he is now. And the only thing
that Jimmy had when he started
was a belief in himself. Just like Zion, who graduated
from RCA in 2015. Before RCA,
I didn't believe in the education system. I was a kid who
was deemed as like, just a product
of where he came from. I grew up in his single
parent background, and so I was limited
in what I could be. So thinking about what
I dreamed of, like I didn't have many dreams. For me, it was just, can
I just do something more? Can I get out
of this community? What does that
even look like? And so I have no idea
what I want it to be, because I didn't
even know what I could be. And so I think
coming to RCA helped me find my passion, helped me find
where I wanted to go. Gave me a voice to use
and taught me how to use it, and also
who to use it for. Since graduating from RCA, Zion has gone
on to study education at Princeton and Harvard and has a dream
of becoming the Secretary of Education
in the United States. But Ron and Kim wanted
to have the same influence for millions of kids
all around the world. So we said,
what if we open our doors, allow teachers
to come in, sit and watch
what we're doing, and take our methods
and ideas back to their schools? We thought that would be
transformative. And this method has proven
to be so successful that we wanted to help
even more teachers. So along with
our partners Stand Together,
VICTRA and Chegg, we paid for 200 teachers
from all around the country
to attend this event. So the
next morning, the hall quickly started to fill up
with all the teachers. After their registration, they were put through
an intense crash course to learn this new way
to bring out the best in their students
and help build confidence. It's been an
amazing experience to see different tools
that I could add to my toolkit as an educator,
to make sure that I'm meeting the
needs of all my students. The students here
have autonomy so they're able to be themselves, and that is something
that I love being able to take back where I put
my students in charge, and I give them
kind of that role to take the autonomy
of their learning. I'm excited to come to
school every single day, because I know there's
going to be something different and something
new in store. Teachers, they're always
supporting you, so you know they're going
to have your back, do whatever, you know
task comes your way. One thing that I love
is the relationship between the teachers
and the parents. The teachers
are very engaged, and they want to make
the parents very aware of what's going on
with every day at school. The kids get up
and they're they're motivated
actually to get to class. And the teachers just find
different ways to teach. And that's the key to it. When you affect
the life of a child, you do not only affect
the life of that child. Indirectly,
your impact will also have an influence upon that child's
future spouse. Everybody
that one day that child's life will have
an impact upon. Every teacher
needs to realize it could be in
the millions of lives that are indirectly
affected by ours. If you believe
in yourself, if you believe in
somebody else that you close, to build
that person up, give them the confidence
that they need to go out there
and chase their dreams and see what they truly
are able to accomplish. Through this
course at the RCA. We have equipped
hundreds of teachers to positively influence thousands of kids
at schools all across the country
for generations to come. There’s so
many inspirational stories that we
found over here, but one of the ones
that has touched me the most is the story
about Ryan Marshall. Ryan Marshall was one
of the most incredible individuals we've
ever had come to RCA. Talented,
creative, a musician. He was brilliant. Unfortunately, when
he was in ninth grade, someone tried to
steal his mother's car and the person pulled
a gun on his mother, and Ryan jumped in front of his mother
to protect her. And he took the bullet
to the heart, and he died
in his mom's arms. We found his journal where he told himself
in his journal, you have the power
to change the world. Use it each
and every day. We put that on the wall to remind us that
we all have the power to make an impact
in the lives of others. If we live our life
in the right way and we seek to uplift
our communities. That's what
Ryan Marshall did. That's the spirit he had, and that's
why we have tried to embody his spirit
here at RCA. I think that you do
embody his spirit in about believing
in yourself and achieving everything
and changing the world. We also want
to memorialize him, VICTRA and
Beast Philanthropy are gonna do a four
year scholarship for a child so that you guys
can name it in his honor. It's really beautiful. Thank you. Before I reveal how ten of you
will get a life changing surprise, I want to tell
you about Chegg. Chegg is a personalized
learning assistant designed

they sponsored this video and helped us fund
what you saw here. So click the link in description
to learn more about Chegg. Their AI tools,
and how they can help you. Thank you for
sponsoring this video. You're an amazing project. Let's get
back to helping people. Ryan Marshall made the
ultimate sacrifice to save his family. And together
with VICTRA we honored his
dedication and courage by funding a
full ride scholarship to the
Ron Clark Academy. And we want to take it one
step further than that, which is why
I have this book. Jim Keyes just released this
book called Education is Freedom, and he has
agreed to give Ten, $10,000
scholarships to ten of you anywhere in the world
that read this book and make a video on
why education is freedom. You can find out
more information and read a free
copy of this book using the link
in the description below. Thank you so much,
Stand Together for bringing all this together
and helping out. Also VICTRA and Chegg. We had so many people help us
with this video, it was awesome. Stand Together
believes exactly the same thing that we do. That when a person believes in themselves, they will
accomplish things that they never dreamed that they would
be able to. And this is a
really important lesson that I want
you guys to take home. The Ron Clark Academy
helps these kids uncover their true talents and their true potential, so that they can
transform their lives and use their
talent and potential to help lift others and help them
achieve their best too. And most importantly, thank you for lending
us your eyeballs so we can make more
ad revenue and fund more projects
like this. Go watch more

3cAfa7vtnHU,"a few months ago at the very top of a 9,000 ft mountain in a remote part of Nepal this Hospital looked like this because of its isolation this community has no electricity meaning that local doctors have no access to proper medical equipment and often had to perform surgeries and complex procedures in the dark using only a flashlight and very basic tools if more complex care was needed it would take hours to walk to a better medical facility these limitations have resulted in many fatalities and miscarriages so our long-term Partners give power who we have worked with in three previous Beast philanthropy videos asked Dan and Darren to join them on a track to the Village of caguan to help them solve this problem where they were given an incredibly warm welcome in undoubtedly one of the most beautiful places on Earth on the first morning Darren met up with a local give power engineer named Sanjay who told him a tragic story about nerra a woman from the village who had previously lost her baby due to the freezing temperatures and lack of appropriate medical facilities and Equipment she had to travel in the Monson roads to the nearest boting Center and then since the birthing center was far away they couldn't reach to the birthing center and had to lose the baby and due to a lack of government funding this Hospital would not get electricity until at least 2030 if the hospital was up and running with the birthing facility the case with her would have been completely different Darren knew we had to act fast to prevent this from happening again so he also met Melissa the founder of the green program who brought a bunch of incredible students and volunteers to help finish this massive project when I was younger I was visiting my family in Malaysia it was the first time I saw the ocean it was the first time I saw the reef and it was really the first time where I realized that if we had the opportunity to show people the beauty of Nature and the world it really unlocks something that makes us want to protect it too so we've essentially taken students from all over the world who care so deeply about making an impact and being able to expose our future generations to different perspectives is a way that we believe can really make the world a better place after meeting Sanjay and Melissa Darren was more inspired than ever before to get to work by installing a solar array in batteries to power the new hospital as well as provide all the equipment to outfit a safe and modern birthing center to serve this vulnerable Community okay we're ready for day one 3 2 1 so the team was beyond excited to get work we're going to dig down let's go by the end of the first day the team managed to finish all the digging and wiring I can't really put my finger on it but there is something about the people in this Village their authenticity their friendliness and their openness has made me feel part of their families in just a few days as we walked up to this house somebody ran inside and he L her find his smoke coming out and we didn't know what was going on but he went to go Brew some tea this is Himalayan black tea with ginger and it is really the best tea I've ever had in my entire life this is the culture over here these people are incredibly kind and welcoming and everywhere you go they want to take care of us they have literally opened up their houses and given us a bedroom in their house so that Dan and I have a comfortable place to stay but not long after the construction began Dan started to feel ill I feel like super sick so I've got to go over to the local Post to get checked out which means he can experience firsthand just how difficult it is to get treated in such a remote location as you can see everything's locked up here and that's the harsh reality is if you severely ill in a village nearby you'd have to make a 7-hour trick to get to the closest big facility that can help fortunately there was a nurse on site that was able to see him this is karuna a nurse in the local town of Kagan she's come to help me but because there is no electricity she can only do a very basic checkup she came to the conclusion that Dan had GTI GTI yeah we've got GTI right it's a rare NE disease actually it's just a minor cold but for a community this size there are often far more serious situations that required an immediate and comprehensive treatment that just are not available with so much writing on this project the team were already feeling the tense pressure so while Dan got some rest they continued with the [Music] [Music] construction now that the supporting structure was built we could begin installing the solar panels because of the team's hard work we were now ahead of schedule so Darren took the time to find out more about San when I was working and repeating the in na Himalayas we find out this village with no elri City at all and then when you get here I saw a baby was there in a wooden box you know and then there was a light bulbs on you know hitting it and suddenly it popped my mind and I think this kind of equipment can be you know built by ourselves and after that I formed a team out here in Nepal and then we were able to make a baby warmer and we call it Nano Nani in Nepali that means a warm child nanani became such a success that it won a People's Choice Award in the USA I think it's a dream come true for me because the vision is like to you know to build this kind of warmer and then to aware the people about the significance in remote settings and the remote Hospital like this in the background realizing the life-saving importance of simple medical equipment Darren decided to surprise Sanjay by buying 10 more baby warmers that he could give to other communities and similar needs sanj um I want to buy another 10 of those baby warmers from you and let you just go give it to whatever hospitals or communities need them thank thank you very much there it means a lot for me and the team it feels [Music] unreal with only one day remaining we were so close to finishing the [Music] construction and the whole team gathered to sign the final solar [Music] [Applause] panel and Darren had the honor of tightening the final B together with we turned a broken building with no electricity into a fully operational hospital that will service over 16,000 people in this community I have so much gratitude for the fact that we are able to come in here and give them a gift that will make a meaningful difference to these people for generations to come it's getting close to Nightfall now and it's nearly time to surprise the community and I can't wait the whole village came to the hospital to witness the lights turn on for the first time are you ready 3 2 1 seeing the lights come on for the first time in a community it never gets old and it's been absolutely incredible sharing it with this community the next morning Sanjay invited nerra back to the hospital so he could show her all of the new equipment including his is baby warmers now she's very much optimistic that no one has to go through what she went through she's very happy and grateful for the birthing facility over here Namaste before the final surprise I want to say a huge thanks to sponsor this video the best food on the planet not febles kellogs for just this time being because they're helping us help people from today until June 31st 2024 Kell is teaming up with Minecraft to give you free exclusive exclusive character creator items like this a camel hat an axel

sorry for cheating on you but I got to do what I got to do to help people thank you Kell for sponsoring this video and let's get back into it when speaking to Sanjay we found out that although he is nepes he has never been to Everest and it has always been a dream of his to see the massive Mountain so on the last morning we decided to surprise him with a once in A- lifetime trip we're so close to Everest that just made sense that we go visit it we took Sanjay to the highest point on Everest that a helicopter can reach the the air was so thin Darren Dan and Sanjay were only allowed to spend 2 minutes up there or they could get hypoxia from lack of oxygen Darren and I are at the highest point we've ever been together I can't believe this happening seeing Everest literally brought Sanjay to his knees with emotion it's so overwhelming it's a dream for me to come here and see the Ever Rest again I just want to thank our partners at give power and the green program for making this project possible obviously a lot goes into making these projects and so if if you want to learn more about it Dan actually made a behind the scenes video that you can click the link in the description to go watch this is what happens behind the scenes on a beast philanthropy shoot enjoy clap your thing we got it I've noticed you guys click off at the end of the video so this time when I talk there'll be

VGvj6bj4Sog,"In just the USA. Over 150 million people
have limited transportation. That's almost
half the population. And in even poorer countries
around the world, lack of transportation
is even higher. A year ago, when we found out
about the shortage of sanitary drinking water in Kenya, we distributed
dozens of Lectric eBikes to water deliverymen who used to push their heavily
loaded bicycles over ten miles around the city
just to make $7 a day. With their new bikes, they are now able to do
a lot more trips per day, which leads to significantly
more income for their families. You have made work easier. And after seeing the profound
impact it had on the community, we went to our partners
at Lectric eBikes to see if they
wanted to help us. Seeing how they sponsored 13 of
our Beast Philanthropy videos. I don't think you'll be shocked
to hear that they donated $600,000
worth of Lectric eBikes We then asked you guys
to nominate a person you knew that was in need of life
changing transportation. And after receiving
thousands of videos of amazing people in need. We were so excited to start
giving them away. This e-bike
would change my life. That will help me and my husband
so much. We're kicking off this massive giveaway
right here in North Carolina where Darren will give away
the first of over 600 bikes. This is Maria, a single mother
of two children who works  for 14 hours a day
washing dishes only to send the little pay
she has back to her children in Guatemala, who she hasn't seen in years. I have been here for a long time. It's been 5 years now. And on top of her
long working hours, she still has to walk
for miles every single day just to get to
and from work. This is the first of
hundreds of bikes that we're going to be
giving away across the country. And because this is
the first one, we're going to surprise Maria
with an extra $5,000 in cash. Okay, Let's go surprise her. We got you a present. Maria told us
she donates whatever she has left to feed poor kids
from her village back home. So on top of the $5,000,
we surprised her with an additional
$7,000 so that she can help her
village in Guatemala. With this new bike,
Maria can easily get to and from work
in only 10 minutes, not being able
to get to work or to get to school or to get to your
medical appointments. It exacerbates the problems
that people face and it keeps them trapped in the circumstances
that they are in. Now, if you
thought that was special. we still have
599 more to go. It’s going to get crazy. No way! Yes, it is here. It looks so good. I went super far. Thank you guys so much. Now, it was time to meet Conrad. Every single day,
he walks a total of 4 hours just to get to work and back. I'm the type of person
that works you know, 80 hours a week,
but with me not having transportation is hard for me
to even get 40 hours a week. I want to own my own business
one day. And with me being able
to have transportation, it would be easier to get to that goal
of owning my own business. Conrad’s Story is just
another example of the dire need for transportation. Oh Wow! This bike
 will now save Conrad 3 hours
every single day. Because now I
won't be standing still. I'll be slowly moving forward
to the next goal in my life. I can't believe I'm
saying this, but we still have 400 more to go. Thanks! Look at this bike. So sick. Thank you, MrBeast Thank you so much. Thank you very much. You have no idea
how much it means to me. It’s so smooth. Thanks! Thank you. Thank you, this means so much to me. We then met
with Amanda and Susan, two incredible women from
the Interfaith Refugee Center who have dedicated
their entire lives to support thousands of refugees
and provide them with the necessities
they need to live a normal life. They've left their culture.
They've left their language. They've left their families. And we see them probably
at one of the lowest points of their lives. And despite their best efforts,
the lack of transportation makes it incredibly difficult
for the refugees to easily integrate into society. They rely on
volunteers or staff to get to the places
they need to go. Reliable transportation
can change the lives of so many of these refugees. So we decided to donate
10 Lectric eBikes to the refugee center. These bikes will enable
the refugees to move around, get to their jobs,
and even help integrating
into the communities. We've made it pretty far, but we still have 200
more bikes to give away, which, mind
you, is worth 200 grand. And I'm not really sure
why they gave us all these bikes for free, shoutout
to Lectric eBikes. Let's keep helping people. Look at the box It’s here. Thanks Beast Philanthropy! Thank you MrBeast. Thank you. I drove it through
like a fort of snow today And it did great! You guys have actually
changed my life. I just want to say thank you. I can go anywhere
I want now. Thank you, MrBeast. Thank you, MrBeast. Thank you, MrBeast. And this will help me a ton. I appreciate it. I want to thank you
all very, very much. And now it was time
for the very last recipient. This is Reginald. He has lived
at this community center for 12 years,
helping those in need. My daughters
and my grandkids are my inspiration. If you keep doing good, good things
are going to come out of it. And although he is making a positive impact
on those around him, he still has

Q49kJeG6nr8,"Every year, over
200,000 children are born without
the ability to smile, and even worse,
breathe properly. 99% of people
are born like this, with a full ability to breathe
through their nasal airway passage. However, the
other 1% look like this, with a cleft lip or palate which makes
life terribly difficult for these children
as they grow up. In poorer areas, there is no
way for many of these people to get healthcare,
meaning thousands of them grow up without ever having the
opportunity to receive surgery, which results in bullying
and social isolation. But, there is
one organization that is making a big difference in
communities all around the world. Meet Kathy. 40 years ago,
my husband and I were asked to
go to the Philippines. We landed in
sites one after the next, and we saw 300 children
with cleft lip and palates. We just didn't
know what to do We said, let's do
what we can, and we
were able to do 40. The rest,
we had to turn away So, we said
to ourselves, okay, well, we
should go back. We should
at least finish. This was the
start of Operation Smile and in
40 years, they've been able to
achieve over 400,000 successful surgeries
for patients in 36 countries all around the world. However, in Mexico,
the number of cleft cases are
quickly increasing and becoming difficult
to maintain alone. They desperately
need our help. So, Darren
and Dan flew to Puebla, Mexico,
a city with rich Latin history and culture. On their arrival, Dan got the rare
opportunity to showcase this incredible city from above
by being invited to ring the cathedral
bell at first light. They were
welcomed by Mauricio. I started with
Operation Smile 11 years ago. One of the reasons why I wanted to
dedicate my life into nonprofits is because in Mexico, there's a huge gap
between people that can actually have
access to any surgery. I met a
young lady, and when she came to one of our
surgical programs, she had a bruised eye. They threw
stones at her because of the way she spoke. It just broke my heart. This is one of
the consequences of a cleft I always say
that behind the patient, there's a story, and behind the story,
you have a human. And I decided
to dedicate my life to the cleft
cause in Mexico We met a young child,
and he is one of the sweetest kids I've ever
met in my entire life But he has a terrible
disfigurement on his face. And this
child is so sweet and so loving, but it breaks my heart knowing
the bullying that he is going to face as
he grows up. One of these
patients is Emmanuel. 17 months ago, he was born
with a bilateral cleft palate. He is the
son of Jerónimo, a single father
who lives in the rural
mountains of Chiapas. The cost
of health care has proven to be
extremely expensive for him, as he barely makes enough
money to support his son. Meaning that his only hope
is to travel by bus for 17 hours to Puebla for the only chance of being
selected for a surgery. And if not selected, it may be
the last chance Jerónimo has to get this
opportunity for his son. If you look out at any one of these programs,
what we see are masses. It's not like
10 children, 2 children. It's masses of
kids and families. We screen
these families. You know,
we look in their face. But if you
look down, you see no
shoes on their feet. They will do
anything for their child. I can only
imagine the pain for a parent
when they have a child that desperately needs a
surgery and they cannot afford to provide it for
them themselves. And when
we saw just how difficult this was for these families, we knew
we had to help. So we decided
to pay for over 100 surgeries. The next day after the screening
process was complete, it was time for the patient selection. Jerónimo was extremely
anxious because he wasn't sure if his
son would be selected Today is a very
emotional day for me. Behind me, we
have the patients and we're going to do
the surgical announcement. They are about just to be told that they're
going to be having a life change forever. 97 patients had
already been selected and Jerónimo
started to lose hope. It was time
for patient number 99. He did it. Just look at
the relief on his face. Seeing the hope in these parents'
faces when they bring these children to this clinic,
knowing that they're finally going
to get the medical care that they need is truly an
experience that moves the heart. Emmanuel's surgery
would take the whole day So while the
doctors operated, Dan and Darren
went to explore the city. We were walking
through the park and we just
found a Mariachi band. And it's always
been a dream of Darren's to join a Mariachi band. So hopefully I can make his
dream come true. Sorry! My friend over there, he wants to join the band. Okay. I got you a hat. I think we have
to shut this down. This is terrible. That was one of the
greatest experiences of my life. That shows you how
boring Darren's life is. Emmanuel's surgery
is now complete. And this
will be the first time Jerónimo will
ever see his son smile. One of my
favorite moments in the surgical
program is when the kid comes out of surgery. Because this
is the first time that the parents are going to
see the kids with the surgery. It's just such
an emotional moment. Because you change the life,
not only of the patient, but the family and the society. Our patients
are going to have the opportunity to
actually have a normal life. A healed cleft
means that all of these children
will grow up not having to worry
about being bullied. And on top
of these extraordinary surgeries Operation Smile also provides
all of their patients with free speech and vocal therapy. Meaning that they will learn
how to speak clearly and fluently. But we had one
more surprise left. Kathy told us about a young nursing
student, Fernanda, who was treated by Operation Smile
17 years ago. I knew I wanted
to study nursing because I wanted
to help kids like me. When you go home You tell your family, that they
don’t have to pay for you anymore. We’re gonna give
you a full scholarship And we’ll pay for you
to finish your nursing school I think you’re going
to be an excellent nurse. - Thank you.
- Thank you vey much. Dan, come over here. Alright, look
at this man. If you don't subscribe, he will literally cry right now. Don't worry, they subscribed,
so you don't have to. Yeah. Just end it like that. And one more thing. Operation Smile
is amazing and they're doing incredible
work all around the world. We want to
help them continue to be able
to provide these surgeries to children
all around the world. In other words, if you don't
donate to Operation Smile, you just hate kids.",unknown

Y45DvFuO7e0,"Just four days ago,
this secluded town in the middle of
nowhere looked like this. And because this
town is located in the middle of the
jungle in Guatemala, an area that experiences
extreme tropical storms in the summer,
many of these small houses
cannot withstand these brutal conditions, forcing the residents to
constantly rebuild their homes in order to
protect their families. However, Guatemala City,
a four-hour car ride away, is in stark contrast
to this with its upmarket infrastructure and
work opportunities, a gap we really want to bridge. Once we found out
about this community in Guatemala,
we contacted TECHO, an organization we worked with two years ago
by rebuilding 10 houses in an impoverished
community in Costa Rica to see how we could
help save this remote town from being destroyed. And one week later,
Darren arrived just outside Guatemala City. And despite its beautiful
landscapes and rich culture, he soon experienced
firsthand just how difficult it was to reach the
small village of Chuisiguán, as he had to
charter a small plane to a nearby town
and then still walk for miles through the
thick jungle terrain, a daily practice for the
locals just to generate minimal income. Upon his arrival, Darren
met with Alberto,  a father of eight children
who provides for them along with his wife,
Maria, by traveling for hours every day
to reach the nearest city to sell fabrics
where he only makes $2 per day, meaning
that each one of his family has to live
on roughly $1 per week On top of this, the
entire family of 10 have to share
a singular bedroom. The existing houses
that these people are living in are very rudimentary. The floors are
made out of dirt. There's no electricity. They have to
build fires inside of the houses to
cook and keep warm. And on top of that,
there's no way for Alberto and the
rest of the community to collect
fresh drinking water. We still have to go and
fetch water from the wells, but it doesn’t
supply enough for the family
 that we have It is absolutely
heartbreaking to witness just how difficult it is
for these people to support their families. We want to come
and help this community. We want to make
a big difference for them. We want to give
them a more comfortable and safe environment
to raise their families. And so we
have got a big plan for all of the
work that we are going to do over
the next few days with our partner, TECHO. So in just
four days, we will be constructing 15 new
homes that will have solar panels to provide
basic electricity, a sanitation system, concrete flooring,
a wood-burning stove, and a rain-harvesting system
with storage and filtration. In TECHO, there are
almost 1.5 million volunteers who have passed
through the organization. These kinds of activities
can change their lives by allowing them to
connect with their traditional roots and support
these small communities. They help by bridging
the gap between those less fortunate than themselves. Early the next
morning, with only four days to pull off the
enormous feat, over 50 volunteers from TECHO
had arrived in the village to start the construction. And with the
lack of roads in this village, Darren and
the volunteers had to carry all of the building
equipment to the top of the hill, where the
new homes are being built So the next
48 hours are going to be extremely tough. With two days down,
they were able to finish the
structures of the houses. However, with only 48 hours
remaining, they still had to install all
of the irrigation pipes and plumbing for
the water collection system. They'll be able
to accumulate a lot of water over here so
that they've got adequate water available
when it doesn't rain. This is a huge
upgrade for them. I've never doubted
Darren's abilities before, but this one
was touch and go. I can't believe it. But they finished
just in time before the sun rose,
to surprise Alberto and all the other families
with their new homes. And the children couldn't
contain their excitement. Let's cut the ribbon. You could immediately see how excited this
community was. The expressions
on their faces, the excitement in their voices, and it
was a beautiful experience. The gratitude that
they were giving us back felt to me like
more than we were giving them. They now will have
more opportunities to make significantly more money,
as they would have to spend less time maintaining
their houses every storm. The new roads
TECHO built will make it easier to travel to and
from neighboring communities. They have electricity,
making it easier for the children to study at night. The new stoves
make it easier to cook healthy food, and
this will allow the community to expand and
one day become a fully functional town with
similar opportunities to those that live
closer to the city. So Alberto and his
family will never have to hike those
treacherous paths again. We are very happy
with everything My wife and my
kids are already happy! I am extremely happy! And beyond this, we
have another big surprise for the community. But before
I show you this, I want to tell you about

PArKPiiYCqA,"If I gave you the choice to either buy
30 Lamborghinis or help save the lives of 10,000 people in one year,
which would you choose? We decided to do this. Cue the epic highlight reel of the year. We started this mission in Khayelitsha,
South Africa, where we found an orphanage
that was in desperate need of our help because it was at risk
of being closed down. I started back then, I saved more than 5330 children. Those children would be dead. But we keep on opening the doors,
knowing that maybe someone will come to our rescue. Like Beast Philanthropy. So we spent the next six months working
tirelessly by rebuilding 12 new homes with an ongoing supply of fresh food,
as well as a brand new playground. While the orphanage was being built, we begin our next project, where we gave away
20,000 pairs of shoes to kids in Africa. Beast Philanthropy,
what you have done here at my school is absolutely amazing. Thank you Mr Beast! Darren then flew to the Hopi Reservation in Arizona,
where he met with Wendy. There are over
10,000 members of the Hopi tribe. These people don't have very much,
but they are some of the most generous people
you'll ever meet. The Hopi tribe is situated hundreds of miles away from the closest
quality clothing and food stores, which is bad because the winters here
get freezing cold and they need all the help they can get
to stay warm and put food on the table. When we realized just how difficult it was
for them to get access to these basic neccessities, we decided to donate over
$2.7 million of clothing. It was amazing. Our kids, our people are just so happy. Thank you, MrBeast. We then found out that there is
an abnormally high number of amputees throughout Cambodia, so we partnered with Exceed Worldwide
to give away 2000 prosthetic limbs. What we've experienced
is that it's so much more than a limb. We're giving back people
their independence. But most important, I realized that we we're giving them back
their dignity and their self-esteem. I’m so excited. and I really thank you! Darren and Dan
then flew to a remote island in Colombia where they capsized a boat
and fell in a river filled with crocodiles! While they were there, they built a solar grid which gave the island electricity
and WiFi for the first time, which will give the kids on the island
the ability to access education online. We also built a bakery to empower
the woman in this community, which from day one was a hit. We then travelled to Kenya, where fresh
drinking water is extremely scarce. I am a father of six children
and I want to be the best father of all. That's why I work so
hard to maintain my bread. My bicycle, it has no gears. One of the pedals is not there, the brakes are not 100% working, Sometimes I think,
if I could take a motorbike engine and put it on my bicycle, my life would be easier. So with the help of Lectric E Bikes,
we were able to provide Mr Barasa and 1000
other people with free electric bicycles. You have made work easier! It’s so easy to ride! Darren and Dan then travelled to the Cure
Children's Hospital in the Philippines, where we were able to provide
160 kids with life changing surgeries. This little girl has just got her cast off
and she's learning to walk for the first time
ever with her straight legs. The magnitude of the surgeries that these kids are getting from Cure
for free, will change their lives. And the fact that Beast Philanthropy can come in here and help Cure
provide care to some of these kids is something that's going to affect me
and stay with me for the rest of my life. The construction of the orphanage
in South Africa was now complete, and it was time to surprise
Mama Rosie and the kids. No! Mama Rosie also told us about a boy
named Yamkela, who left the orphanage 14 years ago with
the dreams of becoming a musician. However, he was struggling to make money
and practice his craft, working full time at the airport. It kills me
knowing that I'm doing something that I'm not into,
and there is something that I want to do that
I really love, but I cannot do it. So we decided to surprise Yamkela
with a brand new top of the range acoustic guitar as well as award him
a full scholarship to the best music school in the country. See you in a year. The team then flew to Thailand, a country with over 2 million
stray and disabled dogs, to meet with Michael and help him rescue
as many dogs as possible. Where we help thousands of dogs run for the very first time, As well as give Michael
a brand new rescue van, state of the art gas machine
and a brand new ambulance. Really happy. Thank you very much. Darren then received this video from a
TikToker named Dora moono. Beast Philanthropy, please please help me save our village, our kids need you. So Darren immediately flew to Dora’s sanctuary in Zambia,
which had absolutely no electricity and is located in a dangerous area
with high rates of domestic violence. It became evident
that the lack of electricity was holding them back
and severely curtailing Dora’s ability to help develop this village
to what its potential could be. Having to wake up thinking,
what will these kids eat? That is still very difficult
to do each and every day. So we came up with a plan
to use the direct sunlight and scorching heat to our advantage
by installing a massive solar grid that will provide electricity
to the entire village. It was then time to turn on the lights
and the kids couldn't contain their excitement. Mateo, turn on the lights! And we have lights! We then found out about a college kid
in Philadelphia that is rescuing thousands of pounds of food every month
because of his school meal swipes. I originally started
just as a student with leftover meal swipes
in my dining account, and I realized as I was getting close
to the end of the term, I have 50 meals left that I know
I'm not going to be able to use, and I just had a pit in my stomach thinking
about all those meals going to waste. So Darren flew there to meet him
and help expand his operation to a national scale. After witnessing everything
that Evan had done to help this community, it didn't take but an hour to know that we had committed
to partnering with Sharing Excess, to help them achieve their goal of feeding
as many people as possible. And with our help, Sharing Excess
were able to open an operation at Hunts Point Produce
Market, the largest produce market in the
world in New York City. And that operation is going to be three times larger
than the one that we have in Philly. Next, Darren and Dan
travelled to the heart of Cameroon, where thousands of children at this school
have to share a single toilet and have lessons in these derelict
and dilapidated classrooms. These conditions had no dignity. These conditions would not make a child
believe that the future is bright. Once we saw this,
we knew we had to do something. So almost immediately
we started drawing up plans to begin construction, and a few months later,
the brand new classrooms were built. Just in time to surprise the kids
before they return from their holidays. Lastly, we flew to Nepal for a secret project
that will be revealed next year. But on that mission, Dan and Darren
went to 21,000 feet high to Mount Everest, to sign out this video where the altitude
made Dan very loopy. Darren and I, are at the highest point
we've ever been together. It's been one hell of a year. You know, we've been working together
just one year and look where we are on top of the world,
literally and figuratively. And I wouldn’t share this experience
with anybody else man. Send this to any billionaires you know,
and tell them to stop buying cars and instead help people. IT'S BEEN SUCH AN
INCREDIBLE YEAR, AND WE'VE HELPED SO MANY
PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD BUT NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE
WITHOUT YOU. YOU ARE THE HEART AND
SOUL OF BEAST PHILANTHROPY AND WE ARE BEYOND GRATEFUL
FOR ALL YOUR SUPPORT. HUGE LOVE, BEAST PHILANTHROPY.",unknown
OCKQBMlXeGc,"This school in Cameroon has extremely dilapidated
and hazardous classrooms. No running
water or electricity and only a single toilet
shared by over 3000 kids and staff daily. And what's even worse
is despite the school's mission
to empower young girls and provide them a safe
haven from domestic abuse and other challenging
conditions, many children cannot enroll because of overcrowding and
deteriorating conditions. So in this video,
we're going to rebuild the school
from this to this, this to this and this to this to give these kids a better
opportunity at life. We started out by sending
Dan and Darren there a few months ago
to see how we could help. Upon their arrival,
they met with Francis, an extraordinary man
who has dedicated his life to combat inequality
and suffering in Cameroon. He is the founder of CDVTA, an organization
that helps build wells facilities and solar power
installations and aids The development of education
throughout Cameroon. When we
first visited the school. What we saw of those
children were actually
on the conditions of lack of sanitation. Some of them were abused. They had no right
to raise their voice. They could not speak
for themselves. These conditions
had no dignity. These conditions would not
make your child believe that the future is bright The kids that are in the school,
are sitting in classrooms that are literally made
out of scrap wood. I've been shooting in one of these classrooms
for 5 minutes and my face is literally
dripping with sweat. I can't imagine what it must be like to sit in here
for an hour long lesson and learn. The environment
is, first of all dirty. That is dust all over. We don't have ceiling boards. The state of these classrooms
is tragic for many reasons, but mainly because this
school is on the border of the English and French
parts of Cameroon, making it a rare junction
point between two populations
in ongoing conflict. This school could help unite
these communities. Many people have moved
from the English part and is settled in this area. This school became a safe
place for them to come and get educated here. But because of the poorly
built infrastructure, rain leaks
through the roof in winter. There is no electricity
and the school was beyond maximum capacity. Once we saw this, we knew
we had to do something. - So almost immediately...
- The team quickly got to work to completely transform the school
and surprise the kids before they got
back from their school break. And before the kids returned
from their holidays, Darren and Dan went to visit
their brand new classrooms. Darren and I looked at the new structures
which have airflow. They have
lights of electricity. Let there be light! I can't wait to see
the look on the kids faces. The teachers faces
when they get to see the new classrooms,
also the new bathrooms. The school is going to transform
thousands and thousands of lives
in the future. The next day,
it was finally time to surprise the kids. There's a whole bunch of
people outside the school. This is really exciting. The school was the busiest
it had ever been, with kids beyond excited
to get a glimpse of the brand new classrooms. I just got out of the car. There's
a whole bunch of people over here to welcome me. This is a little bit crazy. The headmaster, Dillon, turned to the new classrooms where he would
officially cut the ribbon and declare
the new school open. When the environment is
beautiful, academics moves positively
just the happiness, motivates them psychologically
to study and study well When interacting
with these kids over here. I realized that
these are children that have a thirst to learn. And providing them
the opportunity to realize that is
probably the best legacy that we'll leave behind
in this community. I can't imagine the impact
this will have on the lives of children in this school.
Thank you. Thank you. And thank you very much
indeed. Before I show you
an unexpected surprise the community
had for Darren, I want to tell you
about the amazing sponsor of this video, Lectric E-Bikes They're back on board
and supporting our mission with their affordable, eco friendly and fun to ride
bikes. Time and time again, they've
shown their dedication to a global impact
by helping us rebuild an orphanage, donating thousands of shoes to kids in South Africa
and distributing millions of clothes
worldwide. Additionally,
they helped us power an island in Colombia, a children's sanctuary
in Zambia, and give away hundreds of electric bikes
all across the globe. And now, for the eighth time
this year, they stepped up and helped us build
this school in Cameroon. So I just want to
give a heartfelt thank you to Lectric E-Bikes for their continuous
support. Let's get back to the video. Now it is
time for Darren's surprise. So the village leaders
took him to a ceremonial hut and dressed him up
in local attire. He then took part
in a traditional Cameroonian induction
as a village elder. What?! Forefathers. Hold it now. Hold it... 
Yeah! I've just been honored
as a chief in the village. Now that Darren
had finally become a chief, it was time to say goodbye
to Cameroon and these kids. We can't wait
to come back soon to visit. By watching this video,
you helped us generate some ad revenue
so we can continue to do philanthropic projects
all around the world. And you've told the YouTube

everyone else all of this work just goes for nothing I have to start all over again that's where we reached out to Beast philanthropy and we pitched this wild idea hey we want to break the record for the world's large food distribution with Beast philanthropy so I flew Darren to Philadelphia to check out the current state of their operation where he joined Evan for one of their local weekend distributions this is Malcolm X Park we've been Distributing here every Saturday for the last 3 years it's become a regular routine for hundreds of families to come out here and get the groceries that they need every weekend after witnessing everything that Evan had done to help this community it didn't take B an hour to know that we had commit to partnering with sharing excess to help them achieve their goal of feeding as many people as possible together we are going to be able to establish an operation that is going to provide tens of millions of meals to food insecure people around America so Evan gave Darren a tour of their existing warehouse at the largest produce market in the Mid-Atlantic region you have 18 of the largest produce vendors in the 700,000 ft Warehouse we started to grow into a real company and now we have over 30 employees and we're rescuing food in 19 different states all of the food that we receive none of it has to to go to Wast in a landfill and we've created a sorting operation downstairs where we're able to go through each and every one of those boxes pick out the one or two bad tomatoes that we see in a box and get the rest of the great food that's still edible out to communities that same day since starting their operations at this distribution center sharing access have just rescued over 14 million pounds of food at this facility alone and redistributed it to communities in neighboring states however Evan had his sight set on a much bigger goal so we took on our biggest feet yet helping sharing excess acquire Hunts Point produce market the largest produce market in the world in New York City and that operation is going to be three times larger than the one that we have in Philly so Darren and Evan traveled to New York to officially open their distribution at Hunts Point when I first walked through the doors and I saw just the sheer magnitude of this place I literally felt like an ant it's so cool to finally be in a place that has enough food for us to actually make a huge dent in the problem after a year of planning and preparation it was finally time to open the recovery center at Hunts Point all right Darren it's taking us a long time but we're finally here let's do this let's go after cutting the ribbon with eing today I realized just how impactful this program is about to be this is just the very beginning of something exceptional it's taken so much time to get here and to just know that this team put everything together to make it possible and to now see it come true I can't even express the feeling with Hunts Point officially secured it was time for sharing access to do their biggest distribution yet and the first one they had ever done in New York city so while they load up the trucks I want to tell you about the sponsor of this video iata is a mobile app that gives you real cash back on the food that you purchase they are helping provide equable access to food for communities in need and they are taking it one step further they want to give your family a free meal this Thanksgiving too download the ibata app to get 100% cash back on your turkey and all the essential sides for your holiday dinner plus earn cash back everywhere you shop with the iata app website and browser extension the average saver earns up to $120 per year it is because of people like them that we are able to help the organizations like sharing access that change the millions of lives of people all around the world I also want to give a massive shout out to Robin Hood Charities I actually flew to New York and asked them to help us expand sharing access into New York and they really stepped up to the plate so thank you thank you so much ibba and Robin Hood for your support now let's go give away this food this is the an Hutchinson school this is an elementary school in the Bronx and this is our first time ever Distributing in New York City we're so excited to finally be able to feed New Yorkers with the operation that we have that we started at Hunts Point and now we can get that fresh produce out to communities like you see here when we first started Beast philanthropy just 2 and 1/2 years ago our goal was to feed 400,000 meals in the first year and now we'll be doing just over 2 million meals a month and this is just the beginning so many people came out literally hundreds of people from all across the community and that's what we love to see we love to see people coming together over the Share value of food just to see the look on the kids faces when they got those meals man it just it warmed my [Music] heart You Love free food let me hear you say yeah yeah honestly I didn't expect this for my life but it's become my entire life's purpose when I started sharing excess I didn't know what I was doing I just knew that this was something that felt good and it felt good to do something good for other people so far we've rescued over 30 million pounds of food but really our journey has just begun working with organizations like Beast philanthropy we hope to bring this impact to countries all over the world and make Shing excess a common practice for Humanity everywhere if I could start something anyone could start something and the time it has taken you to watch this video 280 lbs of food has already been rescued by Beast philanthropy and sharing excess it is because of that we are able to continue to support organizations like sharing excess that make a difference all around the world and I just want you to know that I'm incredibly grateful for all of you also if you don't subscribe I will blow up your phone so do it right now philanthropy",unknown
1FQvRZg3bcg,imagine living in scorching heat with no access to food water or electricity while constantly fearing for your safety this is a saddening reality for the people that live in this remote Village in Zambia where locals are forced to rely solely on natural resources to survive and due to isolation from any City and no access to light during the nights many children are left to navigate in complete darkness making it extremely dangerous as there is a high crime rate in the area this only became evident to us 6 months ago when a woman named Dora Muno sent us this Tik Tok pleading for our help be philanthropy please please help me save our village our kids need you I immediately sent Darren there to find out what we could do to help Dora and her community upon his arrival Darren received an extremely warm welcome from the children hi Dora how are you I came to my papa village where we are right now in 2019 I started to notice that some of the kids they experien horrible situations just having that constant threat on your life is terrible I felt very cold to come back and do something so within a year Dora packed up her life along with her already adopted four children and moved from luaka to mapapa to start building a village to rescue as many children as possible and the first thing I did was build a mud hut and my kids and I lived in the mud hut the kids would use my house as classroom during the day and then at night we would use it at a house but when the rainy season came it got washed away this forced Dora to turned to Tik Tok for help the very first day I posted I did not get any views at all it took one song and that small video helped me to have my first follower which I moved from one to close to 4.5 million this on its own is an incredible fee especially without any access to electricity or reliable cell reception as you can see there's barely any connectivity out here well there is actually one way every time I have to post out here I have to hold my phone up for close to 30 minutes depends can I try my phone I got to download some cat videos I don't know if it's working just a little bit longer oh can you get a signal hold it don't move it is it working okay good we're done to hold it like that it is she is doing all of this solely to generate income through donations to expand this Village we've rescued 350 kids we provide good education for them we provide meals for them just for them to experience a different lifestyle from what they know but the cost of maintaining this school have become increasingly expensive and impossible to sustain meaning it won't be long until the school will have to close down it became evident that the lack of electricity was holding them back and severely curtailing Dora's ability to help develop this Village to what its potential could be having to wake up and thinking what will these kids eat that is still very difficult to do each and every day so we came up with a plan to use the direct sunlight and scorching heat to our advantage by installing a massive solar grid that will provide electricity to the entire Village while we've worked on even more ways to grow this Village and surprise Dora with the team along with our amazing Partners at give power spent the next few months secretly building this solar plant again I want to emphasize how we would never have been able to pull this off in time without give power after months of planning and a lot of hard work I'm pading the last Bol in the Solar Ray we're finally done as you can see behind me the sun is Now setting and in a little while we're going to be turning on the lights for the very first time and from now on the kids will no longer experience Darkness at [Music] night the moment has finally come we're just about to turn on all the lights Mato the electrician is waiting in the container and I'm going to radio him and give him the go ahead M turn on the nice and we have light yeah to witness these children's reaction to light such a simple necessity was incredibly humble oh it was a joy it was a sight to behold and we're very grateful to be philanthropy for that but we weren't done just yet there's barely any water in the water that they have is not Quality Water this is one thing that electricity just cannot solve and with the extreme heat could be fatal as they only have one tiny pump that lasts for 30 minutes per day and 350 kids and 84 staff have to be taken care of by this little water and that's including the water that they need to be able to cook fresh food so every day I will have to then get into my car which will either start that day or it won't start that day then from there if it does run she'll have to do a 2-hour round trip just to get cold water but Darren is about to surprise door about how this is all going to change after to I've seen everything that you've done here what you're doing with these kids we decided we're also going to do a hydrological study and we're going to give you a proper well a professional deep deep well so that you're never going to have to worry about water again we're going to install an electric water heater in the kitchen a commercial gas stove and we're going to more than triple Your Capacity in solar production okay thank you it's been a dream come true honestly so that is amazing so thank you so much you're teaching all of these kids to be empowered and stand up for themselves and you're going to change society here cuz they're going to grow they're going to raise their families this way they're going to spread the message that you're teaching them you're planting seeds because they love you as much as we do but obviously doing more would incur a much bigger expense so we reached out to our long-term partner and sponsor of this video electric ebik as always we shot him a message saying hey we need help funding this project we think it will help a lot of people and as always they responded no problem and then proceeded to double Their donation for this video because of electric ebikes generosity we will be able to provide so much more for Dora and these children so make sure

XkLV9nPouhc,imagine a dog that can't run and play fetch sad right M Goya she is the sweetest puppy that lives in Thailand she was living as a street dog until one day when she was hit by a car her spine was broken and she lost all her mobility in her back legs deeming it impossible for her to ever walk again when we found out about this we supported Michael and his shelter to provide her with a brand new wheelchair so she could run with her new family look how excited she is she can't stop bouncing up and down off she goes it's your you not going to lie that uh that gave me goosebumps wow,unknown
tzZoph8R3PY,throughout o hey come here come here throughout history dogs have proven their undying instincts to protect us but over time an ever increasing number of them are left neglected starving and are forced to fend for themselves however in tiand there is one man named Michael who is trying his best to make a difference but despite all his efforts he has reached a point where he simply can't afford to rescue more dogs so I sent Darren and Dan to Thailand a country of more than 2 million stray dogs with the plan that will help Michael proceed and sustain saving thousands and thousands of dollars lives from the very first time I saw Michael on the outside he looks like a really tough guy with a lot of tattoos from the moment I saw him interacting with the dogs I knew how kind and gentle and loving he actually is when we have to turn away an animal in need it feels horrible because we don't have enough space we don't have enough manpower so we try our best best with the things we have Michael started this shelter 12 years ago after finding a starving dog behind his restaurant since then he has gone on to save thousands of dogs in Need by providing emergency medical care food shelter and even wheelchairs he is currently doing so with next to no resources his makeshift rescue van keeps breaking down his dog feeding truck is infested with and he doesn't have the necessary medical equipment to save more than one dog at a time which brings us to Goya the last dog that he was able to rescue and house in the shelter so We rescued Goya she was hit by car and broke her spine today we are about to stra her in her own wheelchair and we will see her run for the first time from that moment that gate opens those dogs just go tearing out of there and you can see that they're free and they're happy and they running down the road and they're just being like dogs are meant to [Music] be [Music] dogs are completely dedicated to us but sometimes we fail them and it's people like Michael that step up and do the really really hard work and after witnessing Gua run and the Joy on her face we wanted to find out so much more about what Michael does for the dogs on a daily basis we have the Care Unit where we have about 90 dogs with special needs blind dogs paralyzed older dogs B do physiotherapy B do hydrotherapy three times a week over and above the 750 dogs we have at the shelter we also feed and monitor 400 stray dogs on the street daily so we decideed to follow Michael on his daily feeding trip we're on our way to Buddha eight legs where we feed around 70 of the 400 stray dogs that we feed daily safe to say it was way more challenging than Darren expected I believe that all the dogs are scared of Darren cuz every time he tries to feed a dog they run away not every dog look at that one dogs like [Music] me you go that way I'll go this way let's Corner him that will work we got one we were really touched by the effort and devotion Michael puts into this so we decided to go beyond just giving money to the shelter and doing so much more so Dan snuck off with Chris one of the employees while we revealed the first big surprise to Michael building an entirely new Wing to the shelter which will make it possible for him to open his doors again and house more than 300 new dogs as well as cover the cost of thousands of dogs food for an entire year oh wow wow wow wow that's amazing really happy cop as Michael was taking this all in it gave Dan the time to fetch a brand new state of the anesthetic gash machine which he had in Michael's decrepit ambulance Darren then distracted Michael while Dan and Chris got the final surprise ready Chris and now are on our way to fish the brand new track BR spanking new it was finally time to surprise Michael Darren led him to the yellow ambulance that had the anesthetic machine in it Chris and I are waiting right now for a text message from the team back at the office and they're going to let us know when to drive the car in for the big surprise this is going to be so exciting well the minivan I had already show that [Music] you no come on this is said we just got the text to

wtD6o-5RpWs,there are 153 million orphans globally so we really wanted to try and bring joy to some of these kids and that's why we visited an incredible orphanage in South Africa called The papamolele Children's Home when arriving we noticed that what was supposed to be a playground was just an empty sand pit it makes me cry all the children they have never ever ever played in The Playground so we immediately got to work to create the most colorful playground in Jungle Gym to surprise the kids with now that the playground is built it is time to surprise Mama Rosie and the kids it really warms my heart and we can't wait to come back and visit next year thank you talking foreign,unknown
6x_b11Kyrco,"6 months ago this orphanage in South Africa looked like this and despite having saved more than 5,000 children's lives over time he was about to get shut down when hearing about this we made it our mission to ensure this doesn't happen by rebuilding 12 new homes with an ongoing supply of fresh food as well as a brand new playground this is Mama Rosie who started the Puma lelay orphanage 30 years ago after a baby was abandoned on her doorstep Mama Rosie is a an absolutely incredible person but as hard as she's fought as much as she's given these kids were about to lose the only family the only place they've ever known as home to ensure this does not happen we spent the last 6 months working tirelessly so that these kids have a safe and clean environment to live [Music] in done we also made sure that Mama Rosie had seen none of the renovations before surprising her this is going to be awesome Mama Rosie you promise me you haven't seen anything yet yes I haven't seen anything are you ready ready ready ready let's take this [Music] off [Applause] no [Music] you thank you thank you before surprising the kids that lived in the orphanage with their brand new home we had to find someone that Mama Rosie held very dear to her heart the last time we were here mama Rosie told us about a young boy named yam Kayla who left the orphanage 14 years ago with the dream of becoming a musician so Darren and Dan a filmmaker and musician from Cape Town tracked him down to be a part of the big reveal they didn't took yamk to see his old bedroom that has been completely rebuilt after months and months of grueling labor it was finally time to surprise the kids the kids are all lining up outside right now and we're about to bring them in and show them their brand new homes for the very first time [Music] thank you so much for bringing dignity to this children because it has boosted their self-esteem they live in a better better [Music] place we wanted to find out more about yam KLA in his life outside the orphanage as well as offer him the opportunity of a lifetime to inspire orphans all around the world oh come I want to show you [Music] something I kept this all this years remember the guitar you used to play on under that tree across the [Music] road sometimes I even dream about this place this is where my roots are in order for Yam Kad to make a living he had to become a cleaner at the airport leaving him hardly any time to practice his music and harness his talent it kills me knowing that I'm doing something that I'm not into and there is something that I want to do that I really love but I cannot do it in see this deep need to want to express himself through the art form of Music yet he doesn't really have any tools to be able to do so so we decided to surprise yam K with a topof the range professional acoustic guitar but the best part is we're going to be enrolling yam KLA in one of the best music schools in South Africa and paying all his living expenses for the entire year I don't know what to say thank you thank you so much all the music you've heard so far in this video has been made in collaboration with young KY and while they continue to make music I want to tell you guys about our incredible long-term partner the sponsor of this video elri ebikes this orphanage build ended up costing a lot more than we thought it was going to and electric ebikes stepped up to the plate by providing the additional funding to help us finish it so if you don't know what electric ebikes are and what they do they're on a mission to change people's lives by increasing the mobility while being energy efficient one example of them doing this is our last video where we gave away a thousand ebikes to people around the world including Kenya to help them more efficiently transport water so do me a favor and click the link in the description below and purchase an electric e bike from them because by doing that you'll help them make money so they can continue to support these projects and it's a beautiful cycle I'd love to keep going thank you lri bikes for sponsoring the video let's get back to it and we threw one final celebration for the orphanage by getting yam kala to perform a few of his original [Music] songs [Music] will continue doing what we are doing saving lives thank you so [Music] much it is now time for

XrWhDx9Zblo,every year over 92 million tons of clothing goes to waste 92 million that's equivalent to 500 million dare to close or 70 million school buses in weight or that's 563 football stadiums in size that just gets thrown into landfills drastically damaging the environment so on one side we have so much waste and on the other we have to people globally that just need a simple t-shirt which boils down to many factors and exactly why I put our team and all our resources into getting as many unused and overproduced clothes as possible away from ending up in landfills and rather into the hands of people around the world that need it the most so we reached out to our friends at champion who quickly jumped on board with a massive donation as well as Bridgewater and in total they donated more than 2.7 million dollars worth of clothing we are now headed to the Hopi reservation in northern Arizona that dates all the way back to the 12th century where they have built their traditional Sandstone villages on top of these massive Rocky Cliffs and are in desperate need of our help to stay warm during their cold winter months on arrival Darren met with Wendy who is at the Forefront of enhancing the lives of her fellow tribe members and has been struggling to do so for so many years there are over 10 000 members of the Hopi tribe the term Hopi refers to Peaceful people taught to be caretakers of the land these people don't have very much that they're some of the most generous people you'll ever meet the ability to just have immediate access to things it's not there for us the Hopi tribe is situated hundreds of miles away from the closest Quality clothing and food stores which is bad because the winters here get freezing cold and they need all the help they can get to stay warm and put food on the table people are salvaging what they have as far as heating resources they can't freely burn the wood that they've bought because of the cost of it when we first got here I realized how big the task ahead of us was the quantity of clothing that was being delivered as a cow are we ever going to get through this people had driven from all over the state hours and hours away to come and help us prepare for this distribution I was first at the understanding that we were going to get some clothing we'll get a palette or two and when I was told the amount I was like wow that's going to be huge because they have to travel so far people don't even have cars then I started realizing how much this meant to these people foreign [Music] [Music] just seeing everybody's excitement like wow this is not only new clothes but this is a really really nice clothes it was amazing our kids our people are just so happy it means a lot to us to not only want to give to us but to also want to learn about who we are I'm a big believer of signs my eyes are probably all red rain in the summer snow in the winter is what we want so when we finished you know sharing with peaceful entropy and the snow fell right when it was done I took that as these people were supposed to be here and they're good people I'm always going to be thankful for that thank you Mr bees maybe some of the youth will realize there are people out there who think about them I think a lot of times they feel like they've been forgotten we were so moved by the Hopi people that we wanted to help them even more and when speaking to their Community we found out that they also struggled with food insecurity so we brought in 13 tons of fresh and non-perishable foods which will help reduce their food shortage problem and provide them with 25 000 nutritious meals you can make an ongoing significant impact in the lives of the Hopi people by clicking the Donate button down below and 100 of proceeds from the Donate button will go to the Hopi Relief Fund after visiting Arizona we decided to send the team to Detroit and to India to distribute even more clothing but before we get there I want to thank the sponsor of this video electric e-bikes whose mission is to change people's lives by increasing their Mobility while being energy efficient which is slightly contradictory to this plane but electric e-bikes doesn't yet make planes so for now I'm on one of their e-bikes which is really affordable and easy to use they have really stepped up to the plate this year and helped us do so much good like rebuilding an orphanage giving away 20 000 pairs of shoes and even traveling to three different cities to give clothes out to as many people as possible so click the link in the description below and please purchase one of their e-bikes so they can continue supporting us and helping us do more great projects like this in the future now let's go to India a massive shout out to these

it this far in the video let me know in the comment section below by saying I'm not a bad person I watch this video to help you make more money so you can help more people goodbye [Music],unknown

NHXFQSlXNa4,"- There are 153 million orphans globally and a huge portion of them
don't even have access to electricity, water, or toilets. And as a part of our mission to make
the world a better place, we will be supporting
orphanages all around the world. We're kicking off this mission
in Khayelitsha, South Africa where we found an orphanage
that needs our help immediately or it faces the chance
of getting shut down which we can't let happen because it would severely impact the lives of hundreds of children. But the clock is ticking
and we need to act fast to get these kids the same opportunity and basic necessities that
me and you take for granted and save the place that they call home. - I was originally born in South Africa. This is a beautiful country. The people over here are amazing, but it does definitely have its problems. There's huge wealth disparity and there are areas
that are extremely poor. - In the center of this crime and poverty-stricken township, there's a brave woman named Mama Rosie who's risen above all odds
and developed an orphanage called Baphumelele Children's Home. 30 years ago, an abandoned
baby was left on her doorstep and Mama Rosie took that child in and soon her reputation spread as someone with too much of a heart
to turn any child away. - It started back then. I saved more than 5,330 children. Those children would be dead. - And what's tragic is that after all of Mama Rosie's perseverance, hard work, and daily struggle to get food and water to these kids, the Health and Safety Department has
deemed the orphanage unfit to house these orphans and
threatening to close it down. - Oh, I was heartbroken. Where are these children gonna go to? All the roofing is asbestos. - Asbestos was used to build the roofs of the Baphumelele Orphanage because it's highly fire
resistant and really affordable, but it's been made illegal
as it's highly toxic and exposure to these chemicals just through a simple
breath can cause cancer and many other health problems. - Every day is a struggle. Every day it's a fundraising. We don't have food, we
don't have electricity but we keep on opening the doors knowing that maybe someone who will come to our rescue like Beast Philanthropy. - These kids are absolutely amazing. I want them to have an opportunity to have a future where they're
not gonna be plagued by health problems and
conditions like that. And it breaks my heart knowing
that they are starting out from the time that they are
infants or young children and they're gonna be exposed to all of the problems
that this place has. That was all I needed to know about what was going on here to know that we had to step
in and remediate the problem. - We've made it our priority to ensure that Mama Rosie's legacy stays alive and continues to save thousands of children by rebuilding 12 homes over the next six months
that will have electricity, toilets, and fresh running water. And in addition to this, we'll be subsidizing
all the cost of living, from staff to constant,
healthy foods for every child. - You have helped me so, so much. Thank you! Thank you! You! - The sponsor of this video is a company that reached out to us and said they were super keen to help us in any way they could. Lectric E-Bikes is an awesome company full of incredible people, so much so that when we received the
final cost of this project it was much higher than
we originally discussed. And they said ""No problem,""
and doubled their payment for their sponsorship, which gave Darren and the team enough funds
to rebuild these 12 houses. Lectric E-Bikes are a great way to get around with clean energy. Check out their website and
click a link in the description and buy their E-bikes so we can continue to do awesome projects like this with them. We want to continue to support Mama Rosie and these orphans for many years to come. So please click the donate
button below the video or click the link in the
description to purchase some merch that the kids themselves designed. We're gonna use all of the money to help support Mama Rosie's Orphanage and hope her legacy lives
on for many years to come. Also, massive shout out to Dan mace who recently joined the
Beast Philanthropy team. He's gonna be working on
all our videos this year. He's an amazing YouTuber and you should go subscribe
to him down below. - It's taken us months
to get to this point, but here's to the start
of a healthier future for the thousands of kids that are gonna pass through this orphanage and to the hundreds of thousands of kids that we hope to help around the world over the next few years.",unknown
BNO6DjteidM,on December 10 2021 the biggest tornado in Kentucky history devastated everything in its path for 165 miles that's almost half the length of the entire State the house started rumbling the next thing I know that when this was breaking out you couldn't travel the road railroad cars were blown off the tracks that's the third one I've lived through it by far as a word and to get these people back on their feet I send Darren to one of the towns that was destroyed by the tornado so he could help rebuild their Community because for these people this is home I've lived up here it seemed like forever this is where I grew up after the disaster struck FEMA donated over one million dollars worth of plywood to help us get started and by partnering with organizations from across the country we're ready to start building some houses this is Shane Ruby he's one of the amazing people that is going to be working and rebuilding this this house here is completely gone they've already cleared this site off and we're getting ready to start rebuilding that one back we've got 14 houses that we're building in a Mennonite Church from Kentucky volunteered to build the structures for us with our first structure complete we have just one final touch Wisconsin they've done a really good job over here that's the last now we had to drive to finish this building [Music] just leave it to the professional professionally okay since deer doesn't know how to build a house we'll let the volunteers do the work I can't change the parents you have to just pick your pieces up and put one step in front of the other we have the means of the technology and uh we have the desire to help so that's why we do it but we wanted to make sure that the community was protected in case something like this ever happened again this is the foundation for the safe room a room will be built around the perimeter of this that the family can Retreat to in a tornado situation and they'll be safe they slowly rebuilding but this is going to take years before the state gets back to where it was we're back to Kentucky it's been a few months since we're lost here 10 of the houses are currently under construction it's finally starting to take shape but the progress is really slow that's all we want to do is come home here we are nine months later nobody's here no more no I kind of like hey where are we at construction nearly stopped for the last five months because in-state licensed professionals were overwhelmed by the scale of the disaster relief there weren't enough people to install things like HVAC electrical and plummet and until those things are completed our volunteers couldn't finish building the inside of the house I was bailed our first several years stuff like that takes a long time if you don't have steel labor and in order to get the houses done we partnered with nordvpn to sponsor this video nordvpn is a service that works on all your devices that helps keep your online traffic private and safe it also allows you to access content from all around the world want to watch an anime only available in Japan use nordvpn it's completely risk-free with North's 30-day

let's go back to the video in order to get these people back in their homes we've reached out to the governor of Kentucky to help get out of state workers to come in and speed up the rebuild and Darren had some other ideas to finish building the house the house of rebuilding back here the guy that we're building it for is a plumber he's helping us finish some of the other houses and I'll make sure everything's right I never thought that we would get as much volunteers down here to help us out and the ones that had showed up they showed out [Music] because that's what's supposed to happen supply chain shortages have been making it difficult to get building materials so our friends at Lowe's donated 250 000 for supplies to keep things moving a massive shout out to our friends at Lowe's for providing incredible support so that we can rebuild all of these houses I'm more of a Mac guy but today we're in controlling Windows that's terrible with skilled workers and supplies secured we were finally able to finish some of the houses and start getting people back into their home but we didn't want them moving into empty homes so thanks to our friends at 180 disaster relief we brought in truckloads of furniture to turn each of these houses into homes it's been almost exactly a year and we're about to turn the first house over to the homeowner hey we are excited today Darren has the key all of these people they haven't just given you a house when you step inside you're going to see they've given you a home oh my gosh we made sure to completely furnish the houses we built how beautiful it is once she had a chance to look around her new home we had one last surprise for her the refrigerator is empty but that's uh to make sure that you can fill it up as well so thanks from our friends at Matthew 25. there's a thousand dollars oh my gosh thank you everybody so much I'm just so nervous I don't know what else to say thank you thank you I love you guys so much we had one more house finish which meant we could bring one more person home this is for you okay you're going inside she was literally speechless she had been waiting for this house literally almost a year I lost the words we were finally able to return some of the tornado victims through their homes surrounded by the people who helped them get there I want you to always remember that one of the nails in the garage I put that in there and I put three Nails in the deck so be careful when you step out there okay rebuilding 14 houses is a massive undertaking and I want to give a quick shout out to all

ko26piY7LTo,150 million kids around the world grew up on the streets without an official identity they won't have a chance to get a job a basic education or even just live a normal life but thanks to

as a place that they could come and have a good time and play and be safe but try and give them hope it's actually very dangerous hubby kids we've come across a number of people walking around with machine guns the police don't even come into the areas over here Street child United run soccer programs all over the world to teach kids teamwork help them get identities and develop the skills they need to have a future Beyond these streets Rika grew up as a street child in Brazil she was on their Championship Street child World Cup team back in 2014 and went through their leadership program since then she's been named to BBC's list of the 100 most influential women in the world I started look at me and see that I can do anything I want I can't believe that I'm going to be an example for all the people and after meeting drika we wanted to give these kids the same opportunity she had to succeed so we got them some shoes and plane tickets but more importantly we helped them establish their identities to get the necessary documents for a passport to head to Qatar every four years Street child United brings kids from all over the globe to compete for the title of Champions we speak about birth registration and identity this is the I am somebody World Cup the teams kicked the tournament off with preliminary matches to see who gets the opportunity to face off in the finals first deer competition yesterday the girls did very well they had four games they won everyone outside of the soccer matches they get an opportunity to share their experiences learn about other cultures and make friends with kids just like them Street child United even took it a step further and gave them an opportunity to train one-on-one with the pros my name is Ariana christiani I only came to this specific event because I knew these kids were so excited to be here that it gives me new energy to come and play football games no matter where you are we are the same and we all like to you know play soccer any ideas what's happening tomorrow do you want to tell us come on who's gonna have the finals go to the teams boys and girls [Music] but before we show you who won the championship no surprise

match of the quarterfinals the Brazil boys were eliminated by Pakistan on penalty kicks in the semi-finals you Egypt ended up beating Pakistan taking the championship for the boys the cool part was even though these kids don't speak the same language they still picked each other up and stood United even though the Brazilian boys didn't make it to the finals the girls did as Brazil faced off against Colombia and this is the final match they seem to have met their match but the Colombian girls being much tougher than expected the defense was all the zoo but they took it to the next level but that is absolutely the best fitted skill I've seen all tournament they turned it on and started scoring nonsense as luck would have at the team Darren visited in Brazil won the entire tournament and they leave national heroes to help the kids that didn't have a chance to compete we're paying for 1 000 more kids to get their birth registration documents and passports to help Street child United reach the goal of 1 million kids before the next World Cup in 2026. on top of that we'll be putting two kids from each team through the same leadership program that Draco went through if you

somebody else to give it to is this for real for real I'll take it actually no I'll go down that was the right answer in fact because she chose to pay it forward we're going to double effecting that at all absolutely some of these people are choosing to pay it forward and some of them are choosing to keep it the point is simply to be kind for our next acts of kindness we have 30 volunteers from google.org [Applause] in 30 minutes [Applause] go google.org is setting up to help the 34 million Americans who struggle with food insecurity each family will get enough food to last them for two weeks our current record for most boxes packed is 1 000 boxes in three hours Google packed a thousand boxes in half the time that's enough food for over 6 000 meals google.org has created a resource to help people searching for food support and they're partnering with feeding America to provide 50 million meals across the country as a part of that they donated 250 000 to our local food bank which will help Supply hundreds of thousands of meals so all the food that the Google volunteers packed this morning is not being distributed this is what peace philanthropy was when we started and we'll be

aSQUg-h8G4s,water is the one thing we all need to survive and sadly these two villages in cameroon don't have reliable access to it so we partnered with the charity to dig two wells and i sent darren and the team over to help we are building two separate wells that will each produce 10 000 liters of water per day our first well will go down 180 feet and our second well will go down 270. these depths will give our whales plenty of access to clean drinking water these wells are gonna serve between nine and twelve thousand people which means that each person is going to get at least two liters of clean drinking water a day when we arrived we immediately started working with the team to get the first well built this is the stream that they got to come and get water from every day you can see how polluted it is and it's also filled with a whole load of parasites there are some days that they have so little water to drink that they have to drink this unfiltered river water and oftentimes land up in the hospital there are a lot of problems if you don't have good drinking water at times you have rolling stomach many people in fumble do suffer from typhoid we just spend one year one week without water in the whole town both of these wells will literally save lives but there's so much more to get done while the first one has some challenges the second one is even harder being almost two times as deep to get the same amount of water but we're gonna do whatever it takes to help the people of cameroon without these wells and access to clean water oftentimes these kids have to skip school for students don't attend to classes and some escape from classes because of lack of good drinking water we sometimes we carry water from our houses right at school having our backs making it difficult for us to be in the school campus these kids are amazing they're so happy and playful and excited and it was really something special and it was very heartwarming realizing the impact that we were having over there pause before we can continue the video we have a sponsorship i want to tell you about and the reason we have the sponsor on this video is i want to take the money they give us and build more wells in the same place in the future because i know you think we have unlimited money but we don't actually and this will allow us to help tens of thousands of people and having said that dragon city is a free-to-play mobile game available on ios and android basically you can collect thousands of dragons and build your own empire and this month they're celebrating their 10th anniversary and the coolest part is they're bringing back all four mr beast dragons for it the mr beast dragon the beast gamer dragon the beast mode dragon the super beast dragon they're all coming back why isn't there a darren dragon no one's ever asked for one you can even have your dragons make babies and train them to be stronger it's easy to get hooked on this game and i've already spent hours playing it and if you'd like to support beast philanthropy and help us build more wells in the future click the link in description and download the game you can also download dragon city right now by scanning the qr code in jimmy's face it's actually on your face you don't have putting images on people's faces privileges you'll get in-game rewards like 30 000 gold 10 gems 15 000 food if you download the game in the next seven days you get a free game we get to build more wells it's a win-win click the link down in the description and thank you dragon city for helping us build more wells water isn't just important for survival but it's also necessary to stay clean and healthy during the craving time to hardly wash our hands and ski because we had no good drinking water that is absurd could you imagine not washing your hands during a pandemic because you don't have water well fortunately after all the team's hard work and all the anticipation from the community we finally struck water and the community could not have been more excited [Applause] when we arrived we were greeted with celebrations from the people of cameroon the reception that we got was something that i'd never in my entire life imagine there's hundreds of people around maybe even thousands this was nothing that we had expected they put in plays they danced they gave speeches it was incredible this was such a big deal for the people over there that the president of cameroon sent these pieces of clothing to show his appreciation but for me it just reinforced how serious our job in cameroon is having access to clean drinking water is something that we take for granted we don't even think about it and yet over there it's very common for the people to say water is life water is everything based on the data i've been given these two wells will produce 7.5 million liters of water per a year it almost seems unfathomable this channel isn't just me and darren it's all of us by watching this video you literally helped us pay for more wells in the future we also have two that went well shirts for sale on shopbeastphilanthropy.com all of the revenue we earn from these shirts will help fund more wells in the future based on our math each t-shirt we sell will provide 2 000 clean liters of drinking water per year that is absurd and on top of that you just get this cool looking shirt and if you continue to watch this channel just imagine how many more people we can help in the future,unknown

Chris was not even close so Darren grabbed that chip so that's the lightest hot sauce go ahead and down it he's like whoa this is really light is it hot yeah that's odd well that was only a level one of six and Chris you wanna you wanna start trying a little yeah sorry Darren I definitely won't try to get them wrong the month after that we got our sexy Warehouse we started doing routine distributions a little bit we built a massive fridge and freezer so we could give out frozen meat dairy products and fresh produce in our boxes now we're gonna do the next three months how many meals roughly do you think we gave away 35 135 000 or 95 000. so the last one was 20. so logic says it would only be a little bit more but I'm gonna go with the 90 000 90 000. the answer was 130 if you gave away 135 I didn't think you'd scale that quick you're doing this in purpose I swear I'm not this is level two don't worry this time it's green that means it's safe yeah oh yeah yeah can you opened the bottle over there and I smell it over here and I opened it over here and I smelled it because I opened it let's keep the trend going the three months after that how many meals do you think we gave away 75 000 170 000 or 245 000.

yEBK_Ayeiyc,beast philanthropy is a charity i started with the goal of feeding as many people as possible so i got this warehouse filled it with a ton of food and partnered with darren to feed people in need only problem is all that stuff costs a ton of money to run before i started this beast philanthropy channel i'd put over half a million dollars into this charity and it just wasn't sustainable for me to fund the charity forever which is exactly why we created the beast philanthropy youtube channel and we are taking 100 of the money from this channel and funneling it into the beast philanthropy charity b's philanthropy is literally funded by your eyeballs not even joking and because the beast's philanthropy youtube channel has started doing really well we've been able to expand and routinely feed five different communities every single month we are literally putting over a hundred thousand pounds of food into the hands of the people who need it the most and to show you guys just how big of an impact your eyeballs are making i want to run you guys through everything beast philanthropy accomplished in the month of june because it's pretty insane our first food drive this month was on june 3rd we visit this community twice a month and we pack over 3 500 meals and take it to this local elementary school and the beauty of this food drive is it's super convenient instead of picking your kids up from school and then having to drive 20 minutes to a food drive and drive back we literally just do the food drive at the school darren also has a story about this community so the first time we went to go talk to the teachers at the school we found three kids they were siblings and the three of them had shared one hot dog the day before it was all they got to eat the whole day the second darin found out about that of course we were gonna start helping them and now let's jump over to june 5th to our second community which you might recognize from this video and on this day we packaged over a thousand boxes of food containing around 14 000 meals and also 50 000 cookies because milad came out of nowhere and just gave me the food pantry that had been servicing them for 29 years was going out of business we had to help them the beast philanthropy youtube channel also gained 120 000 subscribers off that video not getting about 120 pounds away let's see if we can get more off this video if you haven't already hit subscribe what do you just hate feeding people now let's jump over to june 9th to our third community which is another food pantry that asked us to help out this food pantry has been feeding a whole bunch of people but they're in a facility that is shutting down they need a little bit of help processing and making the boxes basically we packaged around 5 000 meals and gave it to them to help distribute and the thing that's unique about this community is they serve a lot of senior citizens like darren and on june 12th we visited our fourth community this was actually our first time going there it's a very centrally located community and we think that this one has the potential to become one of our biggest communities basically we packed up around 6 000 meals loaded them up on the trucks and gave them out to anyone who needed some food now i know this video might be getting a little repetitive because we're literally talking about giving away food over and over again i don't know how actually interesting that is so we're going to take an explosion break and then on june 22nd we visited our fifth community at the boys and girls club which is basically an after-school enrichment program in underserved communities we brought this community a thousand meals in this day and you might also remember that this is one of the centers that we gave a whole bunch of laptops to a couple of videos ago on top of that one of the cool things about this food drive is i can just walk around and say hi to all the kids and they just freak out if you thought packaging those thousands of boxes of food and serving all five of those communities in a single month was crazy we actually serve each of those communities twice a month and we give them enough food to last them two weeks so even though we support five communities we're actually doing 10 food drives every single month darren break down how it works break it down when jimmy asked me to open up a food pantry i took a look at it and i realized that the food pantries only service one community and that's just not big enough for mr beast we decided that we were going to set up a central location where we had packed the boxes we'd load them on trucks and we're going to send the trucks out every day and following this model we should be able to service 20 to 40 communities out of this warehouse alone june was out of this world for our charity you know what else is out of this world why space come on in chris hey i'm an astronaut i'm gonna cut to the chase this video is sponsored by space no uh omaze was running a sweepstakes that can literally take you to space i can go to space that's right if you head over to omaze.com mr beast and donate ten dollars you'll be entered for a chance to win two seats on a virgin galactic flight to space that sounds amazing amazing you and literally anyone you want can go float in space look at him go also get a private tour spaceport america from richard branson himself conveniently i have richard branson right here tell us what you think richard i'm richard branson the best part is every donation supports space for humanity which is a non-profit that wants to take humanity into space the deadline to enter is august 31st at midnight so head over to omaze.com mr beast if you haven't already and all the money i just made off this omaze brand deal you just heard is going straight into our food pantry and getting the food directly in the hands of people that need it so thank you mates for sponsoring this video and giving us money to run our food pantry since we started the beef philanthropy charity we've given away over 500 000 pounds of food and i hope in a few years that number's over a billion because why not oh my god and that's why i need you guys to watch these videos because without the views this is impossible and finally it's june 29th and this is our last delivery of the entire month it's been a wild month what did you think of it it's been a good month we've got a lot of people fed this month and we're gonna get even more fed next month thank you so much for watching this channel

f-empfLWbIk,what is up Gamers I just opened my very own charity and I just wanted to tell you guys about it we adopted every dog at a dog shelter bought everything in five stores and then gave it away donated a million dollars worth of food to people in need gave a homeless person a house raised 20 million dollars playing 20 million trees in general I enjoy doing good things which is why I started my very own charity and 100 of the revenue from this channel will go towards funding it let me show you around this is my food pantry we have over 50 000 pounds of food here in this warehouse and we're doing weekly deliveries to communities in need Chris those are for people in need well not this one this one's for me and you're probably wondering how does this work you guys remember Darren from this video and this video we've set this up to be able to feed millions of people a year this food pantry is at least 10 times bigger than any other food pantry I've ever seen I love it and all of it wouldn't be possible without him he's the one running the day-to-day operations I love how he didn't look happy at all he needs of all the AG Revenue and Deals and merge sales from this channel Beast philanthropy will go into this food pantry every view on this channel is literally putting food in people's mouths like this helping people's fun the first major event beastful entropy did was back during last Thanksgiving we caught wind that a local community had some people that were in need and basically not everyone in their Community would be able to have a Thanksgiving meal and obviously that kind of sucks so we packed over 1 000 boxes with 30 meals each and went to that community and made sure everyone in need had a Thanksgiving dinner which I think deserves a fist pump a month later on Christmas we decided to do it again and we packed over 23 000 meals and made sure everyone in need had plenty of food to eat after that there was a local disaster we packed up thousands of pounds of food and water and just you know gave it to people in need I just want you to know that this is the type of stuff that the money generated from this channel will go towards doing by the time you see this video Beast philanthropy will be doing four food drives a week this warehouse and everything you see here will literally be supporting thousands of families here at Beast philanthropy we take healthy people very seriously who gave him that if you guys have been following me on Twitter you'll know that this has been a long time dream of mine and we're starting in North Carolina because that's where I'm from but also because North Carolina has a massive food and security problem back in 2019 1.4 million North Carolinians lived in poverty that's literally one in seven people and that was before the pandemic which obviously made things worse I'll be honest running a charity costs a lot of money how much would you say we've spent so far spend about a half a million dollars in food and Equipment exactly and we're only a fraction of the size I want to be this charity is going to cost tens of millions of dollars a year to run and I just can't do that on my own imagine if we can grow this channel as big as my main channel the amount of people we could help would be insane so if you haven't already hit that subscribe button and let's change the world foreign [Music],unknown
