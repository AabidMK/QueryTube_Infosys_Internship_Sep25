OQUV6kEKwlk,"[Music] We're going to Aona. Escape the summer heat. It's September. Still 37Â° now. It's already colder. So, we're getting a break in the mountains. It's a great day trip. There's a junkyard. Mount Fuji. [Music] Welcome to Hakon. >> Oh, >> it's so much colder here. What a difference. This is nice. Oh, >> really? What do you see? [Music] [Music] [Laughter] Wow, what a bird. [Music] [Music] Thank you. [Music] How did we get the cutest boy in the world? Huh? Let's do that. >> Oh, just he needs a samurai sword. [Music] [Music] Oh. Oh. Renaissance. That's it. That has to be it. He's alive. Yes. We are at Unisan. It's this really nice bathing place in Hakon. Oh, and they have the best logos ever. You want to go be [Music] I remember we went here a couple year or like a year ago and I was like, ""Ah, Bjon is too small for this area."" But now he can enjoy it. It's so nice. [Music] [Music] We got the mountain in the back. Big [Music] >> hi Jojo. [Music] Okay. Okay. >> You want airplane? >> Okay. >> Okay. So, my laptop, my Steam Deck, my phone, my desktop. What do they all have in common? NordVPN. As someone who desperately tries to not have subscription services, I still 100% stand by NordVPN being an amazing product. And here's why. Listen up, buddy. You need to use a VPN if you're connecting to the internet. Otherwise, everyone can see what you're doing. Now, I'm not saying I'm going to download illegal Minecraft mods, but if I do, that's my goddamn business. You hear me? Actually, a friend of mine in Japan was visited by the police because they saw that he was torrenting, which is insane. Internet service providers know everything you're doing unless you use a VPN. So, please do yourself a favor and get one. And if you don't care about privacy, it also keeps you safe online, protecting you from all these different attacks. Another example, friend of mine got hacked because of a man-in-the-middle attack. If he had used NordVPN, this would not have happened. These things happen and they're extremely stressful and frustrating and they shouldn't happen. So just do like me. Always connect to a VPN. I made it here in my way bar and that way you know you're safe. The third reason of course is that it opens up the entirety of the internet as it should be. I recently did a sort of an audit of the sponsorships I've been doing. And even though I keep meaning on subscription services, I don't know how else it would possibly provide a service like this. So I fully stand behind this product. I've been using it myself for years and paying it myself for years and I think it's an important product for the integrity of the internet. So, thank you NordVPN for being an amazing product and an amazing sponsor. If you haven't already, check out the link in the description. If you use the link nordvpn.com/piepie, you get a huge bonus, an additional 4 month for free. >> Check it out. A 30-day money back guarantee. And they also have a collab with Marvel.

These videos wouldn't be nothing without Maria editing them. She brings the whole vibe to another level. It's that's just the truth. She does an amazing job. It's a timeconsuming and a heavy job and I uh I really really appreciate everything she's done for the vlogs. Like it's amazing. for over 8 years. My editor used to be Cy and he has released a course where you can learn to edit like him. So, if you like my style of editing, check it out. It's great for beginners. The first tutorial is up on Cy's channel. So, check it out at the editingclub.com. I'm going to drop the link in the description if you guys want to check it out. Thank you. This feels so nice. Summer is over officially. I feel nice air that doesn't make me want to die. The train fascinations have truly begun. What is that, Brennan? Bian was insisting he goes alone. I'm like, no, even for me. Let's go together. I'm scared. This is crazy. Okay, it's not too bad. Was that fun? >> Going to go buy mama some flowers. Good job, Y. Wow. >> Can you blow me? >> Okay. All right. >> You like those? [Music] Always a good thing when you see Fuji sama >> really. [Music] We got a glimpse of Mount Fuji. We can't see it anymore. If you visit Japan, you have to check out Caesaria. It's like really ridiculously cheap Italian food. But it's approved by Martia. >> Oh, yeah. It's delicious. >> And I'll show you what the best part of coming here is. The Dora. You got to get the Dora and the pizza. The mini pizza. It's like a quarter of a pizza. Ah, 10 differences. It's so difficult. Pause the screen if you want to do it. >> We've gotten to nine a couple times, but finding all 10 is like rare before the food comes, I guess. [Music] >> Oh my god, that looks hilarious. Get him. [Music] We've been coming to Denny's every week now. We're addicted to Denny's in Japan. Check it out.

He keeps grabbing them and giving them to everyone. It's It's very cute. And if Bern ever gives you one, you have to take it. [Music] Check this out. Can you see it? >> I hit 15 years on YouTube and I didn't even realize. >> I saw it and I was like, ""Whoa, that's crazy."" I would never have expected to keep making videos after 15 years. Same with the vlogs. Like, everyone enjoyed it so much. We did not expect it to keep going at this point. Obviously, the vlogs is not gonna go on forever because Bern is getting older and we don't want to always film him, but we really really appreciate all the love on the vlogs. Uh that you've probably seen a ton of Japanese comments uh which are always so sweet and always so nice. So, thank you. It makes us feel really welcomed and it really means a lot to us. So, thank you. It's fun to sort of share um Japan with a different set of eyes for a lot of people. So, that's very cool. With my general videos, I still love uploading. I can't believe I'm saying that unironically because there's been times where I've not been wanting to, but that's because of external factors or if I'm pushing myself too hard, but I feel like I finally found a a good u good pace with myself and where I am. And uh it really means and changes a lot. So, thank you guys everyone from the bottom of my heart for 15 years. That's seriously um Yeah. Thank you. Can you do this pin? [Music] >> Can you do that? >> That's good. Let me close these like this. >> Yes, you did it. [Music] Yes. Sorry to interrupt the video.

n_Lv_mw6m6c,"Something has changed. What is it? Ding ding ding ding. Camera quality. What happened, Felix? Not again. Let me explain. You ever go to one of these self-improvement journeys? Except it's not self-improvement. It's the complete opposite. It's evolving just backwards. So basically what happened was it all started with Dioynes. If you remember, greatest philosopher of all time. He told Alexander the Great to move out of his sunlight. He showed Plato a featherless bipod. He was kidnapped by pirates, but instead of becoming their slave, he became their teacher. He peed on bystanders and lived in a barrel. What else is there to know? And I know what you're thinking. What does this have to do with the camera feelings? I will get to that point because there's so many stories with Dioynes, but one that really stuck out with me. Camera's also kind of low. I have to I have to stand like this to talk to you guys. I'm just really tall. Don't Google my height. A story of Dioenese that sticks out to me is the one about his wooden bowl. He famously had only one possession which was a wooden ball until he saw a child use his hands instead of a bowl and he realized what an idiot he was. Throw it away. Beaten by a child. I think about this all the time. An unhealthy amount. There's balls. There is balls everywhere. I can't be the only one. If you remember a while ago, one of my most viewed videos, that's right, my most viewed short is me talking about my shoes, which is where I apply this principle of trying to minimize owning one thing. Show it. I am a one pair of shoe only kind of guy. Before I used to enjoy saving up to things and then feeling excited when I could finally buy it. It was It was fun. It was cool. I was hyped. I don't really get that anymore. I know. Boohoo. So, the way I do it is I have one pair of shoes. I wear them till they're completely  Then when it's time to buy new shoes, it's like exciting. I look forward to it. That's why one pair of shoes supreme. So, I've been doing this for a while now where I've been trying to apply this theory of owning one thing or better yet, nothing. And I want to share you with you just how mentally deranged I truly am. This wasn't even supposed to be a video. I just am. First of all, headphones. I used to own guess how many headphones. Who cares? Four headphones. These one. These one. These one. These ones. They all had different purposes. It all made sense to me until I realized I cannot have four headphones. What kind of epic minimalist am I? I'm a fraud. God damn it. So, I decided and I had Oh my god. I I don't miss them. I don't miss them. But I had these beautiful autofile headphones. The sound quality was incredible. You don't understand. Once you hear music at a certain level, you can't go back. Except I did. So, I stuck with one pair. Was it a good idea? No. I have a meeting and I'm like, ""Sorry, I can't find my headphones. I don't know what to do. I guess I'll have to cancel."" Oh, wait, never mind. I can just put you on a speaker. What I realized is a lot of times you think you need something, but you don't. The headphones was a bowl. It may not seem like it, but they were a bold and I had they had to go. And I don't regret it. I don't. And I'll explain why because I leveled up on the next one. And you're going to want to sit down and listen. My videos is just talking down to you these days. Okay. My workout equipment. Moving to Japan took forever because of coven. So, we stayed in a tiny flat while we were waiting to move here for 2 years. And then we finally moved and I'm like, I'm gonna get a gym. I've always wanted to have a gym in my office. So, I got a half rack. I could start doing benches. Bench 100 kilo, whatever. No big deal. It It was all amazing. I loved it. The freedom to work out in your office fits me perfectly. But then my son was born and we needed more space. So, yet again, I had to minimize. So, I kept what I used to keep, which was my interchangeable dumbbells. Even Plato himself had interchangeable dumbbells. It's the most minimal workout you could do and you can get an amazing workout with just interchangeable dumbbells. Except I realized they were a ball. So I kept only super minimal just these wooden things. I don't know what they're called. So I can do lsit and I can do push-ups. And to have that free except that was a bowl as well. You're looking at my workout equipment. This is it. I am my workout equipment. Interchangeable dumbbells was a bowl. No more. Oh, I can't I can't go to that hotel because they don't have a gym at the hotel. So, I don't What am I going to do? No more. I'm literally working out right now. Jesus speak. What are you going to do? You can't stop me. Oh, I don't I don't have time to work out and money for the thing. I'll push it right now. Uh, it's actually been quite a while since I done this. I can't speak for my gains. Maybe they've gone out the window. I haven't really like benchmarked or anything. But what I did gain is maximum freedom, and that's all that matters. You are a slave to the subscription fee of gyms. You are a slave. Sorry, I did keep my pull-up bar because I like doing pull-ups. I could just go to Don't do Do not call it a ball. Don't take it away from me, please. I know I can just go to the park, but it would be more effort to take it down at this point. Come on. Why am I Why am I trying to reason with you? Become a complete skitsoid. Moving on to the bread and butter. My setup. My YouTube setup. My job. I should take it seriously. And I do. Since I had this principle of either not owning anything if I can or owning one thing if I have to. I wanted that one thing to be really nice, right? Cuz then you really appreciate it. That's kind of the whole point to not take things for granted actually trying to figure out how a way to repair it instead of just buying cheap new ones all over. Better for an environment. Anyway, if I told you how much time I spent trying to find one watch, you would think I'm insane. But I think I've already proved that point this. I needed 20 bars for surfing and I needed to be strong for climbing and I needed to be in formal settings and informal settings because I can't have two watches anyway. It doesn't matter. Since I had this principle, I've been really enjoying that process. You see, I don't have enough problems in my life, so I have to make them. You don't understand what it's like to be me. It's difficult. I make my own issues. I built my own keyboard so I can make it perfect just the way I like it. And I actually really enjoy this process. And I kept fine-tuning it. And I was like, ""Oh, I kind of want it to be like this."" And I built it four times. I built four keyboards. But then I looked and I realized my laptop has a keyboard. That means I have two keyboard. I cannot have two keyboards. Gone. Bull. I decided to keep a mouse at least because that way I can uh be more productive when I'm working or editing thumbnails and all that. It's just a way for me to get my job done quicker. Except I didn't. Whoa. My laptop has a mouse mouse pad. You should see me in first person shooters. I just look Yeah, I used to be kind of good at FPS, but balls. It doesn't matter. It doesn't m It doesn't matter. My display was a way for me to lock in and really focus. I had two displays and then I realized that's stupid. I need just one display and then I realized my laptop has a display. I don't need balls everywhere. Gone. My studio lights the sun. Hello. Is no one talking about this? Free light. What the What is that doing there? You are balls. All balls. And before we go any further, let me just say this in a delicate matter as possible. Thank you so much for gaslighting me into checking if I have autism. Cuz I know that's what you're thinking cuz that's what all the comments are lately. I'm the same because I have ADHD and autism. You made my mom fill out a bunch of forms for me and Marsia. Thank you very much. And now I don't have autism. And that would have made it a lot easier cuz then at least I'd be like, ""Okay, well, what is it then? I just am like this camera. For those of you who don't know, camera quality has been a meme on my channel for a very long time. I finally figured it out because I had a Sony A7 punched in with a bunch of stuff. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. Bowl, it's gone. I asked Marcia before. I was like, should I get rid of this one? I think I might be pushing it a little far. And she went, ""No, absolutely not."" And she went, ""No, absolutely not."" And I listen to Marcia 99% of the times, but I had to do it. My phone has a camera. It's right there. I can't have two cameras. You don't understand. The camera quality meme continues. Congratulations, everyone. Feel free to roast me. I don't care. I don't care. I never actually cared. Whenever I watch a video with 8K quality, I go, ""Oh, wow. Video has great quality. That's it. I completely forget about it. It doesn't matter. What do you want from me?"" I'll upload 240p if I have to. The  trust me, I'll use Bandy Cam if I have to. Do you want me to be the studio polish YouTuber that everyone is? No. This is good. This is good enough. Japan has taught me this. Okay. They use fax machines over here. First time you hear about it and most people don't get it, but I get it. It works. Microphone. I don't need a whole spalunk. It sounds fine. It's I need eight GPUs. It's compartmentamentalized. Don't you understand? It's one thing. It does it doesn't count. It is not a ball. Don't ball me on my computer. I need eight GPUs. You don't. I have nine actually now, by the way. I will not compromise my principles. God damn it. Now, you may have looked around in my room and be like, ""Okay, well, why do you have all this stuff then? Isn't that a camera, Felix?"" Yeah, but I built it. Then, it means something to me. That's the whole point. It's okay to have stuff if I like it. I only keep books that I feel like I have at least something to say about. I don't keep books just to keep them. This is uh any book here I can yap about. And that's kind of the point. I have I I bought this figurine and I'm like, what's the point of this? And I'm like, well, I like it. I guess it's so it's okay. There are things I just like to have for the sake of having them. Everyone's going to go, ""Oh, he's going through a midlife crisis."" No, midlife flourish. I baited you all with the thumbnail. You got God. It's actually a stoic principle to not be too attached to things, but rather be appreciative of the time that you had them. Uh, this can go to more than just items, but relationships and uh, yeah, other people in general to not cling to things that you can't control. I think my YouTube awards are a good example. I was very happy when I got them, but do I need to own them my entire life because of it? No. I'm very glad I don't have to hog them around every any place I go. Why would I do that? You get my point. It's so funny cuz I've been debating all of these choices for so long and I, you know, I finally decided to do it because of the Google video where I deooled and I was like, hm, what is this feeling? It feels good to live by your principles. That's right. I'm a changed man. I'm a principled man. A small sacrifice to be authentic to yourself, I think, is worth it. But I realize it takes time and effort, and I still got a long way to go. Members was another example. I don't know if you guys saw, I recently shut down members. People were literally paying me to do nothing. I didn't have time to keep uh posting members because I don't have that time anymore since becoming a dad. And I asked members and they were like, ""Bro, we just want to support you. We don't care."" And I was like, ""What the what?"" And then I asked other YouTubers. I'm like, ""What should I do?"" And they were like, ""Bro, if they are paying you, just take it. It just doesn't sit right with me."" So, even if a lot of this might seem self sabotagish, the value of living true to myself is the whole point. Even if it means you seem a little crazy, but you know who seemed a little crazy? Diagon. And I think we can all be a bit more alike. Thank you for listening to me. Yap as always, and the Bruff. >> All right, so NordVPN data center >> has teamed up. >> One man harbors a secret agenda. >> You won't believe this. >> While the Avengers infiltrate a secret weapons facility. >> I can't believe this. Witted foe from the Avengers past awaits. Can the Avengers defeat a foe who can adapt and mimic their own powers and abilities? NordVPN and the Avengers. >> There it is. NordVPN. Defend yourself online. This is how you defend yourself. NordVPN has teamed up with Marvel. That's right. You heard that right. They even released a comic book together. Bern, I'm recording promo. As someone who recently fell down the tech rabbit hole, you need a NordVPN. No matter what level you're on, you should always use a VPN. You're using a VPN right now because I know if you're not doing it. If you're not using a VPN, then everything you do click or intentionally or unintentionally can be seen by someone else.

Going back and we're going to have some dinner. Almost had lunch. Have some barbecue. >> Oh, yes. >> Water. The man wasn't real. Just like garden man [Music] wants to grab the moon. You can do it. Can you take the moon? Can you grab it? [Music] [Music] Dogs are loving it here. So cute. Oh my gosh. Momo so fast. [Music] We're in Chosi. It's like the like a heel of the eastern side of Japan that sticks out. So, we're stopping by the lighthouse. It's really pretty around here. 300 yen. Love a good lighthouse, right? What do you think behind? Are you going to climb the stairs on your own or are you going to make us carry you? That was a heavier. No, there's more. No. Oh, this is tight. Beer. [Music] Water is just beating the rocks up. Look, it's our car. It looks so small from here. You did it. >> We're taking it slow. [Music] [Music] So, we were by the lighthouse and I saw this beautiful temple. So, we're going to check it out from the lighthouse I saw. [Music] Look at this hall. You should come here. There's a space to pray to each god all the way. I never seen something like this. [Music] Are you scared at all? [Music] >> Is it fun? [Music] [Applause] >> And another one. Woo. [Music] Look, bug. >> Yay. No way. No way. That's amazing. Oh my god. It's like the puzzle. That's perfect. Oo. You put those back actually. >> Can you You can put that back in there. >> Put it back. [Music] Look [Music] >> at this. Should we show it? >> Mhm. >> Can we show it? Who's that? >> You have your own book, Bang. So M has been working for a long time on this book for Bern and it's packed with so many different things. It's amazing. I didn't think they could do all the stuff. The We're going through the first sample now. >> Yay. >> It's so fun to see it. [Music] Um, two-year-olds will definitely love it, but I I think younger for sure as well, like or even older for sure as well. [Music] >> What's the moon? >> Yeah. What about the stars? >> Yeah. >> You did great. >> Thank you. >> Well done. Super proud of you. >> Happy birthday. >> Happy birthday. >> Happy birthday. [Music] Look at you guys. Today is mama's birthday. Three years already. It's crazy. [Music] >> Happy birthday, mama. What a good boy. [Music] What are you saying there? Do you hear people? People. [Music] Look how so many bees. Ew. We should probably get out of here, huh? Look how many bees. We're not catching bugs again, but that' be too easy. B, I see one. Oh, that's an easy catch. Easy catch. Bern, we caught something there. Look, we caught another bug. Oh no, we are locked on this one. Are you ready, Baron, for your first catch? It thinks we're walking by. We're not walking by. Oh, we got him. We got him. We did it. We did it. Look at it. We caught one. Whoa. So disgusting. Bug. Big bug. This is POV. You're a big bug and Bern looks down on you. Now we bring it home to mama. She's going to be so happy. Go PM. What do we think? Did we set him free? >> Yeah, let's set him free. Bye bag. That was fun. [Music] >> Oh, like two kitties. >> Say that again, Gary. What did you just say? Say it again. Mama mia. Were you going to say something? >> Mama mia. >> Mama mia. [Music] >> Oh, nice pants. Did mama make those pants? That's your diaper. Oh, >> first time me and N are out together in a month. We had no babysitter, so we're having sushi. I'm sushi heaven. This is so good. Look at this. Oh, it's ready. [Music] >> We're going to draw together cuz we we got a collab coming where me and Marca are going to draw an artwork together. So, you're going to draw the background >> and I'll draw the >> something. [Music] The sound of end of summer. There's different cicas. And this is the end one, right? Yeah, it is. A lot of dog birthdays recently. Today is Mach's birthday. She's one years old now. [Music] >> Monte has been at Okay. [Music] That is awesome. We met a dog and she gave me her Instagram. Check out Choco, everyone. We looked more at the business card. So, the head is shaped like a heart and then he turned around the business card. The butt is shaped like a heart. Choco is a little naughty. I think Momo and Eggy are going to be so pissed when they watch this vlog. They're going to be like, ""They, you took her out."" Sorry. Should we calm down a little bit? >> Oh my god. 11 goals. These poor children are getting destroyed. [Music] >> Dan, where are we? We're at Sujito. We've been one time me and Bern, but me and M have been trying to go here for like three times now, and it's always been crazy line, like 40 minutes, an hour. There they are. They came. That looks good. We are at the aquarium in Kawasaki. We've been here a long time ago, man. You probably don't remember it. Well, he definitely doesn't. Oh, wow. Do you remember you were a baby when we were here and we thought we would wow you and you just didn't care at all and we were so tired back then. Oh my god, we were so tired. [Music] Look how big they are. I want to choke them just like Whoa. What did you catch? What is that? >> Oh, [Music] where's the fish? Be >> fish. Yes. Goodbye fish. >> Yes. Goodbye fish. Bye-bye fish. [Music] We should film this. >> D loves it. >> Me too. That's very cute. That's super cute. I love it. What is that? That is crazy. That's borderline abomination. What is that? Oh my god. [Music] as much surprised me. What is it? >> A fridge. >> Which ice cream do you want? This one. [Music] We're going to fix up Bern's uh crib a little bit cuz he keeps rolling out of it. Right, B? Can you measure it for me? Yes. Perfect. Now I know how long it is. We're going to saw this one next actually. So that's [Music] Gibba. I'm working out with Ven. It's so cute. Hey, Ven. You are so cute. Hey, show everyone you can lsit. Ready? Go. Oh, you want to film it? Okay. Okay, I got it. I got it. Bren wanted to set up the camera like a tripod and film himself working out. It was a good form to be fair. If you had a form like that, you want to show it off. >> Damn. You know, so many workout tools again. >> Let's look what mama made us. What did mama make? Oh, burrito. But that's my burrito. You get Huh? >> This is yours. >> No. >> No. You want mine? They haven't even looked at yours. Don't you have the best mom ever, Bern? >> Oh, we have to remove the fork. Of course. Now you take. Yes. What do you think of that? Okay. Yeah, that looks good. That looks good. Are you ready? >> That was terrible. [Applause] [Music] Oh my god. Yes. That's how you know you married a gamer. >> Where's the game? You bought me You said you bought me the game. Where's the game? >> Today's our anniversary. We had a beautiful day. We did a midday celebration and now because we only have babysitter during the day, promise not to shoot mama. Okay. Do not shoot mama. [Applause] [Music] He's stabbing me as well. What are you two doing? Is that part of the plan to shoot me and stab me? [Music] Nice. >> Yes. Yes. Yes. Come on. Yes. Match it. Nice. You got it. Come on. A. It's so close. >> Yeah. Two. One. >> Can you shoot again? >> He knows his routine. >> These are a little difficult to put on on their own. >> Hello. >> Hello. Hi. You're so funny. >> Hello. >> Hello. >> Hello, Pete. I was clearing up outside in the garden and Bern was helping me. We were in the shade for like 30 minutes and I am drenched. Be absolutely cooked. Japan heat is no joke, man. Sheesh. Ridiculous. And the dogs are like, ""Take us out for a walk."" And I'm like, ""You're going to evaporate instantly."" And then they're like, ""We want to go anyway. So, I take them out and then two seconds later they're like, ""It's too hot. We have to go back inside now. It's tough."" Sheesh. Nice job. Yeah. You already know how to do it. Yes, you remember from last time. Not a bad moment. That's my boy right there. That was so cool. W. [Music] That was so close. [Music] It's alive. >> Well done, Ben. Not so fast. >> Potato. [Music] Look at this. It's a Shimagiro show. A friend of ours is hosting it. A lot of kids. [Music] >> Y is having a great time. You're allowed to film with this or take photos of this today. Doo doo doo doo doo doo. Mommy shark. Doo doo doo doo doo doo. Mommy shark. [Music] [Applause] Okay, next. Let's dance. [Music] Pan started counting randomly in Japanese, but not from zero. Oh, here go. Enjoy your life. [Laughter] >> We're re-watching the vlogs. It's really cute. I remember that cuz those stamps never we couldn't use them anyway. Uh oh no, Be is awake.

2JzOe1Hs26Q,"A few months ago, I built my very first gaming PC. Felix, it started a whole journey of me installing Linux, writing my very first line of code, completely deging, running my own self-host. But there's one truth that I can't escape. In order to successfully ascend, I need more compute. The less I touch grass, the more I touch the clouds. That's right. I'm building a new computer. So, let's talk specs. I got the Pro VS X90E. This motherboard is huge. It says Nihango Questto Gaido. That means good luck. Gajun. I got the AMD thread 7975. There it is. Don't ask how much I spent to power this. I got 130 W. God damn. I actually got two of them. Two pisu. Fun fact, these two generate as much as um an average Japanese household. I am sorry. Storage. [Music] I spent so much on everything. I had to save money somewhere. God damn. 96 GB of RAM. And that's only half as much as I need. You don't understand. I'm going to space. I'm not playing around now. GPUs. Has everyone lost their goddamn minds? What are these prices? I look everywhere. I cannot find a GPU that doesn't cost my soul. And I'm not even asking for that much for it. I recently traveled to Sweden and Italy and I thought, ""Oh, I could like get a good deal then. Maybe Japan is the problem."" No, it's everyone. There were so many variables to consider when sourcing GPUs that I was going crazy. I I just like there's what the I even read a bot. I put in a script that would scan the market for GPUs and that way I could maybe then consider what what the best option is to get least amount of screwed. And then the bot kept spitting out these weird lines of URLs. I'm like what the [Â __Â ] is this? What is this? This means nothing. This is gibberish. And then I realized oh these are antibbot measurements. I am the problem that I'm trying to solve. God damn it. Ultimately, I settled for these Love Lace RTX 4000. These are not exciting graphics card. But, but if you get seven of If you get seven of them, then it gets interesting. They have 20 GB of VRAM. Great. For cooling, I use an A all-in-one cooler. Looks a bit suspicious. The the front panel fell off. Okay. Now, if Marcia asks, ""How much did you spend on all of this? This seems crazy."" I prepared a script, and I need you to memorize this in case she double checks you to verify it. This has to be rock solid. Okay. All right. Here we go. Well, it is not about how much it cost, but how much it saves. You see, a build of this caliber replaces the need for cloud computation. At current market rates for, let's say, $2 per GPU, multiplied by seven GPUs, we run this for 8 hours a day, 6 months. Bing, bada boom, this thing is paid for itself. Well, you see, the math doesn't lie. Okay, that would be around $20,160. Poof, evaporated to the cloud. Now, that would just be irresponsible spending, wouldn't it? This is way better. All of this, I get full privacy. I don't get the risk of getting throttled. And even the best, no one can ban me for using too many slurs. Not that I would do that. So, yeah, if you could say all that to Marsia, that'd be great. Thank you. And Marcia, another way to pay for this video is thanks to sponsor G-Fuel. I have the biggest G-Fuel announcement ever. I'm the first one to break the news. They trusted me with it. About a month ago, they took me to the secret G-Fuel dungeon and I got to try the fountain of youth. The new impro Gfuel formula to the new era of GFuel. Beautiful. That's actually Yeah, that is better. How is it possible? What did you do? You can tell here in the in the first one there's a little there's a little thumb part at the bottom. Look at this. Smooth all the way. The mad wizards at GFuel, they did it perfect perfection. And ever since I've been drinking the 2.0 version when I know there's 3.0 G-Fuel out there. It is better. I don't know how they did it. They improved perfection, but it's smoother tasting. It's less chalky. It's better better. And did I say it's better tasting? Pewdiepie lingo berry was already the greatest flavor of all time, but now it's better. I'm being serious. I'm using my I'm trying to sell you voice, but I am also being authentic. You will like this drink. The formula is coming soon in September. Soon in September. So don't miss it out. It comes shipped with my flavor, PewDiePie Linger Berry, of course, but also Miami Nights and Hype Sauce. Check out the link in the description. As you guys know, I love G-Fuel and I think you guys are going to love this drink as well. But most importantly, thank you for paying for all this. All right. So, the power draw is a little bit of an issue. I actually have to contact an electrician. He came by today. And uh yes, it looks like I'm screwed. That's why, of course, I'm planning to go solar. I need more power. And uh apparently sourcing weapon grade plutonium isn't legal. So, this machine is going green. Last but not least, the case. My last computer drove me insane. I had it's a mini ITX or whatever. The thing annoyed me. That's all that matters. I was building this thing as a complete noob. Millimeter difference made that parts just wasn't compatible. And that to me makes no sense. If you're building a computer, parts should be interchangeable. Where's my goddamn versatility? I recently changed GPU on it and poof, the case doesn't fit anymore. Great. I changed it to an open air case and I'm like that looks damn good. I don't have to worry about space and beautiful airflow. I get that uh collecting dust is a bit of a problem, but it's breathing the same air I'm breathing. It's fine. I don't want to put all this spaceship hardware into a shoe box. Okay. So, I'm building my own case this time so I can have full freedom for do I want. I have never built my own case before. This might be a disaster. We're about to find out. Let's build this goddamn thing. Welcome to the floor. This is where I will spend most of today. I'm planning to use these aluminum extrusions. The size is 3030. I have never built with these before. The reason I picked these is cuz they're strong, they're lightweight, and relatively cheap. I got it from a local Japanese company. So, without further ado, let's channel my IKEA energy and uh I'm going to try and get the frame started. First, I uh tested out the layout, see what was the best way to do it. I even made a 3D model of the planks. Uh so, I started putting pieces together and I made the frame. It all looked great. Okay, the frame is done. And you get my toe in this shot as well. I think this is going to look nice. I like the black coating. It looks good. I'm getting positive vibes. Then I realized I had to make my own holes into this metal. You can make your own screw holes by tapping. I never done this before. So I was terrible at it. This method, it required so much precision to fit the motherboard properly. And I realized I don't have that kind of precision. So I had to figure out a different method. You just have to use this barbecue secret sauce and it works like butter. Just got to do this thousand times. No big deal. I laid out the PSUs the way I was going to do it. Originally, I was planning to keep them on the sides, but I figured a more optimal version. Okay, the PSU mount is finished. Best part, I can do that. And I think for like for what it is, it fits pretty well. These are actually meant for fans. I just need something to hold in case there's an earthquake. I just couldn't find actual PSU holders that would didn't take 6 years to arrive to Japan. So, I had the my guy written. I think all in all, not bad. I had to figure out where how to mount the cooler as well. With this build, I could just put all the GPUs together like a giant GPU cheeseburger, but that's a terrible idea. So, I'm planning to have one down, one up, one down, one up, one down, one up, so that they give space to breathe. The GPU brackets I bought just didn't fit at all, so I had to figure out a different way to do it. Luckily, working with aluminum is quite easy once you get the hang of it. You can move anything around, just flap it about. But it meant I had to make my own GPU bracket, which is fine. And I will have to tap that one because I can just move everything around. I kept rebuilding it. I kept thinking, ""Oh, it's better if this one goes there and this one goes there."" So, okay. So, I guess you could say this is version number three. I keep changing it cuz I keep finding better ways to optimize it. It's a lot of extra work, but I I don't mind doing it, and I feel like a build like this deserves a proper thought and attention to it. So, it's going to be good. I just have to redo everything for the fourth time. All right, nearly there. Got the layout laid out. I just got to drill the holes and I got to cut these and then after that, yeah, should be pretty good. But finally, I knew more or less and it was time to saw. That was loud. I was not prepared for how loud that was. This project took forever because I kept running into stupid problems like screws being the wrong size. I keep messing up the dumbest things. I finally have all the standoffs all in place, but the screws are too big. These are like M4 or M M5. I I guess I need 4.5 or four. It's so annoying. It's so annoying. Oh my god, I already waited so long for this. Like, I can't do anything until the motherboard is in place. So, I'm kind of stuck now. I guess I can put on some the RAM and the SD. Ah, it's okay. It don't matter. I don't care. The electrical socket not fitting my plugs. Everything just took another day because it's like uh uh and I kept rebuilding it and changing it. But it was finally time to put the motherboard in. I finally get to put in the motherboard properly cuz I I only had like five of these. I needed five more. Who cares? It going in this bad boy. Why is it so uneven? [Music] There we go. Okay. Me other mounted pesos mounted. It was worth the extra effort cuz I think this is going to come out looking nice. It's good. It's good. Is good. Everything good. Anyway, we're going to install the fans. I got no top. These are the best of the base. I'm going to put this on the uh AIO. I bet the screws are wrong for this ones, too. They actually might be now I'm worried about I mounted the storage. Next up, my memory. Sorry, my storage. Damn. Damn, son. Which one is slot one then? I have no idea. Okay, you do that and then you slide it. Boom. And then this you don't have to peel as well, but I'm going to do it just for fun cuz I like peeling things. Question is, do I have to peel all of them? Even if there's nothing there, I don't think so. Nailed it. the ram and I was terrified to click too hard. I don't know why. You just have to push with both hands, dummy. Okay, I'm not going to lie. You kind of have to shove them in there. That's kind of violent. There you go. That was good. That was clean. Four out of eight. I realized I didn't peel off the stickers. Are you kidding me? I really didn't want to remake all the mistakes I made on my first computer build, so I was like, ""This time I'm going to read the instructions. surprise. It didn't do any difference. I put in the CPU and then I added the cooler and it was really terrifying because the CPU is it's really expensive. This is too much money for an idiot like me to handle. But here we go. Oh god, [Music] it's sliding. It has a slid. I removed the cover. We put it down. See, that doesn't look like it even fits. Okay, there we go. There you go. The CPU is the most expensive part of this build, so I was terrified of messing this up. And of course, I mess it up. The problem wasn't the how I mounted the CPU. It was how I mounted the cooler. I thought I shouldn't screw it too tight because then it might be like not good and kill it. >> Obviously, we don't want to overtighten it. >> So, when it finally came to booting it, it just didn't boot because it didn't detect the CPU cooler because I didn't screw it tight enough. And it took me a long time to figure that out. That's worth a little problem solving for you. Well, I damn. I didn't expect it to work to be honest. You're looking at 600,000 cables and any one of them could be the problem. I flashed the drive. I was going to use Iuntu this time around because it has better driver compatibility and I don't feel like installing ours for the fifth time this year. Sue me. Another issue I ran into was a lot of the GPUs just didn't work and I didn't understand why. You see that? That's the first time I get more than one GPU showing up. What did I do differently this time? I don't [Â __Â ] know. I don't know. >> I kept thinking it was the motherboard, but it turns out I didn't click in the cables properly. It's like the biggest noob mistake ever. Just like make sure the cables are in. The amount of problems I ran into with this build. Nothing was smooth. Nothing. So then it was time to check out the drivers. Guess what? The drivers don't work either. Well, why don't you eat my But finally, all the GPUs were detected and the drivers worked glorious and I could finally do what I set out to do, which is run all these six GPUs that I had parallel as one strong unit. The problem is I didn't know a [Â __Â ] all about tensor parallelism. Okay, you can only run tensor parallelisms by the power of two. I had six. It ain't linear. You know how there's Nintendo 64? Well, they ain't no Nintendo 72. You can't run six. You can't run TP6, but you can run TP4. So, I actually sold two of the GPUs. Yeah, I could run Llama 3 70B 70 billion parameters. That's pretty cool. It's a very strong model. And I can offload some of the RAM even on my system RAM. That's pretty cool. It's a lot of RAM. Felt like the reasonable and smart thing to do in my situation. Except that's what not what I did at all. Gamblers's fallacy. I have gone this far. I'm not going to stop now. I got two more GPUs. God damn it. Eight GPUs to roll them all. Lucky I went with a double pesu cuz there's no more PCIe on this one. I need one more. I don't know how to describe this feeling, but I feel like I've done something that I was not supposed to do. I look at this thing and I get scared. There's boss music playing in the background when I'm hooking this up. Six was okay. Eight is just get it's just getting bonkers. I don't know. It's ridicul. I don't know if it's going to run. I don't know if it's going to work. Will it detect all the jeep get poos? I don't know. And you may have looked at my rig and maybe you're like a super detective and super genius or something, but my board has seven slots. How are you going to fit eight on there? Easy. I had looked this up. Bifurcation. It basically means you can split one of your PCIe slots into half and you can fit two GPUs on therea I'm being ironically cringe but by being that I'm actually cringe. Okay, let's just cut that. This is perfect. This solves all my problem. I just plug in two GPUs and I'm done with it. I get to eight. Basically, what that means is I don't have to buy like a server grade motherboard that costs $5,000 and change out my entire CPU and all that, you know, like the price will just get ridiculous. So, if I can just change the settings in my BIOS, I can do it. So, I completed my goal, which has just been a goal for no reason. Like, I don't even care, but I have to do this now. But to my surprise, my motherboard doesn't do 8x8 by fication. Why? I don't know. Why not? Why? Why aces? Other cards do it that you used to do it. Just do it. Just put it the thing. I looked up everywhere online. You can get cards that actively do it for you, but they're super expensive. That that goes against the whole plan. You can just do it if you just add it. I thought I was crazy. I was like, ""Okay, surely no one tries to really maximize their motherboard like I'm trying to do now."" That's why we have this issue. I find a thread online. There are other people out there just like me. They're crazy. They're all complaining. Why, Asus? Why? [Â __Â ] This pisses me off, man. So, I looked up. There's so many Chinese cards that say, ""Yeah, we split your in Chinese accent, but that's racist."" So, instead, I do like a little like, ""Yeah, we do it."" Maybe they literally say that. You read I look for hours for the product and I'm like, ""This is it. I found it, Martia."" And then I read the fine print. It's like, ""Oh, but maybe uh yes, this is gen 4 speed. Don't worry, but maybe it will be gen 3."" I'm like, ""How the [Â __Â ] can you say that? It either is or isn't. I got computers and binaries. I'm not I'm not going to risk it."" So, okay, there are cards that can do it. Maybe cost like 500, 600 bucks. But I live in Japan and they got to ship on board and it's going to take me another 2 weeks and I'm just like, I just want to finish this [Â __Â ] thing. So, I found I found a guy. Okay, I found a guy that has the BIOS. He says he has the BIOS. There's a forum thread and he's like, ""Guys, I got the BIOS. I asked ASUS for the bios."" So, I'm asking the guy, ""Give me the bios."" I never thought I would be the kind of person that looks through forums and asks someone for their what the what kind of sketchy [Â __Â ] is this? I got to ask people for bios now from a random person on the internet and in a forum thread that allegedly has it. That's where I am right now. And I'm not finishing this until I completed my goal. I got the message. He wrote me. The random person on the internet sent me their bios. Asus didn't respond whatsoever. But the guy sent me his bios. I was so excited like a kid on Christmas. I flashed the BIOS. The light kept blinking forever. I was stressing out. Is it going to work? It's the random guy that sent me the BIOS going to work. I checked out his profile, by the way, and he seemed like a good person. I I really feel like uh this is not some elaborate way of hacking my computer. It just seemed like a someone that genuinely wanted to help, but who knows? Finally, the BIOS stopped blinking and they were done. I booted up and bada bing bada boom. >> It actually booted. A go to a zero, please. >> Uh maybe. Yeah. Okay, it actually booted. Oh my god. It all comes down. I I forgot the command cuz I'm so nervous. Oh, it worked. Oh, yes. Yes. [Music] Hey, finally. Okay, now we're going to get a whole I'm going to get all [Â __Â ] eight of them to work and they're going to they're going to sweat. I'm going to make them pain. You're going to be in pain. I cannot mount them like this. I literally just like panic did everything. I can't believe it. I did it. I did it. I did it. Stubbornness whims. Eight. Everything works. They are all working. They're working together. Together the brains. 8* 8 bifurcation works. No thanks to you, Acus. Well, technically, but not really. Okay. I've been running this for a couple days now, and it is great. I am so happy how this turned out. It was worth all the effort. I had three concerns before the build, which Oh, Bern is here. Hi, Bern. I'm wrapping up the video. Do you want to go through the ending? Number one was the noise. You can barely hear it, right? Number two was the power consumption. I vastly overestimated the power consumption. Idle, these GPUs sit at 150 watts, which is nothing, right, Bern? He's enamored by this. >> Okay, go to your mama. It's too distract. You're too cute. I'm still glad I got the double pisu, but it doesn't need it whatsoever. Uh, the last was uh temperature. I was really worried it was going to get too hot, but the open air case works and the whole staggered method with the GPUs works. It all works. TP8 works. I have eight working GPUs without losing speed. That's the big caveat. And without spending a billion dollars. That's the big caveat. Now I can run all of these computers together as one. What am I going to do with that? I don't know. I just set this goal for myself because I knew it could be done. And by the kindness of a random stranger online and a lot of perseverance, [Music] I made it happen cuz I knew it could. I knew it was possible. And it feels so goddamn good. Tech stuff is like Dark Souls. All right. There's this imaginary difficulty that you set out for yourself. People ask, ""Why do you play that game? It's just difficult."" It's like, but that's what makes it fun when you manage to overcome it. Okay, I know it's not real. It's just a video game. It's the same thing. I'm calling this computer Odysius because I was reading uh the Iliad at the time, which is one of my favorite books, and the translation called Odysius, the Always Thinking, which is what I want this computer to do. But the name fit even better because this thing is cursed. I mean, look at it. And you know, just like Odysius, it took a long time to get home in the end, but we got there. No matter what obstacles were thrown at us, we got there in the end. This was supposed to be a simple video. I hope you guys enjoyed it. That's it. Thank you guys for watching and I'll look forward to share the next project with you guys. Profess. >> Oh, thank you, man. >> You threw a t-shirt on me. Thank you, Baron. >> Yeah, it's a t-shirt. >> All right, so me and Marcia, we love to travel. We go back to Italy and Sweden every year. What used to be a problem was figuring out how to get internet. Now there is SY, an eim service that is so good, you have to try out. No more Wi-Fi renting and returning. No more finding where they sell SIMs and then you have to remember to have the key and then not lose your original SIM. It's terrible. Whatever we used to do, those days are over. You just download SY. You can do this right now if you have a trip coming up. Set up uh which country you're traveling to, how much data you want to use, and then you don't even have to think about it. Once you land, it will automatically connect to you and you use one eim for all countries. Super smooth, super simple. Both me and Marcia love using it. And if you enter code pewdiepie and you just save money 15%. You're welcome. Last thing is also with privacy. Sale is part of the Nord umbrella which is a privacy respecting company. A lot of eim companies are not. So keep that in mind. Yeah. Just thank you SA for being an amazing sponsor and amazing product that I genuinely love. Thank you. Check it out. Link in description.

It's so funny cuz we have some free time without beer, but you're still like, ""Ah, if was he could have gone there and he could chin chin chin chin. [Music] Bern, what are you doing with that? >> Today is habata in Japan where you take you take a bamboo and you put you write down your wish on a piece of paper and you decorate it on the bamboo. Kind of like a Christmas tree. Now that I think about it, a wishmiss bamboo tree. You prepared them. That's so cute. They're really pretty. Tonabata. You usually see them on shopping streets uh or people hang them outside their house and stuff like that. It's I think uh it's like a kindergarten activity too probably. Do you think Japanese spirits speak English or do we have to Oh my god. Thank you, Bern. You can write your own wish. This is going to be so pretty. [Music] >> Happy birthday. >> Yes. [Music] The best goal. All right, let's see the score. MVP. Dragon Lord. No, I got MVP. But you were close. Three goals, girl. [Music] The plot thickens. It's insane. Now it landed. >> Oh, it's so pretty. Oh, if you can land on the Wait for it. [Music] What do I do now? >> Is it chilling? Okay, good. >> Look. >> We out of the We got other stuff right now. >> Look.

If you watch my videos recently, uh, you've seen that I hate subscriptions. 20 bucks for 100 gig. I don't think so. I'm not going to pay you to hold my data hostage forever. Not happening. And I replace all my subscriptions with my self-host on Steam Day. But there were some services that are just generally too good to run for free. The number one, of course, being NordVPN. I've tried free VPNs. They are terrible. It's a service that I'm genuinely happy to pay for because what they provide is actually amazing. With NordVPN, you can connect to anywhere in the world, almost any country. If you gone through the same rabbit hole as me, it will be like, ""Wo, I can connect to Netflix, any country, or anime. That's so cool."" The next stage is my ISB is watching everything I do. Advertisers, they steal my data. man in the middle attacks. They still it. They're all watching. It is true though. On your home network, you should still use NordVPN obviously, but if you ever connect to a public Wi-Fi or anything like that, please use a VPN. It's a terrible idea to not do it. Otherwise, you leave yourself open to all kinds of different attacks getting hacked and the damage can be really, really detrimental. You don't want to deal with it. Just make sure you protect yourself today. And don't worry, I got you covered. If you go to nordvpn.com/pie, you get the best deal. You get a huge bonus on a two-year plan with a four additional months bonus for free. It's a great deal. Take advantage of it because NorVPN is a product that I use. And even if it's a subscription, it's a cheap and crude service that I stand genuinely stand by. So, I'm proud to promote NordVPN, a privacy respecting company that keeps you safe online.

yzSBeCJfhkw,"[Music] So, it's me and Ken versus Rainbow. How did we end up here? >> I don't know. >> For those of you who don't know, for whatever reason, Rainbow is like God of this game. >> This is Belgian. >> Why could I tell that was Belgian? >> Me. I All I have to help me is this American. I'm doomed. >> I'm also American, so it's it's all good. >> That's right. I want everyone to know at home that that it's taking us 45 minutes with Felix just to get Discord to work. That's how great of a chance that we have of winning. >> I'm going to take Guy now. I can't get to work. >> All right, lock in. Good luck. Good luck. Good luck. Good luck. Good luck. >> All right, Ken. Is he muted now? We can talk trash. >> This should be fun. I don't think they've played in like 5 years, so I mean, we're playing moving. I'm not going to move. I'm just going to sit here in NPZ, but at least we'll see it in the first round here. >> Ken, I'm sorry about the American comment. I'm sure if we work together, we can solve. >> Yeah. So, this is pretty obviously Turkey. We can see here these are like Turkish ballards. >> Look, we're in America right now. I recognize this anywhere. How do you know? Big roads with nothing around it. Well, they're on the right side of the road. >> We're just going to get turkey. >> And we're already running out of time. The screen is red. Ah, there's only 26 seconds left. Felix, where are we? >> I have 30 seconds. I don't know how good they are, so I don't want to play too try hardy right now. I think as the video goes on, we might like try 0.1 seconds, but we'll see. >> I'm driving against traffic, kid. I don't know what's going on. I'm going with traffic. I'm going the other way. Oh, okay. >> They do have a language here, so that language could help them to get in Turkey, but I don't know if they'll recognize it as Turkish. >> It just like says like Kardashian something. What does that mean? Bassan Kardashian coin. Okay, Ken, you're This is your territory. You have to guess this. It's not my territory, Felix. Woo! Wait, I didn't even guess. This is not even America. What? You didn't even guess. I got close, but you had no one in Libya. And the other person didn't guess. Okay, Felix did not guess. Hopefully, he's able to. This is Malaysia. So, we have black and white. We have a black sticker right there, which means we're going to be in mainland Malaysia. >> Oh, this is Brazil. >> So, I just click center here. We have 30 seconds after I guess >> Hawaii or something. >> No, it's Brazil. >> This is Brazil. >> It's in Manau. Or maybe I should look around a bit. Damn. 30 seconds is not enough. >> Maybe I can up the time after this if they want. >> You got Brazil locked in. >> It's probably like also like I'm like trying to be chill and then you like cut to like them and it's probably like I just know their coms are going like absolutely like berserk probably or like >> Stop. Stop. Stop. How does the game work? Can do I pick? Do you pick? We're both picking. >> You got to guess. Okay. Singapore. >> Oh, was that black sticker in uh Borneo? Okay, that's new. >> We lost. We We lost. We lost. How did you know? >> Ken, what the hell happened? >> I did my best. Okay. >> You said it was America. You don't even know your own country. >> Yeah, then I guess and got sort of kind of close. >> If Sweden shows up, I will be the first to know. I would never the little wiener country shows up. That's all you got? Oh, >> did we win? >> Unfortunately, you didn't. >> No, he lost. >> Yeah, you lost. But the way the guessing does work, it takes the closest guess. >> And it took mine twice, Felix. I was the closest twice. >> I was surprised you got one wrong. So, we had a chance. We have a chance. It's not impossible. Ken, >> it was It was the right country. It was the right country. It's just a different island. You know, that was the new DLC that just dropped that. I I haven't learned >> the new DLC. You know, the meta hadn't been locked in yet. All right. All right. >> I'm just saying we weren't locked in either. I was not locked in at all. All right. We're going to get you next round. I know it. >> Sure. Sure. Sure. Okay. Okay. That's fair. I I did 30 more seconds. So, after I guess, you guys get 1 minute. >> No, no, no. I don't need more than 30. I don't want to talk to Ken that long. How dare you. >> Okay, it's 30 seconds. >> It's okay. We got to work together now. We can do this. Okay. Okay. I'm ready. >> We panic way too much. We got to keep it cool. >> Round one. What we got? Okay, so this is like actually like in his neck of the woods. See, I wonder if they know >> this is America. This is America and we're in the middle of nowhere. I mean, obviously that's the Georgia Georgia state outline. >> We got trash happening everywhere, >> but these reflectors right here are also only found on the outside in Georgia and and Florida. >> We're by the Lowry Firehouse. Golly, boy, we are out here in the sticks. >> The front plate in Georgia doesn't have license plates, so they're obviously going to get this. But yeah, >> this looks like where I was in like around Georgia, Alabama. I'm not going to lie to you. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I agree. North. It goes north 19. Does that help you? >> No. No. No, it doesn't. >> Do you pick Mississippi? >> Yeah. Yeah. I' I've kind of like stuck it in between. Yeah. Yeah. >> I'll go closer to Alabama. >> Maybe Tennessee, too. I don't know. It's kind of Oh, what is that? Windham. Where's Windham at? 1877. It's not It's not here. [Music] >> Didn't I say Georgia? What? Holy. >> Okay. Um, they did get, you know, the US at least, so that's good. >> Dang. All the way out there in Georgia. What the hell? That's crazy. That's like the only place in America I've driven through. And I was like, that looks like it. >> Okay. Um, >> what is it? Where's this? >> This looks like it's going to be Bolivia. >> What is this? Like Area 51? >> Yeah. What the hell? >> Let me see if I can show you guys. I think this should just be Bolivia. Should I just guess? >> He's not He's not winning by that much. We can do this. We just got to use our brain. They got some uh religious stuff on the road like Christian. So, it's got to be a Christian country. Kome it's KKM. So it's not America. Okay. Definitely not America. >> Could it be South America? South America somewhere. >> I don't think they're going to get quite get to Bolivia. They could get to South America, but >> what's clay like this? Like red clay. >> Mexico. >> I have no idea. Could it be Mexico? >> Maybe. >> You're going with Mexico? >> Yeah, I'll go Mexico. >> Oh, I almost didn't guess. >> Um, they were in the Americas, but it's game again, unfortunately. >> I almost clicked there. I almost clicked in that spot. No. >> Yeah, but you didn't. You didn't click on that spot. What the hell does that even mean? >> I thought you was going to click somewhere else. I thought you was going to click somewhere else. Oh, Mexico. Then you'll pick something else. But you just click right. >> Yeah, but I thought we were working together. I didn't know we could pick different things. >> We are. But we we we have we can like tell me that communicate. >> But he told us earlier. >> Yeah, but I didn't listen. >> Yeah. So, it went pretty well that time. You know, we uh pretty confident. >> I could Yeah, that was You got You got the Southern US vibes. That was good. Yeah, I always way way up there in Georgia. >> How are we doing? Honestly, are we impressing you? >> Uh, I think getting the right getting the right, you know, western hemisphere on the last guest was impressive. >> Yeah, >> a little bit. >> I I like how you guys both I like how you guys both commit to Mexico, though. That was You guys must have really thought it was >> because he asked me, he's like, ""You clicking Mexico?"" Like, ""Yeah, I'm clicking Mexico."" And he's like, ""Me, too."" >> I don't even know. He didn't tell me. No, he's influencing me. He's >> He's Don't get gaslighting me. That's what he's doing. I had better guesses. Don't let Felix win one. You'll never hear the end of it for the rest of your life. >> All right. >> From now on, Ken, we might be on the same team, but we're not on the same team. Okay, I'll tell you that. >> Obviously not. >> You hear me? >> Your guess is your guess. And keep it to yourself. Don't even talk. Don't even tell me what you're voting. >> I would like to see you vote for something on your own without me helping at all. >> No, I will. It was America and I got it better than you. How about that? >> No. See it? There was a Georgia this outline on the sign as well. >> Does this know what Georgia is? >> What the hell was that? >> All right, game three. Surely this goes better, right? Surely this is uh this goes good. >> I'm locked in. I'm locked in. >> I'm locked. Locked. Doesn't feel like you better freaking get your together. >> Don't talk to me. Don't talk to me. >> Together. We got to win. >> Literally literally vote yourself. Oh, easy. I know this one. >> Yeah. >> Easy. >> Oh, where are we? Huh? >> I'm not going to tell you. >> Where are we at? Huh? Oh, it says on the sign actually. It says on the sign. >> Uhhuh. Yeah. >> Oh, easy. He has not guessed yet. >> So, this is Peru. We have like these tuk tuks. We have also very commonly in Peru, you have like this white brick uh painted. So, I think they're going to see Spanish and maybe guess Mexico again, but I'm going to click in the western part where it gets a little more dry. >> Oh, he guessed now. >> All right. All right. All right. >> Also, Peru is like very commonly uses tuk tucks a lot versus like other Latin American, South American countries. I think with the Spanish here, I think they could actually pretty get to Peru. >> Where do you think we are? Where do you think we are, Felix? >> I'm not going to tell you. Oh, I can move. I forgot I can move. Have you been moving? >> You can move. >> I'm locked in. >> Oh, well, I got to lock in here. >> Um, oh, we have Mexico. And then >> where are you? >> Where is Oh, he's in India. >> Jesus, what are you over there? India. Well, they have those cars. I thought they were exclusive to India. Well, I didn't know that. You said it was on the sign. Why did you tell me that? Why didn't you tell me? You said we're not talking to each other. Look, look at that. What? What is Borgund Heights Center? Don't you And this like your language? >> Oh, what the This looks like uh What is this? >> Oh, this is Norway. This is beautiful. Um, and I think Felix will know this actually because you know like Sweden, Norway, right? Like surely >> it's so slow at loading. I can't doesn't load. Can I can't read the sign? What Midag Diner? M I M I D A G. Is that a Swedish word? But it doesn't hit the center. That's some stupid Norwegian. Nor Okay. Norway. >> They could get closer here. This could be the first time they don't get too rounded. I think if he doesn't get Norway, I don't think Felix will ever hear the end of this. But he has a language here. Surely he can read that, right? >> It's stupid Norway. Stupid idiot. Splish. >> I'll pick Finland just to like get it covered. >> No, it's not Finland. Fine. Oh, now everything loaded. I knew you did. >> I told you. >> You did it. >> You got the closest. I beat him. >> He's closer. Yes. Oh my gosh. He's probably so excited. >> Stupid Norway. You're the best. I can now say I beat Rainbow One. Sorry. >> You did it. You better talk all the trash and get in there. You're the best now. >> Mar's eyeing me cuz I'm too loud. Okay, hold up. I got too excited. This could be anywhere. I have no idea. >> What in the back roads is this crap? Where's the There's this little tiny road. >> Obviously, this is European. Let me just go down the street here. The main road looks like it's France or something. So we can see here that this sign being low right here, these are all like kind of really commonly found in France. So this in France here. >> Keep walking. I Okay, I I go I go north. You go south. And then we see if we can get anywhere. >> This is like this England or something. What is this? Gil. No, this this is like German or something. I found a sign, but it's like >> What does it say? What does it say? What does it say? >> I can't read it. Like it's it's too like small. >> Yeah, it looks like it should be France or Belgium. I think it's more likely it's France. got something here. >> Oh my god, >> this flat. So you think it's Europe? Europe? >> I think so. >> I'm not sure what they end up doing here, but on 2x multi, they could potentially get pick up some points, especially if they get one really good guess cuz the further we go into multis, the higher chance they have of winning. >> I don't see anything. I'm in the fields >> in the All right. Uh with a guess there, >> I guess I go Germany cuz you said Germany. I'll go south. But you better not. Okay, that wasn't bad, actually. >> Okay, it was France, but he's closer in the Netherlands, so that's that's okay. But not too many points. >> Oh, Felix, we got close. We got close again. >> How do you not know the difference between German and French? We're closer than he was. >> Oh, we're closer. We're winning for what we got here. We have Ukraine. I'm in Ukraine. >> This is a rail, baby. Oh, it's a Russian country. What does that say? I can't read it. He already guessed. Just send instant and hope they don't have any info. Uh there's also a lake to our west. I probably should have tried to line it up, but I'm at least nude. Yeah, >> it's Russian. Okay. Okay. >> Russia is huge. >> That doesn't mean it's Russia. >> Dang. >> Isn't that a Ukraine? Is this Ukraine? >> Is it? >> Oh, they have a flag there, actually. Oh, that's actually not good. I wish they didn't have that flag there. They're going to know it's Ukraine. >> It's Ukraine. It's Ukraine. It's Ukraine. >> Okay. Okay. Okay. >> Yes, the poles have the Ukraine flag. Where? Where in Ukraine? Look at the signs. >> I'll go south somewhere. I'm in I'm in I picked the south of Ukraine. >> Okay, I'll go I go in cuz it sounds funny. >> They did see the flag. Okay. >> Damn it. You should have gone more south. Why didn't you go more south? >> What do you mean? I No, we did. We got closer. We're so close. >> We're so close, baby. >> We come on. >> They're actually playing really well. I have to play strategic here. This is Mexico. Should I just instance? I'm just going to instant hit Mexico. I can't risk it, you know. I can't risk him finding any info in 30 seconds. So, I have to walk in. >> Where are we? I don't know. I'm going up the road. He's already guessed. >> I'm going down the road then. He already guessed. >> How is he already guessed? >> He's putting How does he know? >> He's playing mind games. I'm going so fast down the road. I got to be down here. >> Hello. Where Where are we? >> There's got to be a sheep or something. >> Oh my god. He's taking advant Okay. They've been guessing Mexico a lot. So, this could be their chance where they actually need to guess Mexico. >> It's got to be Mexico, Ken. We've guessed Mexico so many times and it's not been Mexico. So, this time it's got to be Mexico. >> It's got to be All right, it was. But I didn't get time to click. It wasn't. You were right. >> Wait, PewDiePie's actually insanely Oh my gosh, that was unmute. And then they're screaming again. Let's see. Wait, what? I clicked. I almost clicked. I almost clicked. No. >> That was incredibly close, I must say. >> God dang it. >> That was the only chance we're ever going to get. We blew it. >> Oh, that was good. And you got Dude, PewDiePie, you're great north, guys. >> I'll never forgive myself. I was clicking Mexico. It didn't click. You You did click. You were just further away than you were. >> You clicked You clicked You clicked Mexico. You were just You were just further south. Yeah, >> that's even worse. Damn it. Oh man, I was nervous too because you've been clicking Mexico. >> That was a good game. >> Yeah, that was a good game. >> You should have been nervous cuz you should have heard him trash talk and he's like, ""I beat Rainbolt. I'm the greatest that's ever lived."" >> Honestly, I was believing it after a couple of those guesses. I was like, ""Oh, okay. >> What do you mean?"" Hold on, hold up. Guesses. No, no, no. We are analyzing me. I don't know what you're going on on your end. >> Oh, I'm I'm playing Geio Guesser and PewDiePie's playing Geo Nowhere. That's right. That's That's for >> exactly. Uh, >> we're lucky, man. >> Don't give him all the credit because I'll have you know that he only got closer once. All right. And I got closer twice. So, all right. Just you you recognize Felix. All right. Don't be pat him on the back. Getting carried right now. >> Yeah, but you you mix up countries. You just happen to be closer. >> So, it's it's like a it's like an idiot savant thing, you know? I'm just kind of like >> this is the most toxic game ever done. >> I'm going to get deported from Japan for being too loud. >> Marty's going to kick you out of the I want to do it eventually where I play but I only see the image for like 0.1 seconds. >> 0.1 seconds. >> Yeah. It's like flashes like a black screen. >> Like I had a seizure and I just have to guess where I was. >> Pretty much. Yeah. >> We could do we could do one more that we just did and then and then do that. >> All right. Yeah. Let's do it. Let's see. Let's do it. All right. >> Let's do one more like we did cuz I feel like you're getting nervous now cuz we almost beat you. >> Yeah. I'm not going to lie. Palms were sweaty there for a bit. All right. Good luck. That was that was a good good little couple rounds for them. Not going to lie. I think I can lose on the 0.1 seconds. This is going to be chilly. >> Well, okay. We are palm trees. Okay. All right. Yep. Yep. >> I'm just going to send it. It looks like it's near Santiago somewhere. >> What's he doing? What's he doing with that pipe? >> He's already guessed. He's got some cowboy dudes out here.

Pick pick your Mexico. Get some get some desert spot. Oh, there's a sign. My whole strategy is just guess as quick as I can to give them as little information as I can. >> Okay, I'll go I'm going way over somewhere. Not even close. Just just to get discovered. >> Okay, so I like his strategy of just guessing in Mexico every time. Where did you guess? What are you doing over there? What are you doing over there, Ken? Yo, you know, I was I was the worldwide baby. Oh my god. >> Okay, we got Sam oil happening. >> Tech. >> All right, we're in this. We're in America. >> This looks like uh Spain or France. Let me show you guys something here. You can see here that there there's no white outer line on this sign right here. And there's black or blue and white chevrons right there. That's very common in Spain. Really only in Spain, but in Europe. So, >> where's the red clay in America? >> Uh the south. >> The so flat though. Oh. Oh. Oh, no. Wait. What? What is that? Otovia. Otovia. I said America, but now it's like not. It's not. It's not. I don't know. I don't know where we are. I don't know where we are, man. I'm lost. >> Well, keep walking then. Keep walking.

Not everything is America. You stupid American. >> God damn it. >> Listen, I thought I saw the stop sign. I was like, ""Oh, yeah. I can read that. This got to be in America."" And it was over in Spain. No, >> many countries say stop, Ken. It's not just America. At least I guess something. One more. One more. One more. I need one more. >> One more.

Anti-che. >> I'm just going to take a I'm just going to take a wander down the street here. This is actually a good meta for the Philippines is if you see people playing basketball. It's actually very common in the Philippines. Filipino people love playing basketball. So, it's very common that you get that. They they're actually guessing first. Um, I'm going to guess Luzon because it looks kind of dry, but it could be something uh more south especially. But yeah, should be fine. >> There's a bunch of trash on the side. What does it say?

No more finding where they sell SIMs and then you have to remember to have the key and then not lose your original SIM. It's terrible. Whatever we used to do, those days are over. You just download SY. You can do this right now if you have a trip coming up. set up uh which country you're traveling to, how much data you want to use, and then you don't even have to think about it. Once you land, it will automatically connect to you, and you use one eim for all countries. It's super smooth, super simple. Both me and Marcia love using it. And if you enter code PewDiePie, and you just save money, 15%. You're welcome. Last thing is also with privacy. Sale is part of the Nord umbrella, which is a privacy respecting company. A lot of eim companies are not, so keep that in mind. Yeah, just thank you Sailor for being an amazing sponsor and amazing product that I genuinely love. Thank you. Check it out.

I got you on camera."" Sleep. >> He wants to sleep. >> I know. >> We got to sleep. >> Let go. >> Oh my god. >> We got a gumbot in it. We have to stay up a little longer. Beer. >> Take a photo of us. >> Take a photo of us. That's going to look so good. [Music] Swedish strawberries. [Music] >> Sakum is so pretty with pretty girls. >> Huh? >> Uh, well, I was meeting you. I met you, girl. Girl, we're staying in Sakum three days. Then we're going to my hometown which which is Goththingberg which is the best city. All my Japanese viewers feel free to come to Stockholm. Direct flights with ANA. I'm really hoping I can advertise that so that they keep having direct flights to Stockholm cuz it's very convenient for me. It's not an ad. [Music] Bren loves it. Bren saw other kids being barefoot so he just started taking off his shoes. It's kind of fun seeing Sakum as a tourist. We have a couple days to just explore. I'm always just uh meeting friends or family here, so I never get to really look around. It's crazy. Beautiful. [Music] >> To Dog. >> Yes. To >> Swedish candy bar. Oh my god. This is the best when you're a kid cuz you got 20 crowns which is like $2 and then you get to pick and then you get to put on the scale and you can see how much you got. And then you're like, ""Okay, well, maybe I want like one of those uh these."" That's like I don't know. It's It was the best. I loved it. And then you got go. Mine says favorite. You got to give it to me. [Music] >> Yay. >> That is so cute. You ready? You scared of the crocodile. Don't press it down. You can't handle it. The tension is too much. Dang. Come here. Press one. Press one. Press one, you coward. Press one. Everyone had this board game as a child in Sweden. Or at least you knew someone that had one. So much nostalgia here. I also bought the Kalanka. >> More. You want You wanted more. Sorry. [Music] We are in Gamlasan, old town of Stockholm. I remember going here as a kid, but I didn't grow up here obviously. But now I'm bringing the little guy and we're going to T to Grand which is uh the narrowest alley in Stockholm. Crazy. Wow. [Music] >> This is supposed to be like super narrow, right? But compared to Tokyo, I feel like they see this stuff everywhere, you know? [Music] Wian, so excited. >> All right, we'll see you later then. Okay, >> you want to go that way? Okay, fine. What? What are you doing? My god. >> I told Mia when I was a kid, it was like bad. I don't know if it is for other Swedish people, but it was bad luck to step on the A1's and good luck to step on the V1's. You're challenging your karma. This is not good. >> She stepped all over the A1's. You can't do both. What is wrong with you? All right. Well, you're first. Let's go. >> Good. That's the one you're supposed to do. [Music] >> You tired, Van? >> Oh, he's jet lag. I went to this place when I was a kid >> and uh I remember the dragon at the end. It's so funny. I asked about it when I entered and they were like, ""Yeah, we removed that."" Kids were traumatized. >> What? Oh my god, the memories are coming back now. I remember that. [Music] >> Hello all you children. >> Yes. >> Now we're off on a little trip to visit some other children. And Marty jumped off the roof of the wood. >> Yes, I remember. >> Oh my god. >> Oh my god. >> There's I told you about right. >> You were having a party. >> That's right. He put his sister up on the >> flight for him everywhere, even in the stream. We're flying in the >> We're flying. >> Whoa. [Music] To come to Cat. >> Wow, that's so pretty. I can't wait for the dragon here. >> Have you handsome >> reasonably's [Music] loving it, too? I can tell cuz he's not moving an inch. He was no bigger than a thumb and he lived under the floor under Betton's bed. >> Oh, the stupid mice. Yeah, they were always so evil. >> That looks so good. >> Yeah. >> Oh my god, I remember that. >> It's fun to be so small in sugar, though. >> This is way longer than I thought as well. Oh. >> Oh, this is the one. >> This was where Jonathan took his cyclical one movie I showed you. >> And jumped out of the window. >> This is when the brother died. >> There it is. >> Yes. >> No more Jonathan. >> It's okay. He comes back >> when he jumped out. >> He died. >> Poor Rusky was left. >> But he saved his brother. [Music] Oh, >> so the dragon used to come towards you. >> Oh my god. >> It doesn't move anymore. It was too scary. >> It's understandable. >> I remember that. >> The final battle. >> Then Rusky took his brother on his back and jumped over the edge >> into the lights of Nang. >> Nangalina is real. That's a use. >> That's all you need. This is really nostalgic for me. It's really fun. What a pretty day. It cleared up. >> Beautiful. >> So many boats. >> That building is insane. >> Yeah, I've been there. I think it's a museum. >> And then there's the Vasa Museum. And we have banana. So everything is good. [Music] [Music] Let's go, man. [Music] Oh, you got a >> What's he doing? That's so cute. [Music] Ah, there he is. Wait, I lost him. Where is Bern? >> Out. You I'm here. >> Yay. >> Nice flag. >> Goingberg flag. Bernal la. >> Wait. [Music] He's an angry little crab right now. Ben, >> what do we think? >> Oh, so big. >> It's huge. Goodbye crabs. >> Goodbye. >> Goodbye crab. >> We got a clear winner. I think >> he's running over now. [Applause] >> Whoa.

Bian's first midsummer. >> And let's have a look at beautiful wife again. Mag my goodness. >> Happy midsummer. >> Happy midsummer. And grumpy boy, huh? You grumpy. He had such a blast playing with his cousins yesterday. Japan is beautiful, but I think this part of Sweden, we got your beat. Ah, I smell the tar. I love it. Mom, you prepared. So everything's so nice. >> No, we don't know that until it's over. >> And you wrap it like that. And listen, >> he took the one that I made. >> He put it on on his own.

[Music] Yay. [Music] It's going to be >> Yay. [Music] Yeah. [Music] >> That's so cute. >> Yay. >> Going down for a late swim. >> So pretty here. >> Wow. What a magical day. >> Oh, [Music] >> okay. >> Last day in Sweden. Bern, how does it feel? Are you sad to go? Oh, Bern had such a good time here. He uh loved playing with his cousins and seeing them all show so much love to him. It was so nice to see. I'm so happy everyone in my family took so much effort. It was really really sweet. But now we're off to Italy for even more love from the Italian side. Bye-bye. [Music] Where's your suitcase? >> Where is your suitcase? >> You found it. Well done, [Music] Ben. What's going on here? >> You got a >> Whoa. That was cool. Whoa. Whoa. Wow. Vi, we're in Italy now. Obviously, it's very hot compared to Sweden, but it's very pretty and we're having a great time. B is having a great time hanging out with this non. They have turtles in their garden. Do you see them here? Yes, I see them. And then there's one there. >> There's one. >> Wow. [Music] My hair is crazy. Johnny Bravo. We're in the mountains. It's really nice. Like 10Â° colder. This is where they get the water from. All the different mountain tops here. The lift is closed. I think it's been closed for quite a while. Very comfortable up here. Look at this beautiful horses. It's electric fence here. I can't go too close. Here you go, donkey. [Applause] [Music] Apparently Matia's dad worked on the steel that for the cable way and all the fences and he's been working steel work for 50 years. It's really cool to see cuz whenever we drive around he's like I worked on that. I worked on that. We're stopping for lunch now. This is our table. >> You look good. D. >> Beautiful mushroom yaki. [Music] This playground is amazing. So pretty. You want to go here? You want to go on the bridge? There's like black swans over there. Hydrrenas. So so pretty here. Whoa. Wow. Chow chow. >> Den, are you scared of the animals? They're a little scared. Oh, you're a little sleepy. That's why. [Music] You got >> good. So cute. Oh, >> yeah. Let's go. >> Really? Yes, of course. She's unstoppable, even on vacation. [Music] I went on a bike ride with Bern. He really wanted to go on a bike ride. Oh, you screamed at everyone. Yeah, now you're happy. He's happy on a bike now. I feel like we are uh Dian's having a really good time with the all these different families that he has abroad and it's really nice. The weather is nice. It's very hot. We're going to have delicious lunch. Yeah. Just a simple relaxing vacation. >> Really? You want to keep going then? >> It's not too high. [Music] [Laughter] >> No. Yeah. [Music] The chicken crossed the road. [Music] He's not behind here. That's crazy. Where is be? I caught you. >> That was a good hiding. Take me. >> Okay. Okay. I don't see him anymore. >> Hello. So, our two week journey Sweden, Italy ends. We're going back to Japan. Feels really nice. We had an amazing trip as always. It's so amazing for Bern to have so much culture in this life with Italy and Sweden. I think it's so great. Not to mention Japan on top of it. But yeah, looking forward to go home and see the dogs. >> Please. [Music] I need to get real for a second. I have promoted NordVPN for years now and not being super techsavvy. I've just kind of trusted the pros with the VPN is good. You should use it. Uh but lately I'm becoming more techsavvy and I'm learning more about Linux and this kind of stuff. And I finally uh realize and I finally understand you should always use NordVPN to protect yourself online. It still stands. With NordVPN, you unlock the entire internet at your disposal. It does so while keeping you safe. In your private Wi-Fi, your ISP knows exactly what you're doing. I don't think they should be doing that. And if you connect to public Wi-Fi, it could have serious detrimental effects without a VPN. It encrypts you. No one knows what you're doing but you as it should be. Nord also comes with a threat protection which is another amazing level of security protecting you from malware, fishing attacks, outaware attacks. All this baked in into a great deal. I tried freeVPNs. They're completely useless. With Nord, you can run it and you won't even tell a difference. It's that fast. So, check out nordvpn.com/piepie. You get four months for free. You can try it out for 30 days. It's the best deal you could possibly get. Thank you, NordVPN, for being an amazing sponsor. It sort of all came full circle, didn't it? That's nordvpn.com/piepie. Thank you.",unknown
u_Lxkt50xOg,"Maybe you're wondering why is it wearing that cool hat. It's cuz the tech overlords are listening. Now I can finally say Google smoole. What are you going to do Google? You're completely powerless now. What's that? Google owns YouTube. I would Google that, but I literally can't. What are they going to do? Censor this video? Demonetize it? Bury it under the algorithm so no one can find it? You're completely powerless. Google, you got nothing on me. So, the past couple weeks, I've completely deooled. I don't use any of Google's so-called free services except YouTube. I literally can't escape. It's surprisingly hot to wear a tinfoil hat. I don't know if you guys knew this. Well, you never worn a tinfoil hat before. Now, this all started because of privacy concerns. Being tracked with it, literally everything I do just feels kind of odd. mainly cuz I wanted to also regain control over my software and not to be at mercy of what the tech overlords decide to do just one day. But most importantly, I don't want to pay 20 bucks a year for 100 GB storage. Not happening. I realized since swapping to Linux, my life has just been going upwards. I'm practically ascending next step. But I realized there's always an open-source alternative and a lot of times they're better. They just don't have a billion dollar budget to market themselves. So, I went down the dele rabbit hole and I want to share what I learned because by the end of this once you know what I know, bro, you're going to want one of these cool hats as well. So, let's go through the delegalization. I want to be honest and share what I think you should absolutely change and maybe what was more hassle than worth. Number one, your search engine. Change your search engine right now. You can do it now while I keep yapping. Just go to your browser settings, find the search default browser, and change it to doc.go. It's a search engine that doesn't track what you do. It just works. Boom. Maybe you prefer everything you do online to be tracked and logged. I don't know. Maybe you're in that ballpark. I think just most people are either oblivious or lazy. So, I'm telling you now, don't be lazy. Number two, your browsing. When I told you to change your default search engine, you did not just do that inside of Google Chrome, did you? Say you ain't think so. There are way better browsers out there. I use Firefox. It's kind of B tier, but you can lock it down into S tier. A lot of people swear by Brave browser. I never tried it. My point is this is super easy to change. And have you ever thought why browsers are free to begin with? Why is Microsoft so why do they want you to use their browser so goddamn badly? You know, why do they all make it free for you? Could it be cuz they track everything you do online and sell or trade your data? What? What do you mean they don't make this out of the goodness in their heart? You're telling me Google isn't just a trillion dollar charity? What? I found online that in 2023, Google paid Apple to be their default search browser in Safari. Guess how much? 20 billion. Jesus Christ. They definitely want you to use Google. So, just don't. It will take you 2 minutes. Go do it. Number three, the third thing I changed. Like many of you, I've been using Google Mayor for years and years and years. And apparently up until 2017, that's when they stopped scanning your emails to serve you ads. So now Gmail is a little less creepy, you know, but uh if you think about it, it is probably the most invasive service that they run. Like and there are free alternatives out there like Proton. I haven't tried it out. I decided to send this and get my own email. I paid a small fee. It was fiddly as hell, but at least people won't think I'm poor and have like Google Schmoogle in my ad domain. Number four, with me deing lately, I realized it's time for me to d something else. D's I don't want to say the joke. Anyway, I started working with G-Fuel 6 years ago. GFuel sponsor. [Music] We created the greatest flavor of all time. GFuel Lingberry. Lingon Berry is out and it's really, really good. Honestly, I'm so proud of this flavor. Yuzu slash legendary moment. Yuzu Slash Baby, Sour Green, PewDiePie. So many great memories, so many great slurps, so many great memes. But it's finally time to retire this guy, Sayanara Jusa, cuz we're introducing a new tub and t-shirt. [Music] Same energy, new armor. Get the collector's box. You get the t-shirt and the new tub. You don't want to be tubless this summer. I tell you that much. That's worse than having Google in your sub domain. It's available right now. Check it out. Link in the description. Finally. Don't miss this opportunity to be part of history. We got many more exciting G-Fuel announcement coming up. So stay tuned. Number five, your phone. I have a Google phone. God damn it. Everything is Google. It's crazy. I didn't realize how deep I've been swept into this ecosystem without realizing it. My goddamn TV is Google. I thought it was a Sony TV. You open up, it's like Google TV. How did that happen? I don't know about you, but I feel like I'm supposed to be enamored by the phone, how amazing it is with it incredible hardware and how powerful it is. But if it's so great, then why do I feel like I'm the product? Huh? I hate my phone. notifications just feel like they're there to suck me in, not to tell me anything useful. All these apps and features. I feel like my uh attention span is just getting mushed the more I use my phone. I hate it. It's just one big giant distraction device. So, I have a Pixel 9 and it is a good phone and I already own it. So, instead of switching it out to like a dumb phone or something like that that I know a lot of people do, I want to install a custom OS on it. There was a lot of them to choose from, but I opted for Graphine. Graphine mainly because it felt like the biggest point the finger to Google. You know, it's an operating system focused on privacy and security apparently. So much so that even Edward Coen uses it. Did I get that right? I would Google it, but I can't. But here's the thing, okay? For some reason, I feel like I'm the crazy one. Huh? What? Why do you want to Google so bad? Huh? Where do you got to hide? Huh? This guy got graffine on his phone. What What's up with that? I feel a little judged. Okay. But after using graffine, I realize, no, this is how it should be. I'm not the crazy one. There's a few features on Graffine that I really like, and these are just to name a few. Especially with security, I really like how they amped it up. But the fact that I close an app on Graffine and it closes the app. Crazy. A lot of times on your phone if you think you've closed an app but in reality running in the background and still tracking whatever it is they want to graphine nuke that [Â __Â ] is gone. Such a crazy concept right? I'm the crazy one. Number two I control exactly what the app has access to. You can use file or storage scopes I think it's called. And if I want to give an app access to a certain type of files I pick which folder? Not the entire device as it should be. Not some vague little popup going like, ""Hey, do you want to you want to give them access to this?"" No. Complete control. Number three, whenever you install an app on Graphine, it asks you before installing it, ""Hey, do you want to give this app access to your internet?"" Cuz a lot of times the answer is heck no. Not happening. I realized I was trying desperately to find a keyboard that has Japanese, Swedish, and English. I really like the Swift kind of typing, you know? I just couldn't find an open source alternative and I was like, what do I do? And then I realized the alternative is Microsoft or Google. Okay. And I realized the keyboard that they offer is connected to the internet. Why? Why? Imagine you bought a physical keyboard and it was secretly connected to the internet sending big tech everything you type. We're not doing anything weird. Just trust us, bro. It's so messed up. On graffiti, I still have the option. And if I want to take a Google app, I can starve it. Put it in one of those. I still don't like that I use a Google app, but uh no, actually it's good. Google is at my mercy for once. Feels good. Another feature that I think is kind of obvious and most people would appreciate. But there was a fourth hidden feature on graphine that I love that it is not a feature, but for me it ended up being one. Like I talked about in the beginning, it feels a lot of times when I use a phone, it's such a distraction. There are some some apps that you probably have to use. Maybe it's for work or because of friends and you want to connect, whatever. You're going to have to use certain apps that you don't really want to use. So, I decided to put all those apps and you can do this as well actually on a different profile. The good thing about Graphine is that on a different profile, all these apps are contained in that profile. They can't connect to anything else on my phone or run in the background or anything like that. That's what great about Graphine and that's why to me it felt like a good solution with all the apps that I don't want to use. But what this ended up doing was that, okay, now I need to use this app that I don't like to use. It feels intentional going there. I don't even see these apps when I use my phone on a regular basis. And it made so that my phone starts feeling like it's serving me again, like an actual useful tool that it supposedly is, right? So yeah, huge fan. I'm so glad I swapped out. It's probably the best thing I did so far, but it gets better. Okay, I had to ride this couple weeks. I tell you what number is it six or five? I I don't [Â __Â ] I lost count. Uh anyway, password managers. What do you mean password one two three isn't going to cut it? I hate password managers. Why? Because they cost 6 to7 to host a 5 kilobyte size document. I don't think so. This whole video is me just doxing myself for being cheap. It's not happening. I'm not paying that. I almost had a heart attack when I found out. I'm paying what? But you need a password manager. That's just the reality of today. I thought I was so smart. I was like, ""Okay, fine. I don't need to do these. I'm running Linux."" I downloaded a backup. I made it into an HTML and then I encrypted it and then I had an alias. So, I unencrypted when I need to use it and then quickly encrypt it. Is it Is it unencrypt or decrypt? It doesn't matter. Bada bing, bada boom. I saved myself 67. If I live for, I don't know, 30, 40, 50 years. That's like I saved myself a lot of money. Multi-millionaire is a cheap assmp. That's what I should call this. But then I realized I need this file on other devices. I need it on my phone and my laptop. And what if I go abroad? And that's when I discovered Glorious SH self-hosting. I can just host this on another device. I feel like ever since I did my Linux video, so many comments have been like, just wait until it discovers self-hosting. it's going to be game over. And yet, you were right. Okay. What? I started off on a Raspberry Pi 5. This thing is relatively cheap. It's got Ethernet. It runs on low power and it's powerful for its size. Can do more than enough for what I wanted to do. I found an open- source uh alternative, which is Volta Warden. You can host your own password manager. Basically, the problem was I have no clue what the heck I'm doing. What is a reverse proxy? What do you mean I can't just put my IP address in my browser and be done with it? Volt Warden is so secure that it wouldn't let me connect to it unless I set it up properly. Every time I thought I did it, I kept seeing the spinny circle and I saw that circle for two goddamn days. But once it finally worked, magic. I have done it. I had saved myself 67. Tears running down my eyes. It was beautiful. My first successful selfhost. My god. No more subscriptions, no more sinking drama, just my own secure vault. It felt like I was finally breaking out of the matrix for real. And the thing is, once you start understanding how this works, it's really not that bad. If anything, it became super fun because with compatibility layers like Docker, you can so easily just pick and choose what open source software you want to download, keep trying out different ones. The world is your oysters. Just pluck them from the trees and everything just works. So, I needed a note takingaking app. I found one called Yaplin. That's how you say that, Yaplan. It had a desktop app and a phone app, which is exactly what I wanted. But when I installed Yoplin, this is where things got weird. Do not judge me here, okay? This is, you can probably relate to this actually. Have you ever been so lazy that you try and find another alternative, but then that leads you on a road that was 10 times more complicated than just not being lazy? The image that I was trying to install on my Pi was not compatible. It was 86x 64. This is ARMbased structure. It doesn't matter. Not compatible. I can just find another one. But I thought, hey, why don't I just quickly install this on something that does run 86x 64. And I look around and I'm like, oh well well, well, my Steam Deck runs 86x 64. So, you may be asking, ""Helix, did you use your portable handheld gaming console to host your note-taking app?"" Yes, but it get it gets worse, actually. Steam runs Linux. Beautiful. It actually runs Arch, which is the dro I use on my desktop. Match made in heaven. But, uh, I thought to myself, well, it's filled with all this like steam bloat. I should probably uninstall Arch so I can then install Arch. I don't know what's wrong with me. Don't ask. And I did this, of course, just so I wouldn't have to. Uh, find another image of my note takingaking app. But anyway, it works. At the end of the day, that's all that matters. Now I got my notes app running beautifully. Number seven or eight. It was time to say goodbye Google Drive. Goodbye, Jotto. 20 bucks for 100 gig? I don't think so. I'm not going to pay you to hold my data hostage forever. Not happening. What if I live for another 600 years? Think about how much money that's going to be to Google. No more subscriptions. Redundant subscriptions. Instead of Google Drive, I set up File Browser. The thing that bothers me about all these free online stoages that gives you a certain amount at least is that first of all, it's not safe. Second of all, I don't know what they're doing with that. Thirdly, I hate how it's used. I don't know if you can relate to this. Maybe this is like a me problem, but let's say I'm out. I've gone outside, I've touched grass, I've taken all these photos and videos, and then I sit down in front of my computer, and then all of a sudden, internet goes down, and I'm like, what happened? And then it's like, oh yeah, my Google Drive decided to back up every single photo and video I've ever taken, and it's like, I don't want that. I want certain images. Let me pick those first. And I don't want you to suck up my entire bandwidth. With file browser, I can throttle the speed and I can do it when I want to, which files I want to. I went a little nerdy and overboard surprise. And I wrote a bunch of aliases and shell functions so that I can define push or pull to download or upload which device, my phone, laptop, desktop, deck, and which subfolder. And I do all this with glorious SSH. It actually solved another problem for me, which is always sharing files between my phone and my desktop. I never know how to do it. Apparently, I didn't know this. I feel like everyone is tuning out because I'm talking about SSH again, but you can run it on your phone. Look, I'm connected. And then I thought, and now I gotta do an opposite script on my phone. But then I realized I can just connect to my desktop to run the script. It doesn't matter. Okay, it's cool. Just trust me, it's cool. Number nine, AI. We have to talk about AI. I don't know about you, but I don't like using AI. It feels like I'm kneeling directly to the tech overlords. And not to mention the goddamn subscription fees. I feel like I'm spoon feeding the machine that has stolen all my data. More of my data. Here you go. Nice and fat. Here you go. Not happening. But I got curious and you know I built my own computer not long ago and I spent a lot of money on it. Why don't I just see if I can run it myself? It's a beast. So I set up a local language model called Mixstro. Emphasis on local which means it runs on my computer completely offline. It's beautiful. Now I can search whatever I want and I can ask it dumb questions like why is my left toe bigger than my right toe and no one knows about it. Not Google, not AI overlords, not even you. Step 10. How many steps are there? And we have so much left. PDFs, Google Docs, calendar, contacts. I was honestly getting a little tired at this point to try and find an alternative to all of these, but that's when I discovered NexCloud. It's an open source self-host beast, and it does all of this for you. Maybe there are better singular alternatives, but the fact that I can get all of this baked in one was exactly what I needed. And just one quick install and it was done. I was completely out of Google and it felt amazing. Finally, I'm free. From here on on is when I needed to tighten things up a little bit. I actually bought a domain. I know I paid a subscription fee, but it's worth it. If you're self-hosting, it's actually worth it cuz you can get a domain for five bucks a year. It means I can get better security features and I can put all these services in subdomains. So like docs.mmysubdomain.com and password.mmysubdomain.com like all all these different things I made I can access easily. I don't have to type my IP address for each one. And I started to tighten down the security as well. Especially cuz I was looking online. I'm like, I'm getting a lot of bots that are pinging me. I don't like this. Everything is locked in with the password already, but I added another layer of zero trust, so you can't access anything. Uh, unless you have another login. I locked in my IP address with tail scale. Beautiful tail scale. I could make a whole video. I had a failure ban. It was definitely worth spending some time locking things down. And I think I found a good balance of it being secure, but also not like a huge hassle every time you want to access either. Now, swapping out all these Google services, there's one that I just can't escape, and I don't mean YouTube. There's one that sucked the most to get rid of, and there was actually Google Maps because Google tracks you so well. It is so good at predicting traffic. And since I drive a lot in Tokyo, I really rely on that to get on to places on time. You can't be late in Japan. It's like a death sense. The first time I used my open source alternative, I ended up 30 minutes late. And that's when I realized, hey, maybe big brother tracking everything isn't so so bad. Maybe surveillance has its perks. But I stuck to my deing and I the best alternative I found was just using my car's GPS. It's a it has all this Japanese services built in. Anyway, I ended up using my Pi to replace my Google TV and I'm running Kodi on that. I haven't really fully set it up yet, so not much to say about it. And you may remember I'm doing all of this on my Steam Deck. I added an extension so I can plug it into Ethernet. That way it runs on less power. It runs completely headless and I can monitor all of it on my safe network system that I have. But then I thought it'd be kind of cool to use the display so I can use that for monitoring. I ran T-Max and Btop on it and it looks so cool. You know, this all started because I wanted to de Google and try what that what that was like. And by the end of it, my Steam Deck looks like it's a detonator for a bomb or something like that. And before you ask, yes, I can still game on it. All right, it runs 2% of my CPU. It's like this weird home lab abomination at this point. But I love it. I love looking at it. I got it sitting next on my desk. It's just a vibe, man. Every time I see it, I'm happy. Another fact that I like using my Steam Deck is the fact that I can just use whatever I have around me. People have these like super sick home lab setups, which are awesome. I get it. But I my point with this is that if you wanted to de Google, you can use whatever you have at your disposal. It shouldn't cost you any extra money. Like I'm not going to pretend that Steam Deck is the ultimate self-host device. You're probably better off using a Pi, but maybe you have some device laying around at home that you can run Linux on. Bring it back to life, you know, instead of throwing it away. And I hate to be that guy, but it's better for the environment. Yes, it's a lot of tinkering, but you learn a lot. And by the end of it, it's done. Like, I don't have to touch it. Google's mantra is don't be evil, but I still think they have a lot to do to qualify for that title. I feel like on your phone you have all these settings with privacy and give permissions and all these things that they ask you, but it kind of feels like one of those toys that Bern has that it's just like a bunch of buttons that doesn't actually do anything. Unless you go all the way with privacy, it doesn't mean anything. Don't call it privacy. And for me, it's not even necessarily about Google. I think it's more about big tech in general. I hate where software is going. Unnecessary subscriptions, ads, locking, updates being changing the entire UI because you're more prone somehow to give get more locked in. With YouTube, you know, it's been constantly changing for years and years and years just because they figured this is the best way to suck you in. If I host my own apps, there's none of that. So now I got my own home lab abomination and I love it. I'm finally free from the tech overlords. It was 100% worth it. And look, bro, I made you one, too. You've earned it. Here you go, bro. [Music] This video is sponsored by SY. I am a huge fan of SY cuz it genuinely makes traveling for us so much easier. This time when we were on our way to Savannah, Marcy asked me about it and we literally set it up on the flight because it had internet. For those you don't know, SY is an eim app, which means electronic SIM. So if you're traveling almost anywhere in the world, over 60 countries, you get access to internet through this app. M said just open the app, pick the country, picked how much data she needed, and of course use code PewDiePie, which gave her a 15% discount, and bada bing bada boom, instant internet as soon as you land, which is what I want. The first thing I want when I land is internet. I genuinely hate I hate standing in line when I land renting a Wi-Fi box. How is that a good solution? You just have to carry another thing when you're traveling that also have to worry about being charged. Or if you opt to just buy a physical SIM while you're there, you still have to go and actually find where to buy it, set it all up while you're there, and you have to worry about losing your original SIM. At least I do. It's kind of important. I don't like removing it. SY just solves all the problems. It's an amazing service and I highly recommend it. You can use the QR code to download it or use the code PewDiePie at checkout for 15% discount. If you're planning a trip anywhere, you can download it right away, set it up all now, and don't even have to think about it. You need internet when you travel. So, I just love that it removes that stressful element to me. So, thank you Sy for being an amazing sponsor and you guys are welcome.",unknown
4uqo-brP3xs,"Hey Ben, [Music] [Music] we just spent 2 hours in traffic cuz we were going to the beach. Had everything packed. I was ready to surf, but it was just madness. Too much traffic. So, we're going to this park now. We also waited in traffic to go to, but less traffic. This might be good. [Music] Mama made such pretty bento. I can't wait to eat it. Yeah. Look at this homemade pkatcha. [Music] Wow. Wow. It's a moon. It's a star, actually. But that was close. Oh, a tree. A bird. Yes, a bird. You saw that? It was a bird. It's a bird. Yes. Wow. What an amazing entrance. I didn't expect it. He's interested in the water. Look at giraffe beard. Wow. [Music] Thank you. They have they love to bathe, huh? Hello, monkey. [Laughter] That was really cute. Not what we had planned, but you know. What do you smell? Yes, it smells nice. It's flowers. Japan has a really nice smell now. Unless you smell those certain trees that you may know about. [Music] Damn. Okay, don't waste water. Look at these beautiful meals your mama prepares for you. Be goes for the strawberries first. Good choice. Was it good? Was it good? You're making weird faces. Hello. Hello. Perfect. Well done, my assistant. [Music] Wow. Whoa. And this one. Perfect. Well done. Let's put it in place.

I need to get real for a second. I have promoted NordVPN for years now. And not being super techsavvy, I've just kind of trusted the pros with the VPN is good. You should use it. Uh, but lately I'm becoming more techsavvy and I'm learning more about Linux and this kind of stuff. And I finally uh realize and I finally understand you should always use NordVPN to protect yourself online. It still stands. With NordVPN, you unlock the entire internet at your disposal. It does so while keeping you safe in your private Wi-Fi. Your ISP knows exactly what you're doing. I don't think they should be doing that. And if you connect to a public Wi-Fi, it could have serious detrimental effects without a VPN. It encrypts you. No one knows what you're doing but you as it should be. Nord also comes with a threat protection which is another amazing level of security protecting you from malware, fishing attacks, outaware attacks. All this baked in into a great deal. I tried freeVPNs. They're completely useless. With Nord, you can run it and you won't even tell a difference. It's that fast. So, check out nordvpn.com/piepie. You get four month for free. You can try it out for 30 days. It's the best deal you could possibly get. Thank you nvpn for being an amazing sponsor. It sort of all came full circle, didn't it? That's nordvpn.com/piepie. Thank you. [Music] What are you doing, Dan? We're heading to Jimbo. It's like the book place in Tokyo. We You probably seen it. We just never went. Uh should be cool to check out.

That was so good. Can you say mama? Mama. Marca's driving my car for the first time. I'm passing your princess today. First time Marcia drives my car ever in Japan. Doing great. Really proud of you. We figured uh Bern always wants Mars as a headshot. So if she drives, he understands. We found a loophole. It worked. He's asleep. So we're going uh on a big road trip, actually. uh 5 days, 6 days uh to west of Japan. Really excited. We never really traveled that far with a car before. So, we have everyone in the car. Momo, Mugi, Mi. Oh my. Our first stop is Link Link Sua. [Music] We're in the countryside of Japan. It's very, very pretty. Our first stop is coming up in 20 minutes. How are we doing back there? [Music] All right, 4-hour journey. We made it to Lake Sua. Super pretty. Nice and hot. Yes, there's stuff over there. I love whenever you get out of Tokyo. Yes, those are bikes.

Yes. I love traveling with the dogs even though it's crazy. You're just crazy. And you guys like it too, huh? I couldn't find a park, so we're at a park in line. I asked locals. They were like, ""There's some greasy yakitori cooking up here."" I'll tell you that much. People are so friendly once you get out of Tokyo. I've spoken to six people so far. It's crazy. In Tokyo, people I think are still very nice, but they don't stop to talk to you the same way as in other places. Well, here we are. Got these new pants. And my wife got me these pants. What do you guys think? You got my pop. Have you seen my Pat? Oh, what a day. We got four dogs here. That's crazy. What are we doing? Four dogs and a boy. Not bad, isn't it?

pgeTa1PV_40,"How's it going, bros? My name is PewDiePie. Check it out. New camera. What do you guys think? Pristine. This is actually, if you can believe it. This was filmed with my camera. I made this camera. All right. Honestly, which one is better? Now, now my camera quality actually looks good if I compare it to this. Anyway, I want to tell you guys how I how this all came to be. You may be wondering why I'm in my car. You see, it all started with me selling my old car, my Tesla, and I had dog mode on it, which I find really helpful. What the dog doing? Dog mode is not as fun as it sounds. Literally just a temperature control sensor. And my new car, I don't mean to flex, but it's a minivan. Mitsubishi Delica. And uh, no, it does not have dog mode. I actually found it really helpful. Like if I need to just pop in a shop really quick or if me and Mars are traveling with the dogs, we maybe want to stop for a bite. So I thought, screw it. I'll do something better. I'll add a camera in here cuz the Tesla didn't have that. I can check the temperature and the humidity and that way at least I know my dogs aren't getting scorched to death while I'm away for a minute. So, I picked up a camera online with a humidity and temperature sensor and I was setting it up here and uh I realized all of a sudden sweat was just pouring from my face. My forehead was pulsing. I was getting angry. Why does the camera charge me monthly to use it features? My neighbor walked past. Why does a humidity sensor want my private information? That's when I had the brilliant idea. Right then and then I was going to build my own camera. This Dumbo thought that was a good idea. To make all of this happen, I decided to use a Raspberry Pi. You probably heard of these already. It's a single board computer. And the best part, it runs Linux. Yes. And that's when I discovered glorious SSH. SSH, which stand for secure shell protocol. SSH is basically a way to connect to your uh computer remotely. The fact that you can communicate with a computer just with your keyboard. I feel like I'm a wizard. I'm typing spells with commands. I love it. I type. There are other things you can use but a Pi, but since it's such a tiny computer, it's got GPIO pins, which means you can add a bunch of different hardware to it. And it's got a slot for camera to go to. Perfect. To set this up is super simple. You just have an SD card. You put it in your computer. You use Raspberry Pi software to flash it and you're done. Now, for some reason, and this is not Linux fault. It's not the fault that I'm on Linux. The program didn't work. I think I needed root access and it just wouldn't give it to me. It's not Linux fault. Actually, it's actually good that I'm on Linux because I can solve this problem easily. I just have to do it manually. LSBLK mount that drive and then just flash it on my own. What can go wrong? Flashing an uh a drive on Linux is a bit like a nuclear launch without the glass cover. One wrong move and you can kiss your disc bye-bye. Don't ask me how I know. So yeah, finally I'm in. I'm connected. I'm ready to set this thing up. You may notice it's called car 17. Don't ask me why it's called car 17. At this point, I didn't want to complicate things. All right? So, I thought, okay, a Raspberry Pi and an official Raspberry Pi camera. I plug them in. It should just work. And it does. There's a program called Lib Camera. It works great for photos. It works great for recording video and video streaming. However, should work. It should work. It should work. Now, I don't know how to code. I'm a noob and I realized I'm way over my head here. Okay, so I used a program called Raspby and Raspby Cam was beautiful. Man, it worked perfectly. We had a such a good thing going. Me and Raspby Cam. Can you imagine one day waking up and your best friend is just gone? One reboot and Raspby Cam was just poof. I didn't even get to say goodbye. I don't know what happened. I don't want to use Lib Cam. Goddamn lip cam. I looked everywhere online and everyone's like, ""Oh yeah, use recipe cam. It works great. Look."" And I'm like, ""Yeah, it just doesn't."" I look at all these tutorials and man I I feel like I'm being gaslit. Until I finally reading the forums, I find out that Raspby Cam has been deprecated since 2021. RIP. A lot of trial and error and I finally finally got it working. This felt like a huge win. Sheer stubbornness made this happen. But I finally had my streaming live feed. That's what I needed. Huge win. I then added the DHT sensor, which is uh measures temperature and humidity. I added a battery. I 3D printed a case. Bada bing, bada boom. And poof, my dog spy cam was complete. Look at this thing. It's adorable. I love it. I showed it in my last video and like no one cared. I was like, ""Look, I made this camera."" Hint hint. Do you want me to talk more about it? Anyway, I think it's cool. Me and Marissa went on a road trip. I got to test out the camera. When me and Marissa stopped to have a bite, we could check that the dogs were sound and safe and comfortable and no stress involved. I love it. I want to do so much more with this because I know I it's possible, right? I thought it'd be so good if I can have like notifications. So, if it hit certain temperatures and humidity, maybe high or too low, it would notify me on my phone somehow. I don't know. Okay, fine. I don't know how to do this and the quality sucks and I get it. Like it's not as good as an actual camera, but it's my camera, okay? And I can do whatever I want. It is such a difference from buying this camera that you have to pay to use. It's crazy. It's not the best camera, but it's my camera. Sorry to interrupt the video. I'm hiding in the wilderness to tell you about today's sponsor, Incogn. Thousands of companies are collecting your private data. They got stuff like your full name, address, phone number. They even got stuff on your relatives. Leave the relatives out of it. They do all this without you agreeing to it. At least I didn't agree to it. Why they do? Because they make money of your data. That's my data. That's my money. If you're getting spam calls, that's a dead giveaway that your data has been compromised. for example. Now, the good news is you can opt out of this. You have the legal right to. The bad news, it will take you likely years and a lot of time that you maybe want to spend doing other things. That's where Incogn comes in. They go John Wick on these bastards. They do it all for you and you can just watch it all happen while you sit back and relax. If you go to incogn.com/piepie, you get 60% off. That's a great deal. That's practically a steal. And they have a cool new feature where if you have family unlimited plan, you can point to anywhere online where your private data is and that you want removed and they'll do that for you. Seriously amazing. I saw no one who's trying to do that before and just be like, ah, it's too difficult. It's too time consuming and it costs too much money. This is a great deal. So check out incognit.com/piepie. Get 60% off. Thank you for sponsoring this video. Now I got to find my way out of here. Now, project number two. That's right. While I was tinkering and sminkering, I got a little bored at at a point certain point with this. So, I had started on another project because I went through such hell to get the first one going. I was like, well, the second one is going to be easier. I already know all this stuff now. It's it's going to be a breeze. I wanted to build a nightstand clock. I have an Alexa right now. It's fine, but it really annoys me because it always asks me to update it. It logs me out every time it reboots. Why do I have to log in to begin with? And I don't know how I feel about having Jeff Bezos staring at me while I'm sleeping. Okay, so with Product 2, I wanted to replace that Alexa and built my own sort of nightstand device. And this time it was going to be easy. Okay, I already went through all the issues with the camera. Nothing can go wrong. And to be fair, it it went easy in the beginning. I actually got the speaker for this working on the first try. I couldn't believe it. Holy. Front, left, front. It worked on the first try. That has never happened. What? It worked so great until it didn't, of course. All right, here we go. Lasagna. Why does everyone I love leave me? A little side note here. I don't know if you guys have noticed this, but anytime tech reviewers on YouTube when they review a tiny speaker, they all do this, and I don't understand why. They go, ""Oh, it doesn't sound bad at all for its size."" If it's tiny, it's bad by default. Okay, listen, my brethren. My brother, tiny isn't good. We have to accept this. Physics is physics, brother. Come here. It's okay. Anyway, my speaker, however, super bad. I really wish I got a better speaker. It's literally made out of paper. But I know a secret trick that the all these tech reviewers don't know about. If you cut the ground wire while it's playing, it sounds amazing. [Music] Felix lawyer here. Do not cut the ground wire. Man, my speaker did all kinds of weird stuff. It made it funny at least. I wanted to set up Spotify on this so I can stream music on it, even though the speaker is terrible. And it was super easy. You just install the package. Bada bing, bada boom. With this project, most of the time I had to spend on was actually 3D printing because I wanted to try and make this look nice. At least I was inspired by old handheld radios. I wanted to have like this handheld feel to it, even though it it's not a handheld device, but most of the time I spent 3D printing. And here's me uh breaking my filament sensor while trying to clear some clawed [Music] filament. That's not good. Come on. Come on. I didn't know it at the time. Anytime I try to print, the filament kept going, ""No, you can't print. There's something stuck in there."" And I go, ""Oh, is it?"" Because I just cleaned it. I know for a fact there's nothing stuck in there. I kept getting gaslit by my 3D print there. I know there's nothing in there. I actually try to look up if I can SSH into my printer. And you can if you hack it. I was this close to doing it cuz I was like, ""Well, I just needed to shut up and print. Like, it's not an issue."" and if I can just like find the function to remove the filament sensor. But then I was like, you know what? Maybe I'll just buy a filament sensor and replace it. Maybe I don't have to fight every bat. I found this screen. It's really cheap and I don't know, but I like it and it looks really nice. I just wanted to test out the screen and I found this script that has blinking eyes and mine just said it was really cute, so obviously I had to keep it. It made it kind of like a beimo vibe I feel like. So I kind of went with that. So things were looking pretty good, but then cable madness. I had so many different hardware ran into this thing at this point and cables kept falling off everywhere. I kept resoldering them so they would stick, but it just kept happening and I kept going, ""This is not human. This whole video is just me complaining about troubleshooting. Someone needs to know my pain."" I kept going, ""This is not human."" It's not human. I need to save space. I have to solder them all. This is not human. But then that's when I found glorious sha. I'm just kidding. I found glorious hot glue. That's right. Instant stability. And I'm talking about my mental health. It worked like a charm. It's small. There's small stuff like that that uh yeah, it makes a big difference. But at this point, I was so done. And I showed it to Marcia and she uh rightfully reminded me, where's the microphone you wanted to use? Okay. turn lights on thing, right? The voice command. And I'm like, please, there's so many cables that I don't want to I don't want more. And here's the thing, right? Uh with GPIOs, it's not like it's plug-andplay. You still have to activate it and find the right package for it. And microphone, especially I2C, is really difficult. At least I found that it was. And I realize they have USB ports. It's okay to use the USB ports. I don't have to fight every battle, man. That meant it. It was pretty much plug-andplay with a microphone. And I'm actually really glad Ma pushed me to do this cuz I found this open- source software called Vosque. Super cool. It runs voice transcription locally, so it's completely offline. Chikita banana. Oh, banana. Oh, can you come here? Try. Can you say airplane? Really? That was so good. The another reason I didn't want to use the microphone because I thought I would have to use some sort of Amazon or Google API. I I don't know. The whole point was kind of to avoid that. So yeah, the way I ran it, you know, it's not perfect. You know, this is as good as I got, but it works. I found again open source for my plug so you can turn the lights on and it works. Lights on. Oh, first try. Lights off. The project is done. Bye, Alexa. Alexa, kill yourself. No, I'm just kidding. I was worried the light was going to be a little too uh strong, but it's actually quite a comfortable color. I'm very happy with it. I think it looks neat. Again, a great learning experience. Now, I've been going on for 2 months with these projects on and off, and I had one more idea that I really wanted to do, and I felt like I was kind of cheating myself if I didn't do it. It's a little hard to explain, but hear me out, okay? This idea started because the weather in Tokyo at least is a bit unpredictable. And Marcy always asks me before going out in order to know what to wear, she's like, ""What? How do you know how hot it And I'm like, ""Oh, it says 20Â°, but it says it feels like 28."" And it says later it might rain, so maybe bring a jacket or an umbrella or maybe not. I don't know. Not helpful. So, I thought, what if instead of deciphering all these data, what if you just looked at a screen and then there's an avatar that is dressed for the weather and you just match what the avatar is wearing? You don't even have to think about it. Genius. I was curious if anyone's ever done this. And yes, there are like apps that do it. But then I ruined the idea completely because I got another idea. Okay, this happened because I was going to use an e- in display. E- in displays are amazing. They run on super low power. They have this sort of pixelated retro field to them, which I really like, but I ordered this one and it was way smaller than I thought. I was like, h that's not going to work, but I can use it to just test out how I want to execute this idea. Then Marcia glanced at it and she was like, ""Oh, it's so cute and tiny."" And I was like, ""My brother, maybe tiny isn't so bad after all. Maybe maybe this is perfect adequate size. Maybe seeing the little avatar guy on this tiny screen made me think of Tamagotchi. You know those '90s virtual pets that everyone had? I love the look of Tamagotchis. I love the nostalgic feel of Tamagotchis, but I got to be honest, and maybe I'm the only one, I hated the Tamagotchis. They were so annoying to me to always take care of them. I know that was the whole point, but it felt like a chore. So that's when I came in with a billion dollar idea. What if instead of you taking care of Tamagotchi, Tamagotchi take care of you? Or that way. My brain exploded with ideas. I was like, it it can give you quests. You can level up. It can be like a habit building device. It can still show you what to wear for the weather. It still does that, but also so much more. I told this idea to Mars and she came up that I should do like a water tracking to make sure you're drinking enough water during the day. I pretty much swim in G-Fuel, so that's not necessary for me, but uh she said it was actually useful. And she said that water tracking apps that are free on your phone are absolutely terrible. So I checked it out and can confirm they are terrible. So I thought I could build something like that. And then I remember I used to have this function on my smartwatch where it was for meditation. It would tell you when to breathe in, hold your breath, and breathe out. And I just felt like it was really helpful. That's like a good habit that I would love to get back into. There's so many more things that you could do. Like what if it like gave you quests to of all the stuff that you forget about? like I don't know, call your mom, go to a park, compliment a stranger. But I wanted to keep it simple cuz I I've been doing this for way too long now. So I set a deadline for myself and I really crunched to get this last project done. I had to ditch the e- in screen because their refresh rate is terrible. It's not really built for that sort of thing and it didn't have partial refresh as well that some displays have. Marcia drew the Tamagotchi art and it looks so cute. She did such a good job. I really felt like this made it come to life. I added buttons for it this time instead and squeezing all of this into a tiny device was really hard. I tried my best. Now, I think it's best I'll just I'll just walk you guys through it. All right, here it is in all its glory. I couldn't fit the battery. It's like with a magnet. This is the on button. It takes quite a while to boot. I'm not going to lie to you. Oh, there we go. Man, Marta did so good with the art. Get a tan cuz it's hot and sunny. So, it's 29 degrees now and then in 5 hours it's going to be uh 22Â° and cloudy. This is actually really helpful. He's telling you to wear t-shirt and shorts. Basically, like if it was really really hot, he would technically be naked. Uh if it's really cold, he wears like a hoodie. I'll show Marcia showing the art cuz obviously now it's not cold. But yeah, I think it looks great. The buttons are the biggest weakness. Like they look terrible. I'm not going to lie, but they work. And I'm out of time. So, so you can navigate through, you click to change. This is the water tracker menu. So, you enter with middle button and then you can up how much you want to drink. 250 ml is a glass. So, you press it to register and it will add a glass. I've uh maxed it at eight. All right. So, moving on, we have the meditation screen. So, you can select how long you want to meditate. Let's say 10 minutes seems reasonable. You start it and then it should start with like breathe. Yeah. I thought that was too too fast. Hold it. All right. Love it. live, laugh, love it. So proud of it. Even though, you know, this is far from finished or even being anything practical to actually use, I wanted to just challenge myself to try my best. For me, this is just so exciting. I realized I love learning stuff. I've been so caught into daily YouTube videos for so long, I feel like I never learned anything or built anything for myself. I always wanted to invent stuff, but I never had the time and the skill or honestly just the patience. This is kind of stuff I would love to build with Bern when he's older if he has some kind of crazy idea or interest in it at all. I don't know. I'd love to share more stuff with you guys if you want to subscribe. Thank you so much for letting me yap. That's it. And uh [Music] Bro, this video is sponsored by SY. I am a huge fan of Sy because it genuinely makes traveling for us so much easier. This time when we were on our way to Savannah, Marcy asked me about it and we literally set it up on the flight cuz it had internet. For those you don't know, Sy is an eim app which means electronic SIM. So if you're traveling almost anywhere in the world, over 60 countries, you get access to internet through this app. Mine said just open the app, pick the country, picked how much data she needed, and of course, use code PewDiePie, which gave her a 15% discount, and bada bing, bada boom, instant internet as soon as you land, which is what I want. The first thing I want when I land is internet. I genuinely hate I hate standing in line when I land a Wi-Fi box. How is that a good solution? You just have to carry another thing when you're traveling that also have to worry about being charged. Or if you opt to just buy a physical SIM while you're there, you still have to go and actually find where to buy it. Set it all up while you're there and you have to worry about losing your original SIM. At least I do. It's kind of important. I don't like removing it. SY just solves all the problems. It's an amazing service and I highly recommend it. You can use the QR code to download it or use the code PewDiePie at checkout for 15% discount. If you're planning a trip anywhere, you can download it right away. set it up all now and don't even have to think about it. You need internet when you travel. So, I just love that it removes that stressful element to me. So, thank you Sy for being an amazing sponsor and you guys are welcome. [Music]",unknown

We'll see if my legs will be able to handle [Music] it. Today we're going kind of through the mountains. So, this is the only conveni stop. Middle of nowhere Japan kind of stuff. So, and it's starting to rain. This is such a nice road. Say hi to the vlogs. How you doing, Grace? I'm relishing this. Relishing. I'm like turning my back into a sail. The wind. We got We were fighting the wind for so long and now we got the wind on our back and it makes such a difference. Don't even have to pedal. Hello. How you doing? Sorry, I drunk fish. Literally, even though it's like a mess, it's really fun. Number one cause of death in UK. Cows. Yeah, they're the most dangerous animal. Ah, you're going to be on the vlog now. I don't know if you can hear me, but we're on the last 10 km. Still going strong. It's been really fun, but I got to wrap this up. Back in Tokyo. My legs are so tired. I'm so sore. But it's a really fun fun trip. We raised a lot of money for charity. Thank you everyone for joining. I had a really good time and I just can't wait to get [Music] home. You see mama. [Music] Howdy. We're going to Atami. We've been there once before. It's a really lovely area. A little mini holiday. There will be fireworks. There will be family activities and Easter holiday. Should be fun.

Don't make it seem like I'm playing with your toys. Come here. He doesn't know what to do with acorns. It's okay. Wow, this is magical. Chris said atami is called the Monaco of Japan. It's definitely an interesting vibe. Was that cool? Did you like that song? [Music] Where's mama? [Music] Ben loves to [Music] m Oh yeah. Wow. See you in the reflection. [Music] Cuckoo. Cuckoo. Cuckoo. Bye. Go [Music] morning. Today we're checking out Atami a little bit. We're going to have a couple of things we want to do. Uh but first on the list is the Shotgen, the shopping street. We're on the hunt for the yogurt, I think. Is it the yogurt? Pudding. The pudding. Sorry. The famous pudding here that we want to check out. Yes, the pudding. Yes, that's our car. Beep beep. [Music] This area is way bigger than we thought. It's really cool. Got that old style, too. That's well well done. [Music] The shops here are so cool. I love the look and vibe of this. It's so pretty. [Music] Oh, this is so cool. I love this area. Oh, you can see the castle from here. That's cool. We've been there. That's Castle. We found the line for the pudding. All right, the 6hour line pudding. Do I just drip it in like that? I hate pudding. The the consistency is all wrong, but this is good. It's really good. Bian is doing his very first egg hunt since it's Easter. Happy Easter. Shaka shaky. Shaka. What's inside? [Music] It's the bath toy. Check the Airbnb. Wa! You found another one.

Oh my god. It's like a cat on water. It's the sand. [Laughter] First time touching water this year. Will it be hot? Will it be cold? Oh, that is really good. Here we go. Sorry. I'm sorry. Don't torture my If mama was here, she would never allow [Music] it. Where is he? Where [Music] is There you are. There you are. I see you. I see you. [Music] Scared. [Music] It is way past this little guy's bedtime. The fireworks are starting now. Are you excited? [Music] Whoa. [Music] Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. They go all out, huh? Goodness. They're doing it just for us. Spirit. Oh, that's going to be big. [Music] That was so loud. Wow. Wa. That was [Music] amazing. They have this treehouse at the hotel we're going to check out. That might be a little big for us. Beer, where's your acorn? D found an acorn. He loves acorns so much. It's been so nice to stay at like a kid focused hotel cuz like they covered all the corners. They covered the sockets. They have toys. It's been so good. It's like all you want when you're traveling. This is so satisfying. [Music] I think it's time for a nap, huh? [Music] We're driven half across Tokyo cuz my son wants to go to this popup store. You can take it. It's okay. I don't know where we are. We're by the Tokyo Bay area. [Music] Three, two, [Music] [Music] Yay. Hey, I don't know where he is. Hey [Music] Yeah. Oh, I thought I heard something. What? Where is it coming from? Where is it coming from? Is it from fire? There you are. Okay, I didn't find you yet. Imagine this totally plausible scenario.

pVI_smLgTY0,"Oh, you little K. Oh. Oh, you po. You disgusting little thing. Oh, what happened to you? Oh, look at yourself. You're the blob from I have no mouth, but I must scream. What? Who did this to you? Was it Windows? Oh, Mac OS. Oh, don't worry. I can save you. Install Linux. What if I told you you can look like this? Anyway, let me start this off by saying I am not a tech guy. You saw my PC building video. Looks all bent. I'm surprised the whole thing hasn't exploded. It's like sitting next to a bomb every day. But what you did see was 0.5 seconds of the video where I installed Linux on the thing and a lot of people just went, ""What? What?"" Some people seem surprised and confused. Something possessed him to put Linux on it. Some people were excited. At the time, I didn't know the power that I had. I was like a baby with a rocket launcher. For years, I have been tortured by window. But now, alas, I am finally free. I escaped the Windowscape. I saw the sun. The shadows are gone. It blinded me for a moment and now I'm speaking to you in the cave. Enough reference. Okay, so I'm going to yap about Linux for as long as this video is and you're going to listen. I want to start off by going through the reasons why I switched to Linux. It's different for everybody. Number one is how backlit this shot is. Number one, Windows talks to me like I'm a baby. Now mentally I might be, but that does not warrant. You want Candy Crush? You want Candy Crush on your computer? You want to use Bing? Yes. Are you sure you want to delete that file? Are you super duper sure you want to delete the file? That's how the talks to me and I don't like it. Linux, on the other hand, literally puts a gun in your hand and says, ""Do it. You're got your now."" My first sort of aha moment when I installed Linux or started using it was wait a minute it does exactly what I wanted to do. And this is a really powerful feeling about that. I do want to show you guys my setup as well. I will get into that. But first, reason number two. As an epic minimalist, the bloat the bloat is real. It always bothered me. Anytime I install a new Windows, I spent like an hour trying to uninstall all the prepackaged BS that I don't want. Windows is like, ""I know you paid $100 or whatever for me, but uh I'm still going to put ads in here."" Yay. Put a little AI in here. You want that, right? That doesn't benefit me. It's for you, the consumer. Bing. It doesn't benefit me that you use Bing, but please use Bing. Microsoft is an annoying suite apparently. With Linux, nothing. Serenity, please. Don't even get me started on the Windows taskbar. You control what's on your computer. Duh. It's obvious. How is this not a thing? Reason number three, customization. I discovered this afterwards. Customizing on Linux is a beautiful thing. On Windows, you can maybe change your wallpaper, change a little bit of colors. Whoopitydoo. On Linux, you can change reality itself. Since Linux is built modular, you can swap out your GUI entirely. You don't even have to use one. You can cut off the head of Linux and it'll still be like, ""Hey, I'm here. What's up?"" Customizing on Linux is called rising. And I got I got way too into I got way too into it. I cooked hard. I I I can't wait to show you guys. Now, reason number four, gaming. Gaming on Linux is finally real. I actually installed Linux 15 years ago. That's right. I'm old. And I uninstalled it after like a couple days as a lot of people do when they realize, oh, I can't use the things I need on Linux. And for me, that was gaming back then because it's like, well, then what's the point? But now gaming on Linux is real at last. So Valve came in like Gandals in Hell's Deep riding a Steam Deck with Proton. So I think this is a perfect example how Linux benefits everyone. the fact that Valve as a company recognized maybe Microsoft has a bit too much power if they wanted to and started being shady locking things down taking cuts they absolutely could and it's not like it would be uncharacteristics for them to do so Valve started improving gaming on Linux boost and driver support and they built on what was already there from open- source software like Wine by doing this Valve benefits consumer benefits ecosystem grows win it really feels like uh an alternate reality. This totally could not have been a thing. And it also makes me realize just how many things can be better if people just weren't so greedy. Can we just fix them? So, thank you Linux and thank you uh base Gabin. Now, I've gone through the reasons why I switched to Linux. Let me just explain why maybe not switching is a good idea. Because everything good comes with a sacrifice. If you're swapping to Linux, you'll likely have to give something up. I don't know what that is, but for me it was Photoshop. I used Photoshop again for 15 years. All the shortcuts, all my workflow, it's all baked into my brain. The way I use Photoshop, it's I don't think about it. It's just here's the thumbnail. It's not beautiful, but I get the job done. Unfortunately, Adobe is a garbage company and their software just won't run on Linux. A lot of artists are jumping ship. They don't want to use Adobe anymore because they realize it's a terrible company. me as well. I thought, you know what, it's time. I'll swap over. I know the open source alternative is I've heard about this forever. And I thought, you know, it'll feel good. I'll feel good leaving Adobe. So, I I'm ready. I go to their website. I click through this thousand pages. I crawl through the bushes just to find the goddamn unsubscribe button. And I was so ready. I was going to be like, ""Fuck you, Adobe. Just unsubscribe."" You know what happens? You know what happens? They hit me with an unsubscription fee. Yes. Those I'm sorry, what? I have to pay to not use your software. It was like 65 bucks or some insane. What the? If anything, it just made me realize, okay, it's over. I'm never going back. So, like I said, the open source alternative is And since this is Linux open source, you can do whatever you want. I downloaded this uh icon pack, then change the icon so they look like the Photoshop icons. That helped a little bit. Then I downloaded a shortcut command list that matches the one on Photoshop. Boom. Made it a little easier. You know, I'm still not 100% used to it, but the fact that I can do stuff like this really helps for me personally, a worthy sacrifice. I hope this doesn't sound like copium, but genuinely, it feels good that I was able to move on. At the end of the day, some tools are only going to work on Windows and only going to work on Mac, but what you gain on Linux is so much more freedom. Join us. I'm just praying that Adobe is not just going to show up one day and be like, ""There's another fee. I'll meet them in a dark alleyway. They'll be like, that's a little fee. Now that I've convinced you to swap to Linux, you have the wonderful choice of picking a dro. Yay. So many of them. I hear people going like, I don't know which one to pick. What do I do? There's so many. Just pick one. It It's a wonderful thing that you can choose. Don't you understand? The world is your flavor. Look at all these spices. I went with Mint because it's the same one that I installed 15 years ago and I knew that it was a beginner friendly and that it still holds up. It very much feels like Windows just better. Okay, you don't even need to touch the scary terminal. If you don't want to, you don't have to. It's okay. You should though. Now, let's jump into my computer really quick. Oh, look at that. I'm recording with OBS. Open source is always the best source. Couldn't get bandicked. They didn't have a bed. I can't believe I paid for that. There's like free versions everywhere. That's so much better. Okay. All right. So, this is the terminal. You probably heard about it in Linux. Feels a bit strange in the beginning. Let me just show you how it works. But first, wait. Oh, yes. Today's sponsor. 3 2 1 Wrong Chief. Wow. Oh, look at ASI art every I love it. Beautiful PewDiePie tub. Right now, you get a free PewDiePie shaker cup, which is amazing deal.

And then I have my laptop, which I called Dianus cuz I wanted to mess around with it. I Dianis is the one I really, really went hard on the rising. Uh, but I just wanted to show some terminal commands really quick just so you get an idea how it works. I talked about this in my last video, but the first thing that really blew my mind with the Linux. I just noticed my computer was booting kind of slowly. So, I found this command called system deanalyze and it tells you exactly how long it takes for your computer to actually load and what part takes a certain amount of time. And it used to be like 45 seconds. I was like, dude, this is terrible. So, then I found another command called blame. And then you can see exactly what part is kind of slowing down your system which got me into like really optimizing it. And I had so much fun doing that. And it just made me realize just like on Windows if my computer is kind of slow you just kind of deal with it. It's like oh okay well what can you do on Linux it's like the world is your oyster. You can fix it. Personally I like that kind of stuff. The second thing that blew my mind with the Linux terminal was uh just how fast it is at searching. Searching on Windows is so annoying. It takes forever. Sometimes it doesn't even find the file even though you type the name of it perfectly. And a lot of times they just bing it. They're like, ""Oh, you want to search for your file? Oh, maybe no. Actually, you you want to you want to look it online. You that's what you want to do."" It's like, ""No, Linux, you can find any file, whatever you want. This is searching all JPEGs on my computer."" That's a bad example, actually. The other thing that I love about it is that you don't have to just search the file. You can also search text inside the file. So let's say you forgot what the file is called, but you remember roughly some stuff inside it. You can grap it and bada bing, bada boom. What the hell is this Spotify password text balls deep? I did not do that. What? Searching files on Linux is super fast. It made me realize just how it should be on a computer. Again, the most obvious thing with the terminal is that let's say you install the operating system and you need to also put all the programs that you want to use on it. Usually, you have to go on the browser, Google it, look up their page, go to their download page, dodge all the fake fake ads and all that crap and do that and install and run each one, wait for it to install, yada yada. It takes forever. On Linux, you just go pseudo amp install. Uh, what do we want? We want VCE, Firefox, uh, OBS Studio. Boom. Thank you. And now I can sit and look at the screen and feel like I'm a hacker. Yes, I know what all of this means. Every single letter I'm soaking in with my brain. There's so much you can do with the terminal. It's insanely powerful. I can make a whole video about it, but I don't want to keep this too longwinding. And in reality, I just want to show you my rise on my laptop. To be honest, that's the whole reason I'm making this video. I had this old laptop. I mean, it's not that old, but I just never used it because I didn't really like using it. I mentioned before there's many distros of Linux, and uh I wanted to try one called Arch partially because of the meme. It's kind of become a meme because it's a little difficult to install Arch. So, it's like a flex to use it. For some reason, I went on a god run and I had no issue. I always get stuck on the dumbest ever for like 12 hours. So, I don't know what happened that time, but I also wanted to download Arch because it's a minimalist DRO. Whatever you put, or at least 90% of it is there because you decided to put it there. And it's also very highly customizable, which are two elements that I love. So, I knew I was going to love it. All right, let's go into my laptop. I think it makes sense for me to show it without any customization first because it just be confusing and I need to talk to people that aren't haven't used Linux. My first favorite thing which I have on Mint as well is just shortcuts on my keyboard to open programs, open terminal, open file manager, open browser, close it, whatever. It's all there. It's such a nice workflow and have a more keyboard ccentric way of using your computer, especially on a laptop. But even in general, you know, the whole like, okay, let me click on the start menu and just find the thing. If I don't have it keybind, I can open roy uh and just search for it and open it. I don't want to overexlain things as well, but yeah, this is my terminal on uh this setup. I'm using elacrity and this is Neoetch, which shows my specs and usually people have an ASI art. It sounds like I'm saying as a Ashley, I'll call it Ashie uh of their dro. And if you saw my mint one earlier, I was like, ""Oh, it wouldn't be cool if I do like my own custom ashy."" And then I thought, ""Oh, wouldn't it be cool if I do my own animated ashy?"" So, I figured out how to do that. It took a little bit of tinkering and shinkering, but it's just so nice to look at. I love it. So, I'm running Hyperland, which is uh this uh beautiful tile manager. It automatically sorts it for me whenever I open something. This is such a nice workflow. And I can close it all as well. Uh you can literally open these until infinite. When you're on a laptop, when you have limited screen space, it's such a great way to work with it. The fact that they're always there means I never have to look for them because I know they're there. And if my workspace is full, I can get look at this. Swap to another one. This is workspace number two and workspace number four. I've been recording OBS from here. Let's say I'm working on a project on workspace one. I can then work on another thing on workspace 2 and go back and forth vice versa instantly. I love this way of using a computer. It's so sick. The first thing I really loved about this RH Hyperland setup was just how quick and smooth it looks at least, you know, like boom. Oh, open. It's so nice. Uh, but then I open my browser and it's like, oh, you see that? Ew. Again. Oh, that took forever and it loads so ugly. So, my first thought, okay, well, maybe I can upgrade my SSD to make it snappier and quicker. But then I thought, I'm on Linux. I can do whatever I want. So, let's run a time here. Firefox. Let's ignore the CSS errors. I tinkered a bit too much. Don't worry about it. What was that? Two seconds. Not good enough. So, I figured out a way. And it's so dumb. I won't explain how I did it, but the fact that I was able to do it. Boom. Instant. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. I love it. I love it so much. It's these small things that makes you really fall in love with using Linux. Uh anyway, the first thing I customized was a way bar. Oh, I forgot to say I can move around as well if I want to. Anyway, and move them to a different workspace. Uh so yeah, this is my taskbar. It's like the Windows taskbar except you decide exactly what's on it and customizing it. I put calendar, turn it on and off, internet, Bluetooth, quick access to all these things. You know, I really enjoy this as well. It's basically just tells me if I'm connected to NordVPN or not and I can toggle by clicking on it and it tells me which country I'm connected to. Uh up here it shows which workspace I'm using. Since I'm have these reactor in the background, I thought it'd be cool to like LAR as if each workspace was each reactor. I'm on reactor A. Uh there's reactor B and C and then D where it's recording OBS. Then I have my battery bar which is ASI. I keep call saying ashy versus ashy art. I got the volume and you know look look if my volume goes too low it gets red. It's critical just to really lar the whole nuclear reactor UI. To me it's cool. I like it. All right. The second thing I did was making widgets with Ew. Ew was a nightmare. I'm not going to lie. Here we go. Let me also change the wallpaper really quick. Was I? All right. So, this is my desktop. Let me play some music actually. So, first I added this visualizer cuz I just saw a lot of people doing it. It's using Cava, but I changed it again with Ashie. Uh, so it looks a little more matrix than Here we have my up time. Just how long it's been running and how much until my battery is out. I should probably charge my laptop. Uh, CPU temp. I should probably uh change cool it down a bit. All of this is uh it changes uh it's not just like visual flare. Well, it is, but CPU load, which changes, RAM usage, storage. This tells me which uh works base I'm on. Right now, I'm on reactor B. Power consumption completely useless, but I needed it to look cool. And then we have my two fans for CPU and GPU, and then this little spinny fan thing to show it. uh upload and download latency and then just another VPN thing. It's kind of pointless. And then uh basic weather. And then finally, to make it sort of all work together, I added a script that basically scans if I'm using a window. So if I open or close, it sort of transitions in and out of way bar because I don't need it on both. That it's just like too much information in my opinion. So this is on my desktop. It's a nice vibe here. We just chill over here and then when I'm in workflow, it blackens it all out. And I can just get going on my shingy thingy. Oh, and and in the middle here, my I forgot to say my it has power profiles my laptop. So, I thought it'd be cool to change them. It's silenced, balanced, or uh power mode, but I changed it to Rason, which means overclock. You see my fans are spinning. And these are faster as well because uh the fans are spinning more. This is so sick to me because I'm remembering what this laptop used to be running Windows. I never wanted to use it. I hated it. Now it went from a hardware that I never used to my favorite piece of hardware because it not just looks great, it runs great. I love it. It's so sick. I had so much fun customizing this. It was just a blast. Yeah, I hope you guys appreciate it as well. I've been doing so much more. I built this camera as well. Like I mentioned earlier, you can communicate with Linux even without a graphical user interface GUI. That made me so excited cuz I'm like, wait, that means I can use other computers at my disposal. For some reason, to me, that's just like really cool and I wanted to try what I could do with it. I want to show this in another video maybe cuz I feel like uh it's too much yapping. But my point is I've been having so much fun just tinkering, messing around, feeling like a hacker. But I got to be real as well. Linux is not perfect. There's a lot of issues. A good example is again my laptop. When I first installed Arch, none of my F keys worked. Actually, sorry. Three out of 12 worked out of the box. So, I had spent a long time bringing them back to life. For me, it was kind of fun. I was like, ""Oh, got another one working."" Like, ""Okay, let's move on to the next one."" But I can imagine for a lot of people that just want things to work, you know, maybe this is not for you. And maybe it should work. You know, I think since Linux is not as popular on desktop as Windows or Mac, this is just the reality. There's just not enough support for it. On Linux, if something doesn't work, it's kind of up to you to fix it. And uh and yeah, that's just how it is. I was trying to update my drivers for my GPU, and I got a black screen six times and had to do a hard restore every time. It's, you know, not the most fun thing in the world. There are other things I could rather be doing, which is why I need you to install Linux. So the more people we can get together, the better Linux becomes. And I get it now. Like that's why people were so excited about me using Linux because Linux is not a product. It's it's a platform. And it also already exists everywhere. NASA, SpaceX, it runs on Linux. All the supercomputers, your TV, your smart fridge, your phone if it's Android, it's all Linux, baby. I think it's just so cool the fact that this all happened because one Finnish guy in like the n what was it the '90s just decided, hey, I can write a better kernel. Finnish naivity. Typical Finnish behavior. They think they can do anything. But without that, you know, things would have been very different. At least there wouldn't been alternative. And I I just think it's so cool that people saw what it did, got excited, and wanted to join in. So, please consider joining in. Now, if you're even just a little bit curious, I recommend trying Linux. Maybe try dual booting it if you're not sure. You can still keep your Windows or whatever. You're going to kill it later. You might as well kill it now. Test it out. Break it. Get upset on Linux. I feel alive at last. At long last. Thank you for watching. Let me just type out my [Music] goodbyes. No.",unknown
tMIDpbmFoL8,"[Music] Three. Run away. Run [Music] away. Four. Three. [Music] Okay, I run away. [Music] I go hide. I go hide. I go [Music] [Laughter] [Music] hide. Yay. Yay. [Applause] [Music] Yo, uh, big announcement. We bought a land. Feel like it's a lot more to talk about, but basically we're, uh, going to a place that does construction and they're going to show kind of what they can do cuz we're actually going to build a house. In Japan, for those who don't know, everyone builds a house and they have like really fast method of building. So yeah, we'll share that process with you guys. [Music] 300 400 Oh, you hear Yeah. Yeah. It's making me anxious. I don't know. I think I got 700. Damn, that's actually pretty stupid. Double strength. Yeah. Hold on. Yeah, it's still going. Oh. Oh, it barely cracked, too. Wow. Oh, it's still going. What a weird test. Okay. Am I supposed to touch here? Yeah, you can touch there and see if it's anymore. Oh, there it goes. Okay. Oh, so the other side is that hot? Yeah. Jeez. Yeah. 400Â°. Well insulated. Yep. You don't even feel it. You could build these houses in hell. It'll be fine. [Music] I got you. I got you. Now he's spinning. What are you doing, Ben? Hey, Ben, are we going on a walk? A [Music] walk? Darren, can I have a flower? Can I have a flower? Thank [Music] you. This video is sponsored by SY. I am a huge fan of SY cuz it genuinely makes traveling for us so much easier. This time when we were on our way to Savannah, Marty asked me about it and we literally set it up on the flight cuz it had internet. For those you don't know, SY is an eim app, which means electronic SIM. So if you're traveling almost anywhere in the world, over 60 countries, you get access to internet through this app. M said just open the app, pick the country, picked how much data she needed, and of course use code PewDiePie, which gave her a 15% discount, and bada bing bada boom, instant internet as soon as you land, which is what I want. The first thing I want when I land is internet. I genuinely hate I hate standing in line when I land renting a Wi-Fi box. How is that a good solution? You just have to carry another thing when you're traveling that also have to worry about being charged. Or if you opt to just buy a physical SIM while you're there, you still have to go and actually find where to buy it. Set it all up while you're there and you have to worry about losing your original SIM. At least I do. It's kind of important. I don't like removing it. SY just solves all the problems. It's an amazing service and I highly recommend it. You can use the QR code to download it or use the code PewDiePie at checkout for 15% discount. If you're planning a trip anywhere, you can download it right away. Set it up all now and don't even have to think about it. You need internet when you travel. So, I just love that it removes that stressful element to me. So, thank you S for being an amazing sponsor and you guys are welcome. [Music] It's International Women's Day today and in Italy you give mimosa. So I've been tracking down where to find them. It's been really difficult but I finally found them. This one is great. Let's get this one. There you go. It's for mama. It's for mama. Careful. Careful your step there. again. What do you have there? He was crying because I didn't let him touch them. How do they smell? Do they smell nice? What do you have for mama? Show mama what you have. [Music] It's kind of snowing. Yeah, it is. It's a very wet snow, but it's still [Music] snow. We are back at Sun and Shine City. One of our earliest vlogs was actually here. We went to the aquarium here and we're back with this guy. The coolest guy on the planet. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There's a bunch of cosplay going on. I think we went to the wrong place. So many people dressed up. I don't even know the anime anymore. I'm so out of touch. Did you pick the one? Which one did you pick? Oh, you got the puffer macaron. So cute. [Music] Whoa. What happened? I got scared. Whoa. That's what happened. Where do you come from? [Music] Yeah, I know. [Music] Doesn't want to leave the big aquarium place. [Music] 72. Do you like this place, Ben? They're bigger than you, Ben. [Music] When we're [Music] going touching them, [Music] We're taking the elevator. [Music] Okay, he loves this. Wow, what a view. I never been here before. I didn't know even know about it. It's super nice. Very central Tokyo. But yeah, it's lovely. Oh, they have more play area. It's good. Y just wants to play. [Music] Happy boy. Did you have a good nap? [Music] Tastes great. New recipe out in our newsletter. Might as always post a Oh my gosh. Wow. Yay. Can you do it on your own? Bravo. That was so cool. You did it all in your [Music] own go. This is the land we want. So, they're going to start building on Halloween. Everything's moving very fast, but really good. Like we're super excited. It's going to be amazing. We looked for land for like a year until we actually found one. Show that much. I'll show that [Music] much. We just went through. This is our first layout. We're really amazed by it. We had a lot of changes still, but I think it's going to be cool. We're going to have a theater room, sunken living room, open space, the dolls get an area. It's super exciting. Are you ready to game? Are you ready to win all the prizes? Okay. Okay. Okay. Here we go. All right. You pull this forward. Oh, you have to start. Yes. And then when you're ready, you press this one. Yes. A. So close. Not yet. Turn the crate. Now you can go. Now you can go. Yes. Oh, so close. No. So close. And he's starting. This is it. Yay. You won. You won it. Yes, you did. Bravo. Yes, you did it. Your favorite is the stool and putting the money in. There you go. Bian. Oh, we got it. You can grab it. It's stuck. That is the Yay. Yay. I wanted to win something for mom. What do you guys think of this? Bern could technically crawl. You could crawl in here. Bern get the prize for me. Bad inflict. Oh, this is the one mama wanted. We have to win it for her. How would I possibly get it? How? He's too f He's too He's too big. Oh my god. Yes. Yes. We did it. Y we got it. Is that our crank? Wow. Ven. Wow. We won for mama. I had a lot of fun. Yeah. Let's go and get a snack. We don't tell mama about this. Okay. You don't like it? There's nothing in there, but he's [Music] still Oh. Oh, careful. [Music] [Applause] [Music] More. More. You want more? [Laughter] My hair. Look at my hair. Thank you much. We're going to the strawberry farm. Second year in a row with Vern. Super good weather for it. We're going to be inside. It's okay. The strawberry man is ready. It was raining. Last year we went as well. What are the odds? [Music] Oi more. [Music] Not that part. We got a big [Music] one. We got big beer. No, that's mine. It's too big for you. Do you like the strawberries? I'm done. You are a monster. Here, beautiful. You can do it. You can reach strawberry. [Music] He's got a gun. Whoa. What? Oh, I was like, is that loot there? [Music] Whoa. Come [Music] here. Bye. That's a guinea pig. [Music] Today we're flying. We're going on another big trip all across the world. Why do we do it, Beer? To go to special place. Well, for M. I gifted a trip for uh our anniversary. That was right. I forgot about that. We're going to Savannah. We've been there a couple a long time ago. One time. Uh so we're going to explore that area again. We really loved it. It's very pretty. Cherry blossom has just started, so we're getting a little sneak peek before we leave. And hopefully they're still here when we come back. Wow, they've already bloomed here. The birds are loving it. Oh my goodness, they're all over, man. Such a magical time. How can you not be happy seeing this? [Music] And what are you doing? We're back at the playground. Let's see if you can do these. They were difficult last time. Do you know how to go down the slide? Yes. With your feet up front. Yes. Yay. That was the first time on your own. [Music] Again, I got you. You're too slow. I got you. You going to tap out? He's too fast. He's too fast. Up. You're going up. That's right. So small. [Music] All right, 14 hour later, we're in Chicago about to board to Savannah finally and then we got 3 or 4 hour flight, I think. [Music] All right, almost uh 22 hours later, we are in Savannah. It's St. Patty's Day today. I didn't even know they got all this all this decoration going on. They said to be careful is people are crazy. Ben, what do you think of the car? Is it a cool car? [Music] Cat or a early start today. 5 a.m. Not too bad. Exploring the hotel. [Music] Hello. [Music] Hello. And he's off. I forgot how pretty the trees are here. Our hotel is right there. Uh we're just going to walk around a bit. Jet lag is kind of hit us weird. It's 2:30 already. Let's find a place to eat. Oh man, everything's so pretty. We came at night, so we didn't see anything. [Music] You want to smell the flower? You kissed the flower. That's so nice. You kissed the flower. Beern's first squirrel. Where'd he go? There it is. Squirrel, son. Did that squirt. You never see Oh, he saw it. Slow day today. We're just walking around. You want a cookie? Give the man his cookie. This is so pretty everywhere here. I forgot how pretty it was. We were here, like I said, seven years ago. More, maybe more. The trees are so insane. They're everywhere. He fell at a man's ass. It's a bad way to go. All right, let's go to the play park beer. Is your hair Is your hair a little static? Huh? [Music] Same spot. 10 years. 10 years. We're old. Oh, I thought maybe six. He wants applause. Squirrel. M's on a mission. What are you going to do? Did I scare him off? Where is it? Where's the squirrel? Come down, you little rascal. [Music] He's simping [Music] again. The last ride. I remember we went and it was so scuffed that it was so bad. But it was fun because it was bad. Love it out here. I don't remember much at all from our trip. You're gonna get soaked. What are you doing, Bernie? No. That's a big bird. Tabian. Do you see? This is the Force Gump uh park where he sits by the bench. We've been here before as well, but we figured we'd check it out because it's a really pretty square. Anyway, my mama always said, ""Lovely to see Savannah again."" We're coming back, but first we're going to Alabama tomorrow. Long car ride. We're going to towards where they shot Big Fish, Spectre of the City. It should be really cool to see a dream of Maria that we need to fulfill. Throw the shoes. Yeah. This is so nice here. I love it. So pretty. Everyone who lives here. So lucky. Can you take a photo? Oh, maybe. Take a photo. Yes. Wow. You're a professional. [Music] He just wants [Music] food. Oh, it's so cute. Oh my goodness. Sorry, mate. All right. Ma says there's a ghost. What happened? Ben, how did you do [Music] that? It's [Music] a What do you think about this? Nice. You're so funny. It's 3:30 a.m. Here we are in the lobby again. Bang. Huh? Whoa. Ben. Whoa. Did you kiss [Music] it? We're driving to Alabama. We've been driving 2 hours. We got two more hours to go. We're enamored by the American scenery. I'm too loud. I'm sorry. No. Notice how there's no people on the rocks. Where are they? We don't [Music] know. Can you blow on him? Oh, big road trip today. Stopped at a random place. It's really It's really caught nice for a just a food court. Can you do a big blow? Yeah, that was a good blow. Yeah, Bravo. He's smiling. He's bringing me a mama. [Music] What happened to you? One gas station. Come back with a hat and Oh, well, we're going to get rich. I thought you'd have what I would when I win. When I win. That's mine. You just scratched mine. What is it? How much? We got the gold. You have to tell me. You're killing me. Okay. A million. 2 million. $1. What did we win? Another dollar. Oh my god. Is it Is it another dollar? Yes. You got zero. Come on. $5. $5. $5. [Music] America. That looks so silly with his hat. We're at our first stop. Well, first and only. She I'm so I'm so tired. Whoa. We are at the canyon. Not the Grand Canyon. Just a canyon. It looks pretty. Wow. What can you see? Oh, it's pretty. Wow, that's beautiful. Amazing. Wow, what a pretty canyon. Wow. Wow. [Music] Woo! He's tired. [Music] Yeah. Ba. [Music] We are off on another 2hour car ride. I don't know why I said another. Yesterday was five. But uh that will reach our destination. The reason we came. Do you want to come with us? You want to come in? Jump in. We got seats in the back. Beep beep. We're at the famous Olive Garden. I never been, so we thought we'd stop by. We'll see what the fuss is all about. You guys want to get an appetizer for a thousand for half your daily calories? An appetizer? Goodness gracious. What do I even eat here? You want to get some spinach? Oh, it's You get an iPad and you get James. What the We're here. I hope the weather is I mean the weather could be better, but in Sweden we say no bad weather, only bad weather. [Music] Howdy. There's a lot of goats here. Oh, they're all coming up. It's a blind scenic drive around the island. This is a movie set. That's so cool. You see it? She's so happy. She's so cute. What is this? You have to explain. I I don't know. What is this? And then all of a sudden, but this is an actual tree. No way. It's a set, isn't it? Oh, I thought it was real. This looks amazing. So, in the movie before entering the town, they throw the shoes and people throw their shoes. I got to throw my shoes. There it is. Big fish. That's where they throw the shoes. This is so cool.

[Music] And if you look over here to the right, you'll see the diamond pour house here. Baptist church formed after the first African back from the Savannah River, which is no longer available. If you looked closely at the bricks, you'd still be able to see the fingerprints in the hands. Are you drawing in my draw? That's my sketchbook. What are you drawing in my sketchbook? [Music] Oh, Bernie. [Music] Come on. He's not sure what to think. Mr. Turtle's name is moving. This is Pogo. Hey, Pogo. He's about 3 years old. So cute. He's a yellowbellied slider.

Oh man, it's We had such a fun trip. We both really really enjoyed our time. But I think coming back as well, both me and Martia really felt like it felt more more than before.

Gwen. Hey. Hey. Come on. [Music] The [Music] answer [Music] is these days. I got to worry about protecting my data. I got to worry about protecting my privacy. And I got to worry about protecting this guy. But thanks to NordVPN, that's easy. You can let go of the microphone. What are you doing? Come to think of it, I could have used NordVPN when I was growing up. The internet is full of stuff that you don't want to stumble into, let alone your kids. But thanks to NordVPN's threat protection, it blocks ads, trackers, and malicious websites. Obviously, this is very far ahead. Okay, but it's a piece of mind for me and myself. What did I just say? Recently, I switched to Linux and NordVPN works just as good there as any other operating system, even your phone. It connects fast and works amazing without you having to worry about it. [Applause] Hey, hey, that way I can browse the internet safely and securely and privately as it should be. NVPN is seriously so good.

iphxJqWZX1Y,"Dreams. Dreams are probably one of the most uninteresting and boring things that you can talk about. Show us your tit. Which is why I made an entire video. Listen, dreams get a bad rep. While most people ignore their dreams completely, myself included my entire life. I did this experiment where I started a dream journal. I can't believe I'm saying that unironically, but I realized dreams are incredible tools. You just got to know how to use it. and I'm going to teach you. So, I decided to log my dreams for 30 days just to see what would happen in my dream journal. I had very little expectations going into this, but the result was actually really, really surprising. Part of me don't even know if I want to share it. Now, the reason I decided to do this was not to charge my chakra or align my uh inner frequency with the moon. It was because of these two guys. I wanted to do this because of Nietze and Yung. Nze was one of the first philosophers who understood the importance of the unconscious. He didn't see dreams as this random nonsense but as an intrinsic art and in our dreams we create without filter and without logic to suppress this. It gives us a raw emotion and expression of ourselves. Jung then took this idea and basically ran with it and created a whole framework around it. And he believed that dreams were not just expressions from your inner self but also even conversations with it which would give you insight from the deepest part of you. You yes you I'm talking to you. You have a shadow not your physical one or or is it physical now that I think about it. I'm talking about the part of your mind that maybe you try and ignore or maybe you try and suppress. Maybe you're not even aware that you're doing it. It's the part of your mind that is filled with fears, desire, guilt, remorse, the kind of stuff you don't want to say out loud. And that's fine. We all have that shadow. So, we're going to do what Jung calls shadow work. I'm realizing just how much bunch of hoopa this all sounds like so far, but just hear me out. Okay. So, shadow work is taking notice of that part of you that you don't necessarily want to acknowledge and not fighting it, but rather listening to it and integrating it with yourself. So the goal of this for me keeping Nyong in mind is to try and listen to my dreams, see if there's any hidden messages from within that is trying to reach me. First off, the rules. Number one, no filter. I think for this to work, I have to be very clear with everything. Even if I don't think it makes sense or even if I think it's irrelevant or embarrassing, I have to make sure I put everything in there. Number two is what I've learned is I have to do is to write immediately after waking up because otherwise everything will be lost. It's the only way for this to really work. And number three, which is very important, is for me to be honest. I feel like people lie when they talk about their dreams a little bit. You know, they spice it up or maybe change things to be interesting. For this to work, I can't do that. I have to be 100% honest. Otherwise, what's the point? So, that's the rules. At first, when I was doing this, I couldn't remember a goddamn thing. When I woke up, I was too tired to write down my notes, and I thought maybe my dreams just they didn't seem interesting or important enough to write down. So, I didn't bother. But it wasn't until I really forced myself, that's when I realized piece by piece, this sort of image of my dream started to really come alive into this vivid idea and all of a sudden I realized, oh wow, there's so much there that I didn't even think about. Which leads to my very first dream. I finally had it. Do you dream? All right, here we go. I sketched it out so maybe it's more clear what I'm talking about. This dream was my first dream and I call it the shooting. It probably looks worse than it is. Just hear me out. I was at a fancy dinner party and uh Obama was also here for some reason and there was this ongoing game going on that everyone took part on. The game was simple and it's that you had to shoot that target over there in the corner, not the people. Uh but every time that it was my turn to play this game, something would go wrong. The gun would jam, it wouldn't fire, it would break, something weird happened. Every time that happened, the game had to reset. But the weird part was that every time it reset, the conditions of the game slightly changed and I could tell it made the game easier in my favor. Like I got an unfair advantage. Maybe the target got closer or something. Something happened that tipped the odds in my favor basically. And I was trying so desperately to take advantage of this, but every time it failed again and again and again. So I learned that if you want to analyze your dreams properly, you need to break down each element and every detail really matters. So here we had the setting which is the dinner party which is obviously how you present yourself to other people and this is fancy setting. Obama I thought was so insignificant at first but then I realized he actually means some I I just thought it was funny and silly. Oh, like Obama was there. That's crazy. I realized that Obama represents charisma, status, maybe authority and and it all ties into the setting. The gun that won't fire is clearly my ego, like my myself, my ego wanting to perform an action, but my unconsciousness is stopping me from doing it. You probably had a similar dream like that where you want to do something, but something is stopping you. And there's a reason for that. The game reset was difficult for me to understand. At first, I thought it was about unearned success and maybe guilt. That would make sense at least. But that doesn't make any sense because I'm extremely overconfident. But then it clicked. And uh this is where we get to the shadow part because for me it's a little uncomfortable to admit and it's the fact that I want to prove myself to other people. Sue me. Okay. But I sort of hate that I care. Part of me doesn't like that I feel that way. You know, I I still think back I got a compliment from a stranger like 12 years ago on the street and I'm still like that was what? And I think there's an irony to it of wanting to prove myself but by taking shortcuts to do that. It doesn't work. Clearly that defeats the whole point. And I think in my dream I didn't want to fake it till it till I make it, but rather fail than fake it. So maybe my shadow is telling me that I want authenticity over comfort. Maybe that's not such a bad thing. This is just how I analyze it. And a lot of it has to do with feelings and emotions. That's kind of hard to explain. But yeah, moving on. Moving on to the next dream. I had a dream that my butt was really itchy. Don't judge. And I woke up and my phone was blasting me with ads for butt lotion. I didn't search any of it. My phone just knew. Today's video is sponsored by Incogn. And we got an offer straight from your dreams. You can probably relate to the fact that ads just seem to know everything about you. Obviously, companies are tracking and storing your data. But the worst part is is that they're also trading it and selling it. This is a shady and lucrative business and companies are benefiting from your data. You might be like, ""I don't care about my data."" Well, they're making money of you. A lot of money. You should care. That's my money. You have the legal right to get removed from these databases, but it's an extreme uphill battle that you should not take on your own. Trust me. And that's where Incogn comes in. Your personal guard that will fight for you against these shady companies. I've used Incogn for years now, and I've been able to see all of my private information, poof, from the internet. I know that's ironic, okay? But like my number, my address, stuff that you don't want out online, right? So, it's a joy to see it just all disappear. All thanks to Incogn. A classic example is if you're getting spam calls, most likely you sign up maybe to a newsletter or whatever and then your data got sold and bam, you're screwed. So, if you care about your privacy, which you should, check out incogn.com/piepie and you will get 60% off. That's right. That's almost 100% which is free. It's not, but still. Link in the description, incogn.com/pie. It's super easy. You don't have to think about it. Highly recommend. Thank you Incogn for sponsoring this video. Now, back to my butt dreams. Uh, this one was just really cute because, uh, in my dream, I was playing this cute frog game and it was just like really happy and nice. It was a nice dream and then I woke up and it was because Bern was making too much noise. So it was like clearly this game childlike and playfulness was related to be and you probably done this too where what woke you up in your dream is what your dream is about. But I I didn't think there was any shadow here. It's just a cute dream. All right, dream number three. I call this the perfect house. I haven't announced this yet, but in real life, me and Maria are looking for a land to build a house here in Tokyo. And it's been something we've been doing for a while. And so it makes sense that one night when I was dreaming, we actually did find the land. Or at least, you know, it was something because it wasn't in Japan. It was somewhere in Europe. And it was just ginormous. It was so vastly open space. And I couldn't believe how big this land that we found was, which is of course because Tokyo is super limited on space. It's the complete opposite. But then as soon as we decided to get this land and we were about to leave, it became like a cliche horror and the doors just slammed shut and a message on the wall appeared and it wrote, ""You can't leave."" So unlike my shooting dream, this one was very on the nose. But it's funny, I didn't realize it while I was dreaming. It wasn't until I looked at my notes to see what the dream was about was that's when I realized, oh, duh. I just had this anxiety for a very long time of not knowing where to settle down. It's been incredibly difficult for me to come to that conclusion. I've talked about it in my vlogs and videos before, so it's not really by shadow revealing something new to me here. If anything, it felt quite rude that my subconsciousness decided to just throw this dumb analogy straight in my face. But obviously the whole you can't leave is the fear of getting stuck somewhere. It's obviously a big choice and I kept trying to reframe it or soften the idea or fix it. But then I realized maybe that's the problem. You know, I have this worry and fear or whatever. Maybe I just need to sit with it. Maybe I just need to acknowledge it. I don't know if you guys ever had that heavy thought or something, but as soon as you journal or maybe you journal and where you write it down and as soon as you done that, it's almost like it's left your mind even though you haven't done anything. It's almost like you feel lighter all of a sudden. And you know, I'm I'm extremely excited about building a home with obviously, but big decisions I think comes with that sort of fear. And uh I'm not immune to it. Dream number four, the break-in. I had this dream where three figures wearing fox masks broke into our house. This was, for those of you who don't know, our house was broken into 3 years ago. Even though I wasn't there, I I just hate how much this event has a hold on me mentally. Uh sometimes just to prove that this doesn't bother me, I kind of I don't check the doors obsessively or may maybe I left it unlocked on purpose, you know? It's like I'm challenging this fear that I have that someone would break in again. But then sometimes during the nights I I hear these sounds in the backyard. It could be animals walking through the garbage or whatever. And I swear someone's trying to break in again. It took me some time to realize this emotion. I think it's the fact that I don't want to acknowledge that I have this fear and that I've been fighting against it. I think maybe it's okay to have this fear and I'm hoping that by acknowledging it and instead of trying to fight it or conquer it, that's how I take the power back from it. I don't know. I had this dream where someone did surgery on my legs. I didn't really analyze it, but I drew it. I'm sure you guys will analyze it. The leg meme. What the [Â __Â ] I'll call this dream number five instead. The guitar. This dream I barely remembered. I just remember that I woke up feeling bad. And it was related to playing the guitar. I used to play guitar so much as a teenager. I've obviously stopped because I just pursued YouTube and I haven't had any time for any hobby. And I had been debating getting a guitar again for so long because I wanted to play songs for Bern. But I didn't get a new guitar because I was afraid that I was just going to abandon playing it again. So I kept thinking, oh, I should do it. And then I don't. Then I decided, why don't I just listen? So I bought a simple guitar and I played songs for Bern and and Mar and it's just been wonderful. I know it's kind of like duh. I think this was a pivotal moment for me where I realized my shadow or my unconsciousness or whatever you want to call it. It's not my enemy. He's trying to help me. He's sending me messages. I just need to listen. And it's kind of weird to refer yourself in that way, but I it just sort of clicked for me at least. I had so many dreams and I don't want to talk about all of them. Some were strange, some were the same ones in a different form. I dreamt the police caught me one night and the next day when I was telling Maria about this dream, the police literally rang on my door. Luckily, it was just to update their police records and they wanted to check our address, but I was freaking out. I was like, I manifested it. The last dream I had was the strangest one because I dreamt about this video or making this video. I had actually given up on this video idea because I just thought, well, dreams, no one wants to hear about them. I hadn't analyzed my dreams yet, and it all just felt so pointless and stupid. Like, you're seeing this video now, but I had completely given up on the idea. I think for some time now, I've been trying to make videos that feel more authentic to me, just videos that I actually want to make, and I've been doing that. But a lot of times when I doubt myself, I start looking for easier answers. I thought, okay, instead of this video, I'll just do like a react video. And it's nothing wrong with that, per se. With YouTube, it's always the the easier road where you can make videos that will automatically just do better. But then I realized that's literally the first dream. That's the shooting dream all over again of me trying to take shortcuts. I think when I doubt myself, that's when I start looking into those things. So, in spirit of actually listening to my shadow and and acknowledging it, here I am. I'm making this video for better or worse. And it feels good. I feel liner. Uh I hope you guys find it interesting and maybe you'll try this as well. Maybe you'll find that your shadow is has something interesting to tell you as well. So all you got to do is actually listen even if it's uncomfortable because one does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light but by making their darkness conscious. [Music]",unknown

Very underrated. [Music] You can stop drinking at some point. There we go. No. No. There it is. You were doing so well. You didn't see me, but here I am. [Laughter] [Music] Oh, the joy of IKEA. Excited to be in IKEA. [Music] so excited. Yeah. Is there a problem here, sir? [Music] What is it? [Music] 1st of March. It's not super sunny, but it feels really warm and springy. Like spring has definitely come. Just waiting for the Sakura, which probably will be another month at least. But that's lovely. [Music] M. You going to smell it? So amazing. They gave us some vegetables from their garden. Kumatsuna. Oh, he's fast now. Dangerous. Hello. [Music] Oh, [Music] turn. [Music] Uh, I wanted to update you guys a little bit. I talked about this before, but a thing that's I've really struggled with for the past year is the decision on what we should do uh with staying in Japan or uh moving back to Europe. I think especially now that we have Beern, I kind of have to think about what's better for uh everyone. And uh in many ways uh Japan makes no sense because we're so far away from family. We are far away from friends that we miss back home. And uh it's just made it very difficult because we we love living in Japan so much. We didn't know what it was going to be like before coming here. Just trying to come up with a decision has been so difficult. But we finally decided and we decided that we're staying. Don't know how long but for the future. And I'm just so happy that we finally made this choice. It feels uh so liberating. I don't know how to explain the fact that like it's just been in my head for so long that I'm I'm just so excited and it just feels right as well. This is where we love to be. Uh I think it will be great for Bern for the time being as well. Everyone jokes that he will have to learn four languages, but I guess that is true now for sure. Obviously, it's not going to be forever, but you can't really plan for that long anyway. And Japan has just been so good to us and uh we we don't feel ready to leave it yet cuz we really really love it here. And I think it shows in the vlogs too. It's just endless of things to explore here and we love every day dayto-day even when we don't do stuff. So also big thanks to everyone for supporting the vlogs. I'm about to cough. Looks like I'm about to cry, but I just my throat hurts. I should go with it. I'm crying. So thank you guys for watching and uh yeah, just want to let you guys know We've been traveling a lot in this vlog and the one thing that I always use when I travel is s has made my life while traveling 10 times better. While you guys and me myself in the past would wait in line, going through the hassle of renting a Wi-Fi box, having to carry an extra thing when you're traveling, worrying if it's charged or not, going through swapping out SIMs, worrying about losing your original SIM, all this stuff should not be a thing. And thanks to Sy, it's no more. SY is an e SIM that works in over 180 countries. And the best part is you can sign up before you even travel. Pick how much data you want to use and then don't have to worry about it. As soon as you land, it connects and you're done. So, while people are waiting in line to do all this extra stuff that you don't want to do when you're tired after traveling, I don't even have to think about it. It's the best. Why is this not been a thing already? You need internet when you travel more than ever. I told myself in the past for in other trips where I'm like, I'll just connect to Wi-Fi. I'll find free Wi-Fi and then it just becomes like such a huge hassle. That's never worth it. So, thank you Sy for being an amazing product that I love to sponsor and I'm also extra happy to be sponsored because I can hook you guys up with my discount code PewDiePie. You get 15% off. So, make sure you use that as well for the best pricing with this QR code. I highly recommend it. If it doesn't work for whatever, you get your money return. So, it's risk- free. Check it out. Thank you, sailing.",unknown

have to put it in put it in put it in put it in we did it got an Intel AMD version should I read these probably uhhuh okay I lift this I open and just put in okay that's it okay yeah we got the arrow there to indicate then oh oh this comes out nice next up Ram which I don't need I'm just going to download it but in case I'm getting backup Ram uh I love how this one has anime girls on it cuz Japan okay so opening this case has been the hardest part so far I assume these just click in but I actually don't know in which slots so these open I guess like one and two is it this way is it the other way spoilers it absolutely does matter which SL you put it in that's fun I thought this would be the easiest step I'm scared of pressing okay actually there was very little Force to that it doesn't lock though that's not good what the heck what's up and [Music] down thank yeah you think you're so funny M have points up and down you little Smurf okay I just use fours I hope that's not an issue two and four I think I should put let me double check this slots two and four counting from the CPU okay I try to put it upside down oh that was a good click okay I see it now okay that looks nice too nice a nice okay so next step is to put what we had built so far actually inside the case and now it gets a lot more fiddly I don't know why it feels dirty to build my new pc right next to the old one crying over there no oh I forgot I was supposed to like do the anti-static thing before you build cuz otherwise you can zap the whole thing I I didn't do that but I'm never static mindset always is she could never build a PC she had explode the whole thing okay so oh that comes off got all this gunk in here so I think these will hold the motherboard so I'm just going to put it in okay yes yes that looks good supposed to be screws here but I don't know where do I get the screws oh ah motherboard PS you I assume these ah I dropped it ah it's not magnetic enough it's magnetic enough no okay cool a lot more screws than I thought okay I think now is a good time hello you're awkwardly behind me to put in these I don't know where they go somewhere how do I know so these are the the buttons from in front of the case like you press on and stuff what is this say it HD audio okay it looks like it goes here does it reach I hope it does okay one one is done one is done this doesn't say what it is I have no clue it looks like it could fit there yeah that's it okay that one's correct pretty sure it goes here yeah done we'll tidy that up later okay next step is cooling time I probably could have fit a bigger cooler in there but I didn't think too much about it and here we are has this been used it's got already has the it it's pre Mama it already has the M the gunk on it is is that what okay ah okay I need to this has like a special bracket to fit over here but my first thing before I do anything it's just to make sure it fits it'll go like this quite beefy beefy boy wish is up and down yeah it definitely needs a different Mount and this will go like here okay that will work and then the fans too actually it's looking pretty good so far feel pretty confident feel pretty good you're going to die you're done you're done uh what do I start with the fans or the bracket I maybe the fans look at this industrial pee PE who comes up with the gamer gamer terms okay so do I mount them like this like this I have no idea so instead of the ones that they came with to match my athetic I'm going to install these ones cuz I don't think it matters a maybe it does matter okay we're testing now to see if this fits or not I actually have no idea might be too beefy yeah see that doesn't fit it could fit maybe that could fit it doesn't look bad either huh okay I did a bit of smogling Googling as long as they're uh 25 C M no 2.5 2.5 M 25 mm oh they're not okay what are these then oh okay fine I was doing so well here it all goes to  first all uh the fans were too big then I spent like an hour trying to understand which way the fans blow how am I supposed to know this so how do I know which like is up and down I have no idea I know I know they need to shoot down I just don't know do I blow on it oh that it's got to be this I figure it out cuz I'm kind of a genius I figured out fan if you just do this and feel air it blows it blows that way it blows this way [Music] well now I'm not so sure It Gos this way so surely I should install it like this now I'm second guessing everything that's it which side do you think the fan blows like do you if I do do you think it blows that way mhm are you sure it wouldn't blow this way yeah it blows like that right I think so too so it comes with these uh screws for the radiator so I wasn't crazy for switching out the stock ones these are slightly different so maybe these are the ones oh that's [Music] it and then yeah I got this neat covers for it I really like that small things that make difference very nice okay that's the fans done I'm willing to accept that maybe I put them the wrong way if that's the case I'll have to change it later but for now I think I think I did it right so now we do bracket bracket I think it's going pretty good so far in my head in my little world okay I think I will stand for this one it's going to be tight man it's going to be [Music] tight it's all falling apart stop will it fit will it fit yeah kind of it fits it totally smally fits nice that's going to look nice no my computer no no the cables goodness gracious ah I'm going to film I'm going to put the camera here seems like the obvious thing to do are you okay I hope I didn't break you oh get out of here next I just had to mount the cooler it's pretty easy but it's a bit weird if you never done it before because they need like a bracket I didn't know you needed a bracket let's remove the stock oh those are really in there huh okay so they have little arrows on them that's nice I like when they make it for dummies so it goes like that am I supposed to use this it does go let me double check doesn't feel like it goes what it supposed to do why do they give me this oh I need a third hand right [Music] now okay I couldn't find the screw I couldn't find the right screws so I'll have to change them later uh but for now I just want something to hold it in place it's not really flush oh cuz the cable is in the way and it is touching it What If This Were oh this is super tight I'm sorry what am I supposed to reach there God damn God damn how am I supposed to it's huge how am I supposed to reach there get out of here what I feel like uh if you're ever building a PC just do it have someone help you I don't know have no friends okay I think I'm going to break there because I spent 2 hours and uh I'm a dad I got other stuff to do but I'm very excited cuz I it's I think it's starting to look uh like a computer and I'm uh feeling confident uh Machi is going to install the rest he's going to right in here but yeah I'll continue tomorrow basically you want to help me Bill it it'ss up you got it right away yes wow so smart you want to build a computer with me oh the fans are all wrong you they need to be on the other side thank you Gane finally I learned how fans work they blow kind of a genius day two feel confident I'm going to finish this today very excited it's going to be a lot of cable management I don't know why I'm standing awkwardly like this camera focus on me I solved my fan mystery I just couldn't understand why like uh I couldn't understand which direction there's an arrow there's an arrow that points [Music] there's an arrow that points the airf flow I was like how can everyone just know so that means I did put these wrong I flipped them now so they are correct or maybe I at this point I don't know maybe I'm overthinking it and then I'm just doing it wrong I I think the next can you focus on me I think the next step is uh power supply I went for a little lower I probably should have gone 800 cuz then if I want to upgrade I don't have to change my power supply but at the same time I don't really care that much and here we go comes with cable ties also these cables are sleeved actually that's kind of nice not all of them I watch videos and I think we're about to enter cable Hell because it's going to be a lot of cables now we have to put a cable from the power supply to power every single unit PCI p8 p8 I have no idea what these things are should I know this the big one is the graphics card I know that goes like that right the other one is probably I have I have no idea well that one only fits there so maybe I should install the fan first uh my first computer that I bought was when I was 18 I think I showed it off in a video or I must have been older than 20 maybe the entire summer I had worked and I saved up around 1,200 and I was going to spend it all on my computer I think this will be mounted like this or should the fan be phasing out that makes sense to me okay power supply screws I feel like I need the big guns that's right this baby ain't going nowhere nice I should probably plug everything in in before I mount it but I don't know what the cables are okay motherboard MB got it CPU is labeled EPS no it's not but it's a 4 plus 4 pin I don't have that graphics card is a six + 2 pin or a 12 + 4 what I have five what I have prettier cables I think I'll use those yeah that'll look good psle e 5.1 God forbid the name the thing what the thing is these might be too short God the cable Madness that this is about to become and I mounted it the wrong way I'm a schmuck alone excuse me [Music] camera okay could actually be higher yeah not convinced about these cables cuz they're quite beefy can't really hide them actually no that works from long these need to go all the way over here no okay it's lunch time be right back finally was time to put in the big boy the GPU but as a dad sometimes the only free time I have it's when the baby's asleep so I built while the baby was asleep therefore I didn't speak so we will just do a montage p is sleeping so I'm just going to work on the computer in silence [Music] I think it looks [Music] okay so I'm going to install the GPU there's the GPU PewDiePie PC Building ASMR I bet you guys didn't expect that this year [Music] [Music] so bit of a problem the GPU is too thick for the not the GPU necessarily the fans are too thick so I can't really use them but then I realized I have these ones that was left over from the the liquid cooler and I'm like I might as well use them right same potato tomato you're not going to see them anyway we'll see how that goes okay new fans are in will it fit please fit oh it fits barely okay it fites it fites nice the only problem I had now is that these don't fit in my how is everything incompatible I thought I'd check that okay I found a cable unfortunately it's an ugly cable so beggers can't be choosers at this point I just want to get this done you don't want to go in do you come on watch me break the GPU snap it enough goodness gracious how fly this is you should go in just go in just go in there we go more cables to organize cool that's actually what I was looking forward to was that it was that the last thing I need to plug in maybe I think that was the last thing to plug in I'm starting to feel like there's just no way this is going to boost there's too many points of failure that I've created [Music] we'll do some quick uh Cable Management I need to make sure the GPU is actually screwed in properly till this little sticker off no I got to screw in the GPU I keep thinking I'm ready but I'm not H maybe it's too tight because I'm thinking maybe the fans of the GPU can't spin I just realized that it's sa too tight I think well I don't know for sure but seems like a risky thing no they're okay ah it fell it fell in the magnetic thing fell in oh it's deep as no no oh I can fish it out all right looks like I'm not finishing today cuz the graphics card is too beefy it's not going to fit in there it's a shame cuz I I thought that one would be really good but I check compatibility that's how it go sometimes so uh I'm going to upt for another one uh but I probably won't I'll do that tomorrow no big deal yeah otherwise I think everything is looking good it's looking clean and I'm looking forward to finally test this tomorrow all right I ran into such a big problem here the GPU sits too low and it touches the fans underneath it so the fans don't spin they not supposed to do this they're supposed to this I spent so much time trying to understand why and Googling it online apparently my motherboard the GPU sits a little lower which makes no sense I kept debating do I switch out the GPU for something else what's the easiest way to fix this in reality I could just skip the fans underneath the gpus has fans it doesn't need fans underneath it necessarily at least I've seen a ton of people online they didn't put the fans underneath but I think it's okay right well anyway as a normal person I switched out the entire motherboard sometimes I wonder there's nothing wrong with me I could have been finished I don't know I just wanted this build to be clean okay I wanted it to be nice I didn't want a Dilly that I didn't want to just skip ahead so it came with a lot of extra effort only to run into more issues now all of the sudden the fans on top are too big for some reason building PC it's not that big in Japan so to order new fans would take a couple days which is so annoying because like I just wanted to finish I also decided to switch out the cooler because I knew I could fit what is it called like a 360 or something instead of a 240 the case could fit it I thought why not that meant that I had to swat swap out the power supply so at this point I have pretty much the godamn son can I just record can I just record there we go this became like a whole ship of thesis meme I pretty much changed out everything except the GPU and the CPU it became a bit silly but I actually really enjoyed it I enjoyed trying to make the most out of this and I think the result was actually worth it [Music] I think it came out super clean not having so much RGB made it look more stylish and I think it fits me better it runs so well now it runs really cool even playing games on high setting I don't even play games that much anymore so I don't even need it I think that I really enjoyed as well was messing with the settings and trying to improve the computer with bios overclocking it tweaking to make it boot faster this is really fun I enjoy doing that I totally see why people enjoy building PCS I love doing it now I can finally call myself a gamer",unknown
nrzrkiu5nyI,[Music] no no no take it out that's what you want to do double jump here come on my gamer to protect good you got it you got it yes you got it almost there are you excited the seats are

a short-term long-term ho it's like worth it what does that even mean it's just worth it so you're saying even though your life is never going to be the same again you're saying it's worth it even though the cost of daycare is just another mortgage payment it's still worth it totally worth it even though you're losing track of the days and your sleep schedule is broken Beyond repair to a point where you can't decipher between dreams and reality you still think it's worth it though you're gambling on a spectrum between raising the next president United States or Menendez brother you still

day today uh I'm going to the police it's really interesting It's So Different Here J with me you can't just uh buy a car here I need like proof that you have somewhere to park it so I had to draw like a map of my parking I don't really get it I'm not going to lie I don't get why I have to do it and then I need an uh Incan sh which is like a proof of my stamp you know we have the just signature which I don't think makes any sense either just a signature like anyone can fake that but I have the stamp but I need like a document for the stamp that is issued from a card I'm just so confused by it then once I all that I can submit that to then buy the car he it can y i uh take it back it makes sense actually I remember as a kid when we first needed our parent signature in first grade I was like but anyone can write that but they were like yeah but you shouldn't I'm like but did so here in Japan they have a system where it validates so this is my my signature right but then I need a document from the government that says this is his signature so they accompany each other makes it makes sense it's kind of a lot of a lot of effort but I I get it today we've been busy be this is the police masket it's so cute so every so many companies have it but every big department in Japan has a masket and then uh I brought be to the post office and this is the post office masket which is which is a bear and they gave they gifted all this they're so nice you bring beer and everyone's so nice that's so cute VN has found his new ride looking cool oh wow oh yes so excited we're inaro

yfQAnBol6Jw,you guys know what this is It's a nose Swizzle check this [Applause] out sorry it was in the background it distracted me book review I can't clap cuz it will sound horrible at last book review will return last year I uploaded a video I bet you didn't watch it so I'm giving you a second chance I want to help you guys out it's was talking about habits how to take bad habits and replace them with good ones I know this seems like some sort of U productivity idity 2025 Sigma bigma I was trying to be go beyond that and use ideas from philosophy to incorporate these ideas and for me it really worked I picked up drawing I've been sketching every day since but that's just one of many things that I I think at least I've learned from reading reading is something that I enjoyed as a kid something I had also abandoned kind of like drawing actually something I enjoyed as a kid but then I picked it up again and realized just how much I loved it and uh it was the best thing I've ever done for myself by far reading completely changed my whole perspective in life I think it's just something incredibly valuable that I think everyone should experience and that's why I've announced book review 2025 cuz I want you guys to have the same Journey or if not Inspire to go on your own all these books that we're going to read I've already read but I will re read them with you I don't want to blame having a kid but I have not read nearly as much as I used to this past couple years and I want to get back into it as well so I can't make any excuses therefore you can't make any excuses now I haven't really figured out how I'm going to do this but I realize the best way to make anyone do anything is through shame therefore we will have have a shame list for anyone that fails book review 2025 and also everyone that do complete book review 2025 will get a sense of ah beyond the infinite wisdom also a sense of ah now let's get into the books the book list in January we're going to start off we're going to work our way this way we're going to start off super simple baby level T teing this is ancient Chinese wisdom it's only 100 pages but you could very easily finish it in a in one day but we're not supposed to do that we're going to take our time with it hey you can do whatever you want who cares it's hard to hold a book and a microphone the reason I H picked this book is because it's a really good soft start if for Rusty readers out there I think it's very simple it breaks down ancient wisdom in a nice simple way I kept seeing simple as you see I I've labored things in this because I think there are some passages that are just brilliant and that I keep coming back to that's sort of a theme throughout all these books that I've picked is it's books that really resonated with me I've learned stuff from them that I've Incorporated in my life and that I like to revisit and rethink about and remind myself and I think u t teing is just a great start of that and if you want to do a head start maybe let's say you finished this and you're like okay I want to move on obviously you can do that sorry to interrupt I actually wanted to review a book really quickly it's one that speaks highly to my heart and my Soul it's the book of the best vpn's on the planet starting n VPN only have you guys heard about this have you heard about nordvpn this book

I'm happy to sponsor products that I actually use myself so thank you nordvpn check out nordvpn.com PewDiePie the link is the description let's continue with the book reviews the second book is in in the Buddhist words I've talked about this book so much because it's an incredible book we S I hate using the word Awakening for lack of better one that's all I'm going to use because it really was an Awakening experience for me to read this book I never examined myself in in such a way and it's funny the book seems almost aware of this itself where most of us throughout our lives go through our days and it maybe in our entire existence for many existences as Buddhism believes where we're drawn to Sensational Pleasures we're drawn to all these distractions without fully examining our lives and and our purpose and what we're doing and when you read it you get that understanding and you look at yourself obviously first you look at yourself but then you look at the whole world and you realize you want everyone to sort of stop and go no wait let's what are we doing here let's rethink this uh what is our purpose come on to me there's just something so tragic about living your life without examining it it taught me so much about Sensational pleasure especially I'm Mr dopamine okay I'm sure a lot of people can relate to this but there's almost this romanticized idea of of a sad man at a bar hunched over with a drink like there's something cool about it smoking a cigar these things are not cool that's sad all of that is sad and not a sad in that wow so sad kind of way just bad don't romanticize these things you know what I mean being drawn these Sensational Pleasures you can Free Yourself completely from them I'm speaking way more about this than I thought I would but here we are you just binding yourself to different things that you don't need and by uprooting these uh issues they will you'll completely be free from them I used to think about drinking alcohol every single day now it has zero control over me there's so much in Buddhism that ties into what we're going to go into later as well but moving on January February March March you can pick whatever you want I I think every third month I will let you guys decide I think the point of reading is not just to blindly follow what someone laid in front of you it's about finding your own Curiosities okay you read this huh I'm interested in maybe expanding on this or do reading something different maybe I hated it and this is not for me that's part of the your own Discovery I will announce which books I will read but I see them sort of outside of the list they might be maybe too advanced for some of you sounds so demeaning like you you dummies I'm going to read maybe I'll do uh uh meditations of first Philosophy by Renee Descartes I never read Renee there's a couple philosophers that I just never touched and I want to I I just feel like I should read them so that's what I pick for March moving on with the book list January February March April I don't know the months unless I count them in order another book I've talked about so much we're going to read epic Titus discourses and selected writings if you for some reason haven't read this with the amount of yapping I've done about this book you got to do it now I think if I had to pick one book out of all of these one book to rule the moral I would pick the inidian literally means handbook it is the handbook of stoicism it is the simplest way to ever explain stoicism people mostly associate stoicism with Marcus aurelus or maybe senica and aurelus obviously is an incredible story I think his life is more interesting and obviously he talks about stoicism which is amazing and he lived sism which is amazing but uh just take the inidian it puts it so beautifully and so simply and I think everyone can benefit from these ideas they are similar to Buddhism in the sense of it's in a way of avoiding suffering I've been very fortunate and and privileged I there hasn't been much times where I even feel like I need stoicism but reading stoicism it almost feels like I I put on this armor like I'm ready for anything whatever life is going to give me I'll be ready for it and that's how stoicism changes your perspective instead of fearing Misfortune you you sort of look at it as this gives me a chance to show show my virtue and and what I've learned I remember there was a book I read about American soldier that crashed his plane over Vietnam during the war and he had started sism and as he was shut down and falling in his parachute he he thought to himself this is my chance to practice what I've learned from stoicism because he knew how they would torture soldiers and uh they did okay I'm going to have to speed up cuz be is going to na soon next up we have hey play to The Republic oh oh if you think I've yed a lot about epic tittis I've actually realized I Y way more about play The Republic I I love I made a 40-minute video talking about this book I love it so much I think it is also really good introduction to philosophy because it covers so so many areas the whole premise of the book is uh Socrates is discussing with Glon they're trying to find the definition of justice since it's something that they're trying to discover together it makes you feel part of this philosophical discussion like you're transported into this uh the same room as as the greatest mind of all time and you get to experience and join this discussion what other medium could do that but literature it's just so incredible I feel so fortunate to even be reading this book it examines the human soul but then goes into a macro level and they try and examine okay so to answer this question we need to examine what is the ideal way of running a society yeah it goes into all these amazing and interesting ideas some are a little bit weird actually now I think about it I feel like I shouldn't say I enjoy this book too much big disclaimer I do not agree with every single idea that this author has a necessary 2019 disclosure everyone and then in the end it ties it all together in this beautiful like depiction of the afterlife and and rebirth kind of like Buddhism as well and what sort of Life they want to live and it answers that question in the end and I just think about it all the time I absolutely love it it's an an amazing book I'm just so excited for you for you guys defitely H anyway third month free I'm going to read I'm going to read content critique of pure reason I feel like I have to recount I tried a while ago I think I got a third in and uh I stopped for whatever reason it is extremely dense literature like uh I do not necessarily recommend casual readers to pick this one up I uh read a bit about Kant and I find him to be more interesting than his work he was just Mega autistic he's basically Sheldon Cooper which makes for a lot of interesting and sort of silly things about his life he had the famous philosopher walk every day at the exact same time but he refused to speak to anyone so if anyone tried to he would Resort he didn't want his lips to open cuz that would constitute us talking so he would resort to making noises with his mouth like mhm it's just I don't know it's funny to me I obviously know some ideas around him and his moral principles are quite famous I'm curious to read if his reasoning can sort of bring me over or not I don't know interjecting I done a little bit more research about the books that I picked cuz obviously I haven't read them and I think it might be a little difficult to do K in just a month so I was thinking okay maybe I'll do two much and or maybe I'll I was trying to think the best way to do it but then I thought you know what I'm just going to try my best if I fail that's okay I can I can pick it up at some other time or or keep going so I'm just saying this if you're deciding to read the same book which I don't encourage to be honest but if you are to be honest I I want you guys to pick your own interest uh but yeah just wanted to explain my reasoning right so next up guess what another book I've talked about a ton Aristotle nikan ethics that sounds so Advanced but it's really simple do not be turned turned off from this it is talking about happiness how to be happy what what does it mean to be a good person uh the Greek had this word for happiness which is a beautiful word called udonia and it sort of translates vaguely to flourishing as an individual and this is something I think about a lot and I can sort of make sense out of it I used this book a lot my previous video that I talked about last year about the ideas of habit cuz the Greeks understood habit and how it can lead to good virtues while bad habit obviously leads to bad virtues and but it's not just about becoming this imulation I almost Ed the tough word there but I I gave up amalgamation sort of this new Millennial idea of how you should be the more you achieve the more you show people that you're doing that is not the answer if anything that just leads to another attachment but Aristotle talk about the golden mean and this sort of balance instead of your life I'm looking forward to refresh my ideas on it I think it's just incredibly incredibly useful and valuable for people to read next is more for me you don't have to read this I I'll say you have to read a classic uh I think so many people don't want to read classic literature but that is just a huge mistake I can never say it right donkey shot the cter mon the crystal Moby Dick actually I don't I wasn't huge M day I read cash 22 recently too which is another classic I just think that was hilarious I love it actually but a classic literature maybe seems a bit dull but they are classic for a reason every time I read one it's just an amazing experience and my favorite I I don't know if it even counts as a classic but my favorite is The Iliad I love the ilad so much I've had such a weird experience with it because uh when I was a kid I think around 11 or 12 I was so into the Troy War history I don't know why I think I read it about it somewhere like a Comic version and I wanted to know everything there was about it how tall were the walls and I wanted to remember all the years and then you find out about things that you know may or may not have happened you know with the Achilles fighting Hector and all these things I just thought it was so cool I couldn't believe not everyone was talking about it and I thought it was the coolest thing ever it was basically my Marvel of the time you know I was like the gods are helping all in all these battles that's the coolest thing ever and then finally in my 30s I read the actual Iliad and I thought the gods are helping in the war that's the coolest thing ever I I I absolutely love it most people know the Iliad or associate The Iliad with the troyan horse everyone knows about it but surprisingly it isn't in The Iliad and the Iliad ends completely differently and to me the ending of Iliad was so beautiful it really struck me deeply I remember when I read it and I think most Classics do they really just hit you differently I don't know how to explain it yeah I just thought it was so incredible and I I love reading it and I want to reread it so uh that's why I picked it but I just encouraged maybe picking a a classic that you're interested in it will be worth it so next month it's free you can read whatever you want I will read Arthur schopenhauer I think actually you can read it as well it sort of makes sense to read before nche I will read the world as will and representation I think I've already read it but I think I definitely need a refresher chaen was the first as far as I understand the Western uh Buddhist he wanted to escape suffering and N which will read later really looked up to shophow but also critiqued him heavily and I want to sort of better understand schopenhauer and why cuz I I don't remember much I don't even have the copy here I left it in UK so I look forward to read open hour and then we have October I know like I'm the one who made the least so obviously I'm going to like all the books but I'm like this is so sick I love this all right so next up we're going to go into n thus so spoke sarra I talked about this book in the video I made last year a little bit there are these ideas of Will To Power the Uber MCH uh you you heard God is dead this is all in this book sarra n is such a interesting character he is the most misunderstood philosopher by far and even amongst people that have a better idea of n everyone seems to disagree as well but I I understand I understand n okay I got it I don't all these books that we read by the way so far not all of them but most of the philosophers n has up he hat he hated everyone he had this hit hit list of philosophers and he would attack them all the time it's kind of funny but I also saw it as a you know you criticize things that you like in a sense as much as I love sism and we will understand sism once we got to nche he did criticize stoicism and I think his criticism is actually fair you know nche is famously misunderstood as the poster boy for nihilism when in reality as you probably know now is he fought for the opposite he thought about this life his life affirming philosophy to me I think is so important I don't remember if s sistra had that much of that idea in it actually I think it's more in the gay science I know it's a hilarious title of a book I still think sister if I had to pick one each it's it's a really good one to start on well I don't know it's a really good one to pick apparently I don't know if it's true I think it is he was high on opioids when he wrote it so it is vastly different from other books I read from him but that also makes it very fun I think it's really fun to read and I can't wait for you guys to experience it as well like all of these books next up we have we're going to finish with sidara by Heron has maybe it doesn't make sense to end on this maybe it does make sense to end on this I think I'll know once I read reread it it is the the story of Buddha there are different depictions of Buddha amongst Buddhism but the more modern version as far as I understand is that he was a person that lived went through difficulties and suffering just as we did but then overcame it and became enlightened and became the Buddha and that is the story of suhara so I think it's a beautiful beautiful book that I would highly recommend to anyone it really surprised me caught me out of nowhere I had this horrible version of it from Amazon doesn't even have a proper spine uh if anyone have a better version if you want to give it to me I would love it and then finally you're free December I'm going to read phenomenology of Spirit by hego cuz I never read hego and I feel like I should he just have such a boring face I just assume he is equally boring I think any of these FL K looks boring yeah I'll say it if he has a dumb face probably his ideas are dumb too it's like I learned nothing from all this that is the 2025 book review imagine if you all you have to do is spend let's say the average of these book are 300 Pages they are probably a little bit more but probably more or less if you read 20 Pages a day for 30 days 2 minutes per page probably less maybe you know instead of going on your phone the first thing in the morning or um before bed replace that with the reading and it will have no change in your productivity or what you're doing but it will just vastly improve your life and I guarantee it rep a bad habit with a good one let's do it I'm so excited for you guys I'm so excited for me this is going to be great that's it hug come here,unknown

8fLZQYiI3mg,"can guess how many podcasts there is in the world I listen to two too many that's what it is too many yes everyone has a podcast K true there's a 3.2 million podcasts in case anyone is wondering what no no way yeah 3.2 million podcast there's 3.2 million podcasts I told you too many podcasts your grandma's got a podcast your janitor's got a podcast janitor talk with Grandma every Niche every in every interest you can think of podcast and it leads to uh Beautiful Moments uh like this one K in this world literally lives once like you've only got one opportunity in this world I think that you know what I'm saying like you've only got one opportunity as soon as you're off this planet you're off like every single day take it as it comes like just literally literally Ken you get one life it's not like video game you could just get another life M believe this K literally literally you die if you die you die it's like game over it doesn't even say game I bet it doesn't even do that afterwards oh that's what I was thinking right there that comment boys discovering YOLO everyone has this microphone as well like there's a bunch of boys buying sure microphones but like literally we're a podcast now we now have a podcast literally literally people listen to us seem like the concept of podcast on a production value level is like let's go sit in a very comfortable looking room mhm and across from each other with multiple cameras cuz you got to have camera angles yeah and let's talk about life you know wear your expensive watches and have your Gucci bag out or whatever that is and and discover the obvious things in life like that if you die that you're dead forever well it keeps going actually I still believe there's an afterlife though boys I could shut about this for ages going to goon Heaven goon reveal if if there's a heaven these boys will we go into it 100% VIP passes don't you know who they are they have a podcast let them in all right that's the line for normal people oh you got a podcast you got this line we got you fast track don't worry about it tuon taton tuon J fuel has a taton a weak long event for you for me for fellow drinkers of

drink it every single day it keeps me fresh keeps me energized keeps me going making videos I would not be here without gfuel let's get real this is funny cuz like clearly people aren't that interesting not everyone is interesting enough to have a podcast that's true I think probably no one is that interesting to have a podcast now I mention it uh but now you know podcast is becoming more of a it's affecting Society politics I don't know if you saw the man went on Joe Rogan oh yeah yeah and this got 51 million views Jesus crazy I assume you didn't watch it no no I didn't it's funny to me because uh the other one Kamala uh she had a podcast as well she's like oh you went Joe Rogan well I'm going to go on the feminine podcast and it it didn't even break a million a call her daddy nice yeah yeah that's the biggest uh F of broadcast apparently didn't break a didn't break a million how the did that happen yeah yeah well apparently I don't know if this is true but apparently she didn't want to go to her set so they rebuild a set where she yeah did you heard about this I heard this yeah I don't know if it's true but it apparently it cost 100,000 to build this they had to rebuild a set yeah and they didn't even break a a million how does it cost 100,000 to build this what come on some someone was like oh yeah I can do that it's going to cuss you know oh man boy it's going to go the say though she's running for president well well well that table right there usually 100 bucks but for you 10,000 golden chairs off Amazon usually 25 bucks no no no 2,500 at least can they just done a different Studio I don't know why this bothers me so much it's it's too much it's like why really just the studio is not the selling point they didn't need to recreate the studio no they did not need to do that it's hilarious uh going back on Joe Joey Joe I don't know if you ever listened to him Have you listened to Joe Rogan I I liot at the beginning this I don't listen to any podcasts at all I have no horse in this race I had this uh Epiphany I'm like oh he's like the biggest podcast I never actually listened to him so I listened to an episode I'm like oh he's actually respectfully very dumb so there's this compilation of him not under he's a comedian but there's a compilation of him not understanding jokes and is really funny Joe you were great on friends I wasn't on friends that's a [Music] joke my favorite one is uh this clip he's talking about the wigs that they used to wear like those white eloquent little wigs back in there yeah Court used to wear oh yeah yeah that all came from a pair of Rich Noble where where were they again in France wiggers I think they called them no wiggers are white people that wish they were black it's the aliens are thank you for explaining that's a different thing incredible see this is a lot where he communist will make a joke and he'll just be like no that's wrong funny that is factually incorrect sir how could you he I guess it's obvious cuz like he brings in a lot of people that are smart and I think that's why his podcast is uh uh interesting yeah it's very guest based right like you have a like a high high class guests and you get the views yeah it's clearly working for him but it's it also shows just how dumb he is I saw some like meme where it kind of just showed him as a caveman and then he bring in like a scientist be like you explain explain fire now explain how he works and that's kind of it summarized but yeah I just thought it was funny I think the whole concept of podcast pods now is interesting because you know podcasts they're audio so you're just listening to the audio but they're like so video based now yeah they're all video now yeah yeah it's not we were ahead of our time keep calling you yes this is me your child I call Edgar be too yeah they it's almost like they've replaced I don't know it's like YouTube's replacing television but then there's like a spot for like news and interviews and like journalism it almost kind of feels like podcasts have yeah maybe it's just the new version of radio maybe that's what it is I'm trying trying to say you're sounding like these idiots now Ken what are you ruining this whole thing oh sorry I just think it's weird actually Ed podcast are replacing radio no yeah but I mean that's the audio but now it's video oh that's that's the part that's so weird to me because like even what we're doing right now making this video for YouTube if we just did it for an hour and a half it would be a podcast yeah there's no what's the difference why called a podcast there's literally no difference yeah that's a good point I do think sorry that's what I was trying to get to it took me too long I I clowned on you I'm sorry I'm sorry here's another example of oversaturated sh with podcast my married friends told me that when you get married your husband or your wife or whoever you're marrying when you get married your partner actually becomes your immediate family holy no waen is that why you Chang names as well or is that just like I thought it was just a random coincidence she's explaining it like oh my god did you know yeah it's almost like your mom and your dad or your family you know crazy you're right it's the way she delivers it that makes it so good guys a friend told me this you're it's you're not going to believe it I kind of enjoy becoming an old man especially old man content creator because you get to see all the the up and coming youngans making their videos and making all the same mistakes that everyone else has already made but then they have epiphanies like this and they're like I need to record this I need to post this on everything and you're just like yes go right ahead yes tell me about family I love my mom I want her to come I don't know if this is weird to say but but I want my mom to have Flawless experiences like I want you to have that and I want you to have I'm just a all right let's W back in history real quick Felix on the broken podcast you know we're sitting there I never said anything like that what the Felix Felix I really I just want you to have a satisfying sexual experiences I want you to come buckets I just want you to SP your load massive amounts as much as you possibly can I want that for you buddy because I love you H that's love right there thanks bro I hope you come buckets next time bro [Â __Â ] no all of this reminds me of uh this clip that I I remember from a TV show called uh Nathan for you I think it's called have you seen that show no I don't think so it's the best show ever it's seriously it's so funny this guy is always in character no matter what I never ever seen a br character but I think this is as close as i' ever seen a character cuz someone out weirds him and I don't know if it's intentional or enough it reminds me of the podcast of people saying wouldn't redeem the rebate right but really in the end what i realiz is that more important than any of this is friendship oh that's right and doing this I made some very good friends Ray primis was one of them who R primis oh he was willing to drink pee pee yeah really who's pee no just anyone's pee anyone's pee he says there's no germs oh maybe they can drink my grandson's PE is very clean huh yeah sorry what why because it's clean why PR my PE or your pee promoting your grandson's pee I am promoting because grandson's pee sometimes helps it's it's is really help have you heard about this you drank no why I was scared what do you mean you were scared yeah sometimes you're scared for for something what you talking about accident or something you drink the grandson's pee and it's going to help you ah okay I don't understand why does it help you if you drink your grandson's pee that's what they say who says that my grandma your grandma time ago yeah you drink your grandson's tea if you get scared not grandsons any little kid any little kid okay over age of five because before over age of five it's it's oh it's terrible that oh it's no good after that I'm serious about it but why yeah if you're scared yeah you're scared Ken just drink your grandson's PE somebody get Chris Hans on the phone I don't know what's going on here hold on a second this is like the podcast thing where like people if you give them enough time to talk they'll say like this and it's like no I don't want to hear about it this one was funny though this summarizes It For Me Jesus there's even like that the early 2000s humor that like the people who just try to say too much to make people uncomfortable for a laugh I hate that okay well I think he's being genuine and that's why this is so you think it's being genuine yeah yes is just drink your grandson's pee what's the problem K I don't know I can think of a few but if you're scared only if you're scared only if you're scared right oh there's something under my bed does that mean he keeps it you know what I don't want to think about it I don't I thought he's about to turn around and pick some up the way he did that but then got a picture and I was like okay once a we I found this clip of KSI sharing the fact that he doesn't shower which is also just one of those like no no no hear me out no no shut up Vic I don't like showering I think it's it's just boring do you like baths no put music on in the shower no but like the idea of having to clean myself every time like every day bro I literally train what twice a day every day and I have show twice God I I four or five times a day but it's just outrageous wait so he showers once a week it's like if you just didn't have a podcast no one would know about it just don't just don't talk about it I'm just thinking about like the like the the reality of the situation so is he just like sitting around stinking all the time I he must clearly if he works out twice day but but since he's KSI and everyone like you know around him is just like yeah man yes cool yeah oh man I can't wait half oh no no half five Slow Five yeah what's your protocol on telling people if they stink cuz mine is I I 100% have every right to tell them but I understand Society doesn't allow me to tell people have you not had this problem before oh yeah yeah I mean everyone's had the problem where like someone just got some some bad BOS and that body odor going on you know you're like I'm probably weirdly self-conscious about if I smell like it's always in the back of my mind like if I can tell that something smells um I get super paranoid and I think oh is it me what did I do is it me and then I I want to get it out in the open so it's not just weird for the other person cuz sometimes you happen to smell and it happens for whatever reason okay I'm not like Ki I shower okay but sometimes you smell and I rather be it out there be like okay H sorry I think I smell a little bit whoopsie but then what happened what I realized afterwards is like I come back home I asked my say like do I smell and she's like no and like that they're the ones that smell and I made a point to say that I smell and they just accepted it that was their chance to be like no I think it's me but they said nothing how can they do this and they do the Betrayal they let you take all the blame they knew they stunk they knew cuz I I watch videos about people's how to tell people that they smell and the person they always say the experts I've reached the experts and they said they know they out so there's no point in telling that I wonder I always wonder if it's kind of like you know when you go to the toilet and you got to take a massive slam right and M you know of course it's stin it stinks in there but you don't really notice it because you're the one that's just sitting in it and you know you kind of oh I know oh I know but then you leave and you come like you know are you going when someone else is just finished and you're like oh it like hits you a lot harder I wonder if that's the same thing for like body odor if they're like that's a good point now this is the kind of discussions that truly should be discussed on podcast can yes yes yes when you out we're fancy right now yes no I think everyone else's poop just smells worse it's just cuz it's not yours you know if it was yours it'd be different okay I have a follow-up question Ken okay CU we're on the podcast trailer what's your protocol on pooping on some in someone else's house cuz to me it's 100% legal yeah I mean if you got to poop you got to poop that's you got to you got to poop exactly it's natural you got to do it if I want people I want to cultivate a safe space in my home where people feel comfortable to poop in my house but I I can tell they hold it in sometimes and I'm like why did you do that just let it rip it's that poop anxiety you know go in there and blow it up you know but you have some manners still though when you go in there you know you poop you go you give it some extra flushes you know you don't let it just sit in the water and just stink up the whole house you know you goe flush as you go of course of course yeah yeah yeah you got to do that the same people that won't poop in your house are the ones that like will never use public restrooms either but old men old men don't care use the public restroom and that old dude sits next to you and he can like look down you see his like his all black like shoes that he's been wearing for like 80 years and he he'll blow you out of the whole bathroom just like no care in the world and you're over there trying to be quiet certain dominance in the bathroom I it's funny how you said like old men don't care cuz I definitely used to be self-conscious about it where it's like I I will put a little bit of paper before so you don't hear the splash now it's just like uh it's a bonding thing you want to make as much noise as possible so we all feel safe together it's like this I I make extra grunts just so everyone else feels safe even hit the wall and the give it a grunt you know and yeah yeah yeah you both do it in unison that that gives everyone else is having the anxiety the the confidence to poop healthily get it out yes we're saving lives out here man it's not good to hold it in so anyway Ki doesn't shower apparently thanks for that info so go back on podcast again you've probably seen there's also been like a Resurgence or not Resurgence but emergence of alpha male podcast I just never addressed them so I try to I try to look up like okay what do they actually talk about this is where you go for to lose brain cells but okay yeah yeah let's see it how many microphones do you need Jesus Christ everyone needs their own they have their own audio tracks and everything so they can they can balance and everything yeah this guy asked uh people to rate him and he just couldn't take he couldn't take the answer we're rating just off physical appearance just off Beauty okay same standards we trust me we're not going to get hurt okay what about you over there go she rated him a two two two I would give him a nine okay what is what is she over there I would give him a 10 cuz he invited me all right so again you sound like a stupid ass I'm trying to figure out why you rated me a two because you're not we're not going off our interactions we're going off Beauty I don't like like I don't give a he's light-skinned just like me and you just gave him a nine you gave me a two an gave me a two because of the whole interaction that we've been having right so do me a favor get the up and get the out thank you yeah get out our feelings will not get hurt D get the [Â __Â ] out of get out what a child dude if you're by into the alpha Mel concept to begin with you already have a fragile ego to start out with so it's just kind of expected I forget that these people exist it's so weird to me like I'm so far away from it that when I watch it I'm like wo they sound like 12-year-olds it's crazy it's like how do they have all these women on the podcast to begin with like what I don't know how that happened I think the microphone and the whole studio thing is like part of it like yes it's a real podcast that real people listen to for sure well I can already tell they don't know what they're doing because they have the sound dampening phone all over every wall in here like the cheap stuff from Amazon it's all over the place that's like new move number one you see anybody that all over the place you already know that they either you're doing it for the looks or you have no idea what you're doing it's soundproofing no you wouldn't do it like that it's just that everyone did it for a while I'm like I guess this is how you do it yeah even even early on I did it too and then I learned it's like oh there's actually like a science to this you don't just supposed to put on your entire wall the only Alpha thing that the the young men out there need to know is that girl men don't need to identify with being an alph you grow man you do what you want be a man who cares other people think about Sigma advice from cinnamon toast canid Sigma Sigma how many of these Sigma strong gu so cool bring women on podcast be rude to them cuz so epic how who's listening to this I don't get it and and they're like a demographic for that is like young impressionable men mostly or boys this more even more embarrassing if that's the case all right well that's all I got to share podcast I've gone too far thank you I've been enlightened I've have even more reasons not to listen or watch any podc now thank you which is why we're announcing that we are [Music] doing no going to end it there you know what sucks connecting to the internet without a VPN use nordvpn no one gued that one I've been using nordvpn for years now as an amazing service and I'm proudly sponsored by them with one quick click a ro and Bam I'm connected see but nor VPN is more

GPLImB-I71w,I drew every day for a year What's the progress was it worth it so this all started as a random idea I wanted to make a progression video and I picked art because I thought it was easy to track like I'll draw for 30 days I can show the first day and then I can compare to the last day that'll be interesting to see did I make progress people were so encouraging on the video and I really enjoyed picking up drawing so I kept going and I did 100 day one and people enjoyed it even more there was no way I was going to stop I had to do at least a year and here we are being here I have so many emotions I am happy all right let's dig into it let's watch sorry my nails this is where it all started 365 days ago day one that a self-portrait what up yes yes man this is nice to watch like okay some are not terrible this gives me this gives me uh confidence here's when I started to look up tutorials and stuff online you think it'd be better but they all kind of look like they have some sort of allergy like they uh they ate a lobster and they have a seafood allergy the chin is very big I probably would have made it something more like wonder if I can fix this I feel bad for Future Past St damn I drew so hard I can't erase damn such a simple ch change and it's already so much better I realize and maybe other people have said this to but drawing is more about training your brain to see rather than actually technical with your hand I think that's a misconception I had but after 30 days this was the progress of my first video I was so happy with it and I think and yeah I think I should be cuz the progress is definitely there so this is my progress after 82 days 84 and I really think here's where I peaked in terms of if you wanted to just improve as much as possible in the shortest time I think just adding colors on papers it's so satisfying to look at that it kind of forgives a lot of the anatomy errors the POR Line work the sketch is still being there like it's just nice to look at regardless but yeah this is the last thing I drew for my 100 day video and yeah it's it's cute I did it I drew something so let's check the progress from there on that's [Music] wrong first of all don't do what I did I just kept drawing the same things anime girl anime girl too much anime just bad bad just bad I was trying to be Technical and like give myself notes so I can improve I wanted to be more consistent I think that's why I kept doing this but if I had to read do it absolutely not this is where I should have moved on to something else I should have just drawn anything else and eventually I did I really wanted to draw more color but it takes so much time to do that and I really felt like I needed mileage more than anything so just adding a little bit of color sure we'll ink it but that's that's the most effort I'm going to get into yeah just sketching random stuff I find online finally finally I move on and I draw boys this is the boys Arc I drew so much uh guys from anime because I thought I drew so many mangas you probably recognize these I think this is jiis kaen I think you know this is a good time for me to address a couple things from my last video and uh one of them is just a huge thanks to other YouTubers that reacted to my video I think that was so cool to see and actually get encouraged by professionals I really really appreciated that another thing was that people said I had an art background that was like a rumor that went around and I guess I take that as compliment but no I do not I I have not started art that was the whole point of this video I was not being disingenuous I have not drawn since I was a kid but I loved doing Photoshop before YouTube I loved photoshopping images uh and creating artworks that way so maybe in a sense that helped but I think the biggest sort of thing that helped is that I'm actually older like I'm 35 now and I think if I did this thing when I was younger I would not have seen the same Improvement but I also think you know the Improvement I had anyone can achieve like I wanted my video to be inspiring for other people to do the same thing like that's my goal like people say anyone can draw and I truly truly believe that oh and by the way I wrote a blog post yes I write blog post now it's just more details about my favorite type of notebooks my favorite kind of pens if I were to do this challenge again what would I do differently how to remain consistent all these sort of stuff if you wanted to do this challenge yourself I recommend checking that out I just didn't want to get too much detail in this video uh but an insecurity of mine was brewing which was I couldn't like if I wanted to draw anime style sorry it's hard to see here you start with a sharkle you draw a middle line you draw where the eyes are going to be you kind of figure out how the chin is going to be the nose the mouth the [Music] ear and then you spirling some hair really quick uh this method is so helpful because when you draw it's all about balance like if I drew directly same thing and anything is like out of proportion the whole thing just kind of looks weird so to draw directly it was so difficult so I bought this pen this pen is amazing it's a brush pen and if you squeeze it ink comes out and you can draw really Slim lines or really thick lines really really quickly and I told myself I was going to force myself to use this pen even though it looks like I was going to really like I'm going to use this pen I need to learn how to draw without without the whole circle thing again at least that's what I wanted to do and it took some time it felt like taking a 100 steps back but uh that's how you have to improve you know you have to get out of your comfort zone but I think eventually I started to sort of get the hang of it and you can get kind of really quickly uh satisfying result with the high contrast I really really enjoyed uh so I did did some manga panels and yeah it feels like I'm looking at a manga it's really cool getting more comfortable it's still so hard with proportions man like anything is slightly off it's going to suck so yeah this felt like a little side quest but I'm glad I took it and uh yeah it was really fun but what I should have been doing is draw other things as well I did find it amazing like how I could all of a sudden even though I never practiced drawing a cloud I could draw a cloud better than I ever could so that's cool okay I'm done but I think something finally sparked in me where before I was like okay I just want to draw for the sake of drawing I don't have any interest in anything I started drawing manga panels I started drawing perspective and I wanted to understand these things drawing Landscapes this is nii I love his work so much so finally finally after I don't know 300 days of drawing I picked up an art book I should have done this ages ago so I picked up a couple art books some more technical than others but I really enjoyed this one taco because I enjoyed the style of it obviously everyone has different preferences I think if you were to be a professional artist you probably want to pick like a human anatomy book and really study it but for me it's is supposed to be fun and I think if I am having fun I will remain consistent so at least that's what I was trying to focus on I picked up books about perspective cuz I I want to learn and I want to understand this and I think finally that clicked in me it went from me just wanting to sketch whatever to no I actually want to understand these things so I can draw them better and I wish I did that sooner again this felt like taking so many steps back because I had no clue how to draw a body zero I had not practiced it at all I have sketched so much and I still I it feels embarrassing to admit this but like everyone was so amazed by my 100 one that I felt like okay well my year one has to be really good right like but progress isn't a straight line like I think I was being too hard on myself where I was getting close to a year and I'm like I don't I don't have anything to show for it I H drew a full body one and I'm like comparing it to my 80 day one and I'm like the 80 one it's still better even though this is like full body it's so bad so if you want to improve you have to kind of go through the pain of sucking again I guess guess it's it really felt like oh cool like I drew for this much and all I I don't have anything to show for it I think I wanted to learn to draw and actually understand Anatomy before uh it didn't matter to me it was just a hobby but now I'm like I want to actually know like how do you draw legs how do you draw different Expressions uh how do you draw what is this you've all been waiting for the return of what is it Yu slies back G fuel Energy Formula PewDiePie Yu flavor Japanese lemon delicious is back along with fearfest where you can get ghostfest stab stimulant caramel apple and Halloween edition water melon lad L lad you can pre-order the usess slime PewDiePie collector's box now get it now now's your chance but you can get the the energy tub right away but it's a limited time only a lot of people are requested for the return of the user slash it's delicious I love drinking G fuel it's a great way to support the channel I I really really appreciate it if you guys can check it out link is in the description I I was genuinely panicking like it's so it's been so frustrated this entire month not only because I wanted to show for the video but I I felt genuinely in me like I can do more I know I can do more I know I can do better and I really wanted that to show so I really did push myself a lot towards the end here and that's when I bought an iPad coming in clutch last minute super satisfying to draw with a pen on an iPad but obviously it was way different so again it was like a last minute learning curve of me not understanding the program and yada yada yada so let's go through the last thing I drew which was on the iPad so I started off just sketching and I was still too scared to draw buddies I drew this which I thought was going to be amazing and I ended up really hating it I think the F colors are fun but I didn't know how to draw hair I at least try to draw like a full body but I was so scared of getting it wrong that I think I just made it look weird so I practiced drawing hair but it's just like nothing interesting about it this is just to try it out and then I thought okay I'm going to really wow you guys I started the line work I tried my best to draw the actual hands this is going to be so good and this is the end result and I genuinely hate looking at it I've looked at it so much it just pisses me off even now I don't I don't want even in my head it was going to be so much more you know and then you look at it and you're like oh cool that was it huh I desperately try to draw something else cuz I I don't know like I I felt like I could do more but I kept drawing and I couldn't like it just came out looking weird and unsatisfying this was supposed to be like the most simplest thing ever like black high contrast with some color still I didn't like it and I was getting so close to the deadline I think I have like 20 days left until this video I drew a full body with perspective and uh I thought it came out pretty good I was okay with this one but I still felt like I could do more so I sketched for a couple days and I told myself I'm going to get one last effort I have to really like it to actually sketch it and this is the last thing I drew I finished it yesterday and I think I'm finally happy with it I finally Drew clothes that isn't just black and uh I actually put some more time into the hair and like making the lines look nice and uh small little details and having the high contrast light maybe it's wrong but it's there at least and I think it makes it more interesting you know with some shadows and different poles you know all of it I think I'm uh I'm happy with it I think for a year progress yeah am I allowed to be happy it took a lot of pain to get there you know like uh let's compare day one day [Music] 365 I don't know maybe maybe you guys disagree but I feel like I finally beat my 80 day whatever ah this is still better [Music] oh I genuinely cannot thank you guys enough for all the love and support in these with making these videos it was such a massive encouragement for me to actually continue doing this I'm the kind of person that love to try different things I try new things all the time and I really enjoy doing that but every once in a while I find something that I really really really love and I will continue doing no matter what and I think art might just be one of those things for me I used to love drawing as a kid and I don't know why I stopped but I'm so happy to be back doing it it feels like I never saw I wanted this whole thing also to be inspiring I I want other people to have this experience as well people say that anyone can draw and I truly believe that and it goes for anything really like it's about practice constant practice no matter what it's not rocket science you put in the word work and you get an result for it hopefully like I said I love to do so many different things usually if I try something people are like oh yeah that's cool well watch me do it 100 times better and it's just kind of like ah yeah I'm just beginner but with the with me drawing it was genuinely just everyone being encouraging and I think that that was just amazing and I really appreciate that so yes thank you everyone I'll see you guys in the next one whenever that will be I don't know but it will be you are not going to believe what the next sponsor is

thank you for making my life easier honestly this is the most asked question I never get this question to stop I feel like I answer it a million times even my mom asked me and I'm like Mom we I've told you this this is it fix do you think it will be challenging for be to learn foreign languages my child struggle with speech how are you planning to navigate raising be in multilingual environment again as a parent you're forced to learn everything I don't know the what the best method is but uh I think be is not the only child in the world with parents that speak different languages usually what people do and that is proven to work is that I'll speak Swedish to be might say we speak Italian to be maybe we'll speak English together at some points then he can learn Japanese hopefully in school I don't know but I think right now people are asking like he's still very young right now he we're just trying to make him learn a couple of words here and there you know what's your idea on iPad kids and Tech kids how will you control be's Tech usage once he grows up it's kind of freaky how kids are so attracted to screens it's like they're hypnotized they're m IED I mean here I am looking at screens 95% of the time in my day but it's just not it feels weird when you're looking at a child doing it you're like no stop that stop looking at it I I don't really have strong opinions about screen times but I definitely we try to avoid as much as possible but I mean if be is really fuzzy we're at a restaurant and maybe we just want to eat our food for 5 minutes cuz it's too difficult yeah I think that's okay but I think to use it as a subsidy of just like instead of looking after him or engaging with him I think that's I don't know some people you got to do what you got to do as a parent though so I don't want to judge other people or feel like I'm like no never I hate the idea of a kids having their own technology like that just seems crazy to me they can play with toys kids should play with toys it worked for me I had a helicopter it was sick it went that's how helicopter sounded like according to myself as a child of course and now as an adult so here's another question do you let be watch cocomelon the answer is genuinely no I think it's really shitty animation if you have to let your kids watch something there are so many more productive and better things out there and I know the whole Coco melon feudo whatever it's like a one-sided me it was a joke mainly but I genuinely think it's really bad kids content and they should not be watching it sorry COC melon for for being so real will you teach be how to play Minecraft now this is the real stuff of course of course yes of course one thing I realized as a parent is that it's very easy to have opinions about kids if you haven't experienced any trouble with them or had one for that matter it's very easy to be principal and be like no a child should never play video games for more than 15 seconds there a very elaborate answer to this question I realized I think what I was getting at is that I'm cool with the I can't wait to play games with be I do think what I would do as a parent is teaching uh balance I think that's very important to enjoy many different things not just spend your entire day play video games I think that's bad as a child and I think that's bad as an adult uh there's more to life and you enjoy things more if you separate them what is the coolest thing be has done don't like bej has done a lot of cool things few weeks ago he learned how to high five that was very cool honestly like when you have your kid and it's born it can't do anything it's completely useless but eventually it grows and you learn and it changes and adapts and it's amazing to see it in front of you like going from not knowing anything to all of the sudden you know it can eat B can eat food on it own and now he's starting to use a fork and just I know that's like every kid will go through that development but when you see your own child do it it's just an incredible thing like who what I'm so proud of you for being able to do that even though yeah I don't know I wrote about this actually in a newsletter that me and Maria have where it's like part of the joy of having a child it's just like anything new he does you're so mesmerized by it's such an incredible thing to see genuinely even today like he he was copying me cuz I was blowing on him to make fun of him a little bit like and then he starts going it's so cute and he's never done it before it's so much fun uh where do you see yourself in 5 to 10 years from now still in Japan still doing YouTube so long as you're enjoying Felix please never stop your presence is wonderful influenced on this community and seeing you grow for thank you love you thank you for the nice comment I really struggle with this so much for the past couple months I've had major anxiety over this it's just been going looping in my head like I have to think ahead now like I have a child I have to think ahead like okay what are we going to do like are we going to say are we going to move back are we going to what's better for be what's better for me what's better for my family what makes more sense like it's doesn't really make sense to live in Japan like but we love it here and I like it's been driving me crazy I'm not going to lie like it's been really stressful but I think I finally just let it go I don't need to think 10 years ahead I've never done that in my life 20 years later okay here's the question I don't know do you do anyone know that life is way too complicated to think like that I think it's good to have a plan obviously but I think it was genuinely just stressing me out and not anything productive coming out of it and I think for now Japan is wonderful for be people are so loving and warm to be me and my say I love it here everything's great why why complicate it why overthink it you know that's at least what I need to do how do you feel like your relationship with M that changed since having be it definitely changes your relationship when you have a child job all of a sudden you have to manage this entirely new routine and that's taken over your entire life and it's a scary time which makes it stressful and all these things together it makes it really difficult to navigate and I think for a while especially in the beginning I did not really enjoy the beginning of having a baby cuz there was not that much to do a lot of early parents describe this feeling of like before you find your footing you're almost like roommates it's like okay now it's your turn now is your turn he would be awake so much during the night that we would have to like split our hours and like we we saw each other so the the least we've ever done because of it it's like we're living in different time zones uh so I think that was really hard but I now that be is becoming more of a boy it's just wonderful and we are both so incredibly proud of ban and now we have this amazing thing that we have together and we're sharing and so much to look forward in the future it's just like made us into to a family and that's a wonderful wonderful thing I love it who usually gets up to 3:00 a.m. to attend to be usually his mom try my best okay honestly like it depends but um we switch back and forth so if some someone has to do the night then that person gets to sleep in and so it kind of balanced out but yeah Mama usually what's it like developing your bond with be from when he was an infant to now yeah I kind of talked about it already like how a lot of parents love the infant face they see it as like a mini Holly and I'm like did we had experience the same thing like when it was the worst it was super stressful every baby's different obviously so I think that's probably ties into it but yeah some people say that the infant station is like yeah we just watch TV we just relax we just stay at home I'm so glad that now I can finally do stuff with be I think that's when our bond grows like we have a day a week now we're me and be do things together we go out we have lunch together I chat with him while we're out like it's a like hanging out with a really cool friend I love it I think that's where the bond comes maybe it's different for everyone but I remember like for me it wasn't like an on and off switch like oh oh you have a Chanel um father Instinct immediately kicks in you know it takes time to grow it what's your advice from new parents I'm you wishen you before do not listen to anyone or take any advice from anyone that hasn't had a child within the last 2 years cuz they don't remember anything honestly I cannot believe this ask anyone anything about having a kid that is older than a couple years they will not remember a single goddamn thing it's like if they went in went through this traumatic event and their brain has just completely blocked out all the information that they receiv received from it I swear to God if they if I didn't see the people's kids in front of me I wouldn't even believe they had a child to begin with cuz I'm asking them question very basic questions like okay so what when did you start doing this or okay so when did you oh so how did you tackle these things they're like I don't know like what the what the [Â __Â ] you're the least helpful person so ask someone that I had a child recently par after to bring in a baby into looks as beautiful as ever I admire her that's right she's got that Mom glow more gorgeous than ever I absolutely agree how has your perspective in life changed since becoming a dad how do you balance responsibilities and split task mindset you know before having a kid I always mem hating kids it is kind of funny like now I'm all of a sudden noticing other kids and I look at them and I'm like they're so cute and like you emphasize with other parents like if I hear a baby crying it's not annoying to me I feel bad for the parents having to deal with it or whatever and you try and help if you can so it does change your perspective so much how were you parented as a kid and what methods do you want to continue and abandoned for bearing okay so a meme online is this like Millennial soft parenting everyone makes fun of it because it's like it's just Bullit like you need to just tell a child off sometimes but the millennial ways like sitting down talking to them how are you feeling you know yeah I think that's probably a balance but I do remember I think I think I was soft parenting cuz I remember one time I bit at kindergarten I think I must have been 3 or 4 years old this one of my earliest memories I bit my friend in the ear cuz he was super annoying it was actually his fault completely obviously and uh my dad came to kindergarten he wouldn't do that normally obviously I guess the teachers called my dad I knew I was in trouble trouble and I knew what I did you know it would be the kind of thing where like parents maybe get super angry and they take their kid home or something like that and I remember my dad just sat down next to me and just talked to me about it and uh that was it and I think I really appreciated that Approach at least now I do I think at then as well like I knew what I did was bad I didn't need to be yelled at you know what I mean uh but it he still sat down and talked to me and explain what it was wrong and I think yeah that's probably what I want to do as a bad I really appreciate my parents for doing that for being understanding and patient obviously there are times to be understanding and patient there are there are times to just be like knock that sh off you're going to hurt somebody uh or yourself I think again what I said earlier like it's easy to have principles and ideas about parenting if you haven't faced the struggles yet and I'm not really there yet with be so you know do you ever think for a second you would be a dad before having a kid or thought of having one okay I wrote this in my newsletter as well how when Maya was sick it kind of felt like taking care of a baby and for some reason that sort of clicked in my head like like we're kind of ready we're ready to have a child we're already taking care of one in a sense like it was such a obviously it's way different and I know that now but it just felt like we had this huge responsibility and I think that was like a nice Silver Lining of Maya being really sick for the last year that we had her so but I like you just don't know I think you absolutely have to be ready for having a child and you going to 100% want to have a child and uh also like I'm talking a lot lot positively about being a parent but honestly I respect any opinion of wanting to have a child is totally fine obviously you can live a long happy prosperous life either way you know uh but I do feel like now that I do have a child it changed my perspectives completely on life I feel so excited to be sharing it's like experiencing life again with a brand new set of eyes like I look forward to everything I I love to do again to do with be and share with be and face all these new challenges with be like yeah I want people to experience it I want more of my friends to have kids I hope they are watching this video and realize it's worth having children yes it's hard as but I don't know like just doing YouTube for the rest of my life what I like I have purpose now more purpose bigger [Music] purpose what's the most difficult uh thing yeah the language barrier here you need a pediatrician right and to find one that speaks English near us has been kind of difficult emergencies happen I think it's always kind of scary like that I don't speak Japanese fluently yet to the point where it's like when it's really important I I want to be able to be there for be if he needs it and a lot of times people don't speak English here in Japan so it's it's really difficult and scary and then it's a good motivator for me to actually like learn the language better and I think also like okay I learned these recently in Japan in Japan they have a ton of international schools a ton of them they're everywhere but it's not like International kids are going there it's for Japanese kids to learn English International School just means super expensive English lessons for kids we don't need to pay a ton of money for be to learn English he's not going to do that anyway so what was be's first word be's first word was mama and then he said dad now he says Papa his first word was baba baba say blowing BB item it's really cute we have that on video I can show that he hasn't really said it yet he's really in the face where now he's starting to really pick up words he's also said Lampa one time which means lamp in Swedish increases vocabulary slowly but surely yeah it's amazing to see him speak it's funny cuz he understands us you can ask him questions and he can say like you know he'll tell you if he wants to do something or not it's really really cute even though he can't really speak you can still communicate with him which is again like a thing he couldn't do before and now he can it's like what that's incredible ah have simped for my child this entire video thank you for watching I hope maybe that was helpful for people um considering ever becoming a parent you know there a lot of things to consider and um maybe you find helpful if anything thank you guys for always being so sweet and wonderful uh all the comments about B has been uh in the Vlogs especially like it's been so nice and it makes me actually want to share him online like a lot of people are very opinionated about having kids online or not and I think I share those opinions but he's so young right now that it doesn't matter like he doesn't understand any of it I don't have a personal issue having kid photos of me online like that doesn't matter to me so but I you know there will definitely be a time where we will not show be online and that will probably be the end of the Vlogs uh so I just wanted to be upfront about that now but for now yeah we are we really really appreciate all the love so thank you broest,unknown

hate it before you watched it this is sorry sorry yeah yeah I were to start podcast scratch in 2024 I would start with a video podcast video barrier of Entry because we all talk we all have conversations a video podcast essentially is just capturing a Kim we should do a podcast we should to do a podcast and just capture our conversation there's so many of these now I don't know if you ever watch like shorts I don't go on Tik Tok but it's always some Rando saying some in podcast why is he served to me who are you the thing about the podcast as well is like I don't know if anyone actually watches the whole podcast or if the only way people know the podcast is from the clips that they farm and put on Tik Tok you know there's so many of them God damn it's infestation we were ahead of our time Ken we had a video podcast when no one else had a video podcast we were the only ones literally the only ones they did no one else existed wrong time to do we just yeah if we would

tips for help and you end up in like this where it's like what the are they even saying like I feel like people this is just feeling a need for people but I just wonder what it actually does you know what I mean no yeah yeah no that's that's kind of the thing it goes along with uh you have to create content you can create any kind of content there's like a niche for everything like I watch people who raise chickens and and plant Gardens on M I know it's one of those things yeah I know you can like you literally do anything as long as you're making the content and you got to curb your expectations to like the niche that you're going into right like it's not like a widespread reach but ultimately you got to you just make it and you can find success in whatever it is that you want to make if you're good at it if you're funny charismatic or you just pay people to watch I don't know right yeah one of the two all right more [Music] advice sorry guess what's creeping in the new gfuel

different flavors or just good time to stock up all right thank you Gil as always for sponsoring this video and and bye here's how to use chbt to make a faceless AI YouTube video just like this YouTube channel that got 3.3 million views step number one Chachi yeah but it's a short Oh short form is different so God maybe they go into it but I mean short form is literally like even a a bigger focus on just make stuff and throw it out there just throw stuff until it sticks course make it good so when people watch it they enjoy it but the more the better really on short form I still don't understand how it blew up because it's like the revenue you get from it s so oh yeah that's the thing about short form though it's not about the revenue like the the value you get from short form is the awareness and the growth like there's YouTubers now that wait wait wait k can we do that again but as if we have a video podcast oh so can how do I grow my YouTube short content all right so what you got to do is you got to understand that when you wake up every day at 4:00 a.m. because you're an alpha male you got to get up you got to hit the gym and you got to hit your fun you have good ins no no no just do the good Insight I that was kid uh you got to make a lot of content make a whole bunch of it just keep making it make it constantly make your entire life content throw it until something sticks and then you use that and you move it over to a different platform and then you upload the exact same thing there and then you take it over to another platform and you just go everywhere until you exist everywhere and people can't stop thinking about you and then whenever you become famous then you do some bad things allegedly and get canceled just the [Music] cycle the last bit yes there's so much of this I I couldn't escape it it's just like make AI shorts you got to make AI shorts like and you're thinking in the scale of 10 years like if you literally are grinding and you're obsessed and you're just every day studying and and learning you surround yourself with smart people and you just work like hell to be honest for 10 years like there's probably a good chance you'll make it but if you do that over the course of six months or a year I don't know it's a kind of a big commitment years I get the point I get the point but why are all the Gatorade bottles in the shot have the Gatorade logo taken off of them and where are they there's like in a random Warehouse with like a metal table that's pretty bad place to do a podcast yes yes Gatorade is not paying them so they have to see at the but under his foot down there it's the freaking like icy blast or whatever flavor they're all over the place we two bottles everywhere in here K what the I don't know little things like that that bug me like why take the time to why don't you just move the bottles out of the side why the bottles there if you're so worried about the brain there like a million things to comment about what he just said but Ken just goes there's a gatorade bottle there with not a on and that gatorade bottle like all right like I got to do is just go 10 years you know whatever and you know do some stuff over at the span of a decade a lot of people are very short-term SED but you know as long as you're innovating adapting reinvesting I think if you do it intelligently imagine like you're on 9 years still no no one gives a about your channel and you're like one more year here we go one more one more year here we go but Mr Beast told me I got I got to innovate and I got to be intelligent oh my life has passed before me I'm going to die so close I'm so close one more year was so close oh man I feel like I was kind of lucky I don't know how it was for you but like I had momentum that kind of set its way through like uh one thing happened and then another thing happens and then I I think if you don't have those steps like yeah there's no way you're going to keep going right yeah or if you're like me and you have those steps where momentum goes or even like you force feeding me momentum and then I keep doing things to ruin the momentum you know momentum's huge though if you can keep it rolling it's massive that's what the game's all about that's why like a lot of creators that like blow up they're like their channels are only like 2 years old but they're like doing huge numbers because like all the viewers are still there and like old channels like ours like half the subs are are dead Subs yes yes yes I mean I took a step back and you can tell what difference that makes on on the channel it's like you have to cuz I when I was in it I was always just trying to like okay next thing okay next thing like so you get a video that pops off it's like what ever next thing like you never there's no time for anything right and I guess well one of the biggest perks of having you as a friend is that I got to kind of like experience a lot of that through you as well okay and like there's there's plenty of good but there's also like a lot of bad that comes with it too like a lot of pressure and stuff and I yes I was always like pretty content and I still am with like what I have I don't know I just feel like I don't want to deal with the stuff that you had to deal with right seems really annoying and like I know it's like oh annoying too about all this stuff well yeah yeah in days from YouTube shorts generated entirely by ai ai you have to make AI shorts AI content K AI content that's what people want automated videos stolen clips from other people that doesn't make you any money but you get views I guess so that's cool but wait a minute aren't we watching clips from other people right now go go back to making Gatorade comments [Music] can uh I remember I don't know who it was there was someone that I had hired maybe like a painter or like whatever and he told me my son my son got a 5 million views on YouTube cuz I he figured out I was a YouTuber so he was telling bragging about his son he's cute it's not like that but he was like didn't make any money though cuz he just re-uploaded someone else's video he got he got copyright claimed and could have made a lot of money but then [Music] you okay I love these videos uh cuz I don't know's how to cut and edit your videos using the YouTube Studio editing first thing you want to do is go into the YouTube studio and then you're going to go over to content and from here you want to select the video that you are going trim or cut I just love you Ed in YouTube I didn't know you well I mean wait you didn't know that I know you can like cut things out but like not like you know you cut like a piece out and then it processes for like two hours yeah that's what he's doing but I just love his tutorial like okay so to edit a video in YouTube You're Going To Go to youtube.com and you're going to go into your videos and then you're going to select the video that you want to edit I'm like no I shouldn't select another video it's like how do they get so bad at this once we're inside of this view all you need to do is go over here to the left God wait I'm supposed to click Editor to edit the video thank God there's a tutorial for this I don't want to be too mean but I feel like this encapsulates so many tutorials on YouTube where I have to click through this and I think I just took it out on this poor guy listen watch time is important you know he's guess it's better to do this yes that's right here's some simple steps to help you make your YouTube video go viral with my team and I currently running over 200 YouTube channels we have almost 5 billion views across all of those channels there's really only three things you need to look at to get a this guy is really flexing out of nowhere God damn Christ 200 YouTube channels wow I can barely manage two if you want more tips like this on how you can go viral on YouTube and make a ton of money he made 43,000 since 19 so like no April 19 sorry sorry s what is it like 3 years 2 years oh is that over multiple years yes it's over I can't read it yeah okay okay that's like below minimum wage it is isn't it I know it looks big here but like if you look over the span of 3 years that's below minimum wage I'm just saying if we're going to start a channel from zero how do we get to our first 100,000 Subs to start a video podcast video podcast why that say I had 177 views what like yeah oh yeah the like what 177 s days ago I'm to dominate YouTube and then Channel they linked earlier didn't even have 100,000 subscribers itself what is this is this like one of those things where the dudes are like flexing their Lamborghinis and all they do is like rent the Lamborghini I feel like anyone that explains anyone that explains these things usually that's the case right are these people giv good advice and we're just super disconnected cuz we I don't know I'm so disconnected I have no CL this might be great advice that's why I'm here to study it yeah maybe I should start start taking notes right now oh my God what would you do if you had to start over from nothing what would you do Felix the thing is I know what to do and I hate it and I'm I'm so annoyed by it and I see it more and more where it's like you have to give a reason for people to give watch times you have to like Aller something at the end of the video like look guys you watch to the end of the video because then we're going to kiss each other and it's going to be great skip to the end to see what you're talking about oh God they are wow and like yeah when people try to purposely manipulate watch time to like really get people in or like super fast cut and it's like this is feels so so less not so less that that's makes it seem like it's more than it it just feels so manufactured that's the word and I just yeah any [Music] authenticity authenticity it just feels like you're just mirroring what you think people want instead of creating what you actually want you know what I mean and I think that not to be like oh it has to be like w i I think it just feels so lame to deliberately do it but I can't say I'm uh immune to it either like obviously like you upload videos that you think people are going to like at the end of the day but I think when yeah the video itself seems so formed around that idea of like the algorithm will love this I just hate it I can't do it like I know I know like I mean I'm stuck on 111 million but it's not like I don't know how to get out of that yeah yeah it's like like I always talking about before we start recording is like I I know how to make my channel bigger yes exactly but I I don't want to because it's guys yeah I'm also very I'm I'm very happy kind of I like my community the way it is I don't want to shake it up too much and have all these new people in here being mad at me about nothing exactly worth it here's the best website to help you go viral on you tool.com three you then take those tag into wool.com this website then generates all the tags that these videos are tags remember when people were obsessed with tags on YouTube like that was yeah I do remember and then YouTube changed ways and tags are literally worthless now and they're only good for people that misspell and so loading up on tags literally does nothing I think yeah it's always been the top line of the description but it's it's title Top Line description and then your thumbnail if some sometimes you put words in there it matters back in the day people were obsessed with tags do you remember how many tags if you go to my old videos there like whole thing and I would put them in the description too cuz I'm like I don't trust that you would go to the bottom of the description them down there and this is like a really like I guess like you know what I shouldn't hate on this cuz I've done a lot of like that where I'm like I want to grow my channel this is how you do it and you know what I mean yep yep yep but but I feel like I feel like no one had any clue back then now it seems more obvious back then it's like I don't know what works but someone did this and I'm going to do this actually you know what that's still how it is it seems like what a throwback there was so many ways to to manipulate YouTube back in the day do you remember when there was like different genres on the home homepage so there would be like Politics on the home homepage there'd be like nature and on the homepage and then people would like yeah there was nature in my video I I think I'll tag that as a nature so you get put on the front page even though you like don't deserve it just cuz you tagged your video people do it all the time and I know who those people are and I hate them still I never forget and I never forgive I told you there's this one guy I told you this right but what' he do he said his channel was Swedish so he would always be on the Swedish homepage yeah cuz you could set your yeah yeah you set your country fake sweed me and I'm like dude you're not I I'm dying over here you're not giving me a chance cuz I thought he was Swedish I was like oh I didn't know he was Swedish and then I look it up I'm like no he's American so I write him I'm like dude please can you change you're killing me over here and this smirky ass was like a little competition ain't going to kill anyone I'm like you freak sweet me you are not swe stop cheating you're cheating a YouTuber cheating no way why do you bother replying I'll never forget I won't say who it is dead to me your first video is not going to give views period it's not your first 10 are not going to give views I can very confidently say that all you need to do this applies to people who have dreams of being a YouTuber is make 100 videos and improve something every time do that and then on did you get views on your1 101st video I don't remember my 101st video was I got views on my first video though oh well there you go yeah what what a Mr be YouTube that was a long time ago nowadays that's pretty much true like it's hard to break through and then when when finally you do have something that does hit you need to have a backlog so they will go and watch your other stuff too and then but it do it does seem like for the first time it seems like DM actually serves me like new videos of like similar channels like that would never happen before but now I think it they're trying to do it right well I know the algorithm changed a lot from back in the day used to back in our day it would find viewers for your video now it finds videos for viewers kind of thing like like it would just like bring people to you and now you have to make something that fits what their viewer profile is that makes sense I used to refresh my videos cuz I thought it was embarrassing to have L me too like I got to get like especially early like I got get to over 100 come on boy we refresh the sucker well you know they stop at 300 right I didn't I hit the limit just go to 100 be like that's enough I'm bored Ah that's why I that's why I have 110 million that's why you did it put in the work too lazy oh man the other thing I did that was kind of embarrassing was that I would message people with similar videos like mine i' be like I know you like this video what what do you think of mine yeah got real mad at me doing that I'm like just but then that one guy was like actually you know what pretty good I'm like yeah told you told you bro I remember going to bigger channels and like leaving witty comments that would get up voted y yep nice nice oh I see I see I see I see I don't think it would help today but it did back then that was actually kind of kind of crazy how the self-promotion crap that is so cringe today it it's that's awful but I did it but you have to when you start up I I think I'm realizing now watching all this and reflecting on my own it's like you just have to try really hard it's like anything if you want to stand out there's going to be a million people doing it you just have to try really hard like that's it damn this there is there isort for sure yeah but I think also helped me at least like if I didn't get encouragement throughout I I would probably have not put so much oh yeah like all the guys at the top every single one of them that had like big moments of like momentum and they've been able to capitalize on it exactly ex it's kind of the key and that's like the part where people like talk about it's luck you know yes exactly exactly yeah what do you think about the whole luck thing I got a whole opinion about it but what do you think about when people are like oh I just got lucky I think you can be lucky M but then it's like what you do from there like there's been so many channels going up and like uh going up and then just completely vanish and it's like yeah because they got a chance and they didn't take it I I think that's that's how I see it I think luck is something that you create opportunity for right like you don't just sit there in your room one day and get lucky and all of a sudden you're a big YouTuber right you have to make videos and they Al actually have to be entertaining so I guess you can get lucky and be an entertaining personent yes right you just you have to be making it and there's like and I don't I hate it when people kind of just just give it all to luck CU you know YouTubers in general don't want to be like yeah I worked hard to get here because the people in the comments would be like I work a full-time job you've never worked in your life you know you get that crap back yeah but uh I hate it when that when YouTubers or content creators like discount themselves on that their skill is just luck because if being a YouTuber a content creator was easy literally everyone would be doing it and be successful at it but they're not and do I think that yeah I absolutely think content creators are better than you so you know what we're working harder and maybe I am luckier than you you just wish you were us all right we're better that's also yeah you have to be extremely arrogant to be a YouTuber exactly that's part of it cuz I was served like a smaller channel YouTube uh smaller channels now on YouTube like I said and you watch them I'm like yeah they're not there like you can tell they're an early content creator they don't have it in them yet but they they'll get there you know what I mean like it is a skill to make videos clip that we're watching right now Mr be talking about making the 100 videos and that's part of kind exactly exactly oh you tied it back in nice you did it brought it back around I do want to add one thing real quick that I just thought about uh that if anybody's actually watching this video and trying to take advice is that the content that you create results in the community that you're going to have so if you don't want to have a toxic Community but you want you just want to be a YouTuber then if you make drama content and like stuff like that then you're going to have a toxic community and you're going to get stuck into that because they are only going to water to watch you for that one thing so just be careful if you get into it try to make stuff that you actually want to make it's important that was deep yeah sorry probably went over everyone's head they're like whatever man just give me the views baby I love the cuz it's like what the it looks so fabricated starting a YouTube channel in 2024 what would you do you have to start messy you probably have a million questions what Niche what topic what about this what about that it's so rehearsed I love it this fake podcast thing this is not from a podcast they you don't talk like this no am I the only one I don't look at herting if you were starting at your channel now what would you do Ken you have to get dig deep dig deep and get messy take the dir SC many people have heard the story of Mr Beast who talks about how he uploaded 200 terrible videos before I thought it was 100 no he did he went the extra mile he made 200 for 10 years no watch Moment On YouTube if you look at the gaming Creator PewDiePie he uploaded hundreds of videos look that bab face and when you ask those creators how they feel about their first videos they would tell you the videos suck they suck yes no they were great what do you mean is this how dare you my first videos were really good can you see this yeah I can see okay let's watch my first video look at this we're going back to the Call of Duty hey guys it's me PewDiePie and I am back with Black Ops with an awesome game of Search and Destroy you don't sound the don't sound the same person anymore yes it was 13 14 years ago Ken it's a you know I'm not that good at COD anymore but I used to be really good yeah well you told me cuz I asked you like where the name PewDiePie came from and you told me it was from playing yeah yeah look look at this 30 I went 32 okay that's a 15 KD I could I can do that now like if I could change all my Subs to be this good at Call of Duty again I would take it in a heartbeat in a heartbeat that's all you want please remember the tags very bottom like the show more down there and that where it is tag sub more yeah hell yeah let's play let's walk through play through through walk peie oh every single word it's not that bad that's not that bad I don't know why I Ted Carolina or North Carol put a limit on how many you can put in there now too North Carolina North Carolina maybe that's where the game took place at or something North Carolina's when they try and find about their country be real disappointed when they get out e part two it's part seven sorry all right well that was pretty insightful I hope I can finally get to 112 million Subs I'm praying please anyway check out Ken and I'll see you guys next time byebye bye ah ah

QL6SQEb48zY,"is AI ready to take over mankind yet today we investigate how far AI has come maybe you are intelligent enough to realize this video so far is made entirely by AI no freaking way I just blew your mind can you believe it oh AI is AI is going to take over any point any point now there it's it's just too good my last AI video was a year ago so I thought now would be a good time to update what has happened since then in a year and the result went from really bad oh what what is that a no no it's actually really really good wa what the W so let's begin first off I wanted to check AI videos that has been the great new progress of AI it can make video now and it's not terrible ball okay so after a little bit of research I found this Chinese Ai and it's actually pretty cool here we have a cat that's cool here we have a guy that's cool it's kind of yeah it's a mermaid it's a cat on a catwalk I know how to test this if the video AI is good enough remember the Will Smith eating pasta give me Will Smith eating pasta [Music] oh it's not B it's not bad it's not good I just love how all the other AIS are like oh no uh we can't use real people and celebrities China be like yeah yeah yeah that makes that makes me wonder actually can we use like other let's try Super Mario dancing oh it actually does it and he's dancing he's totally dancing I love that China copyright they don't care fun story actually I don't own PewDiePie in China I haven't for the last I don't know 10 years my lawyer was like yeah what are you going to do I'm I don't know any copyright on this

overlords PewDiePie broest camera what the is that what I know I should be happy but why am I so ugly at least there should be some like super chat and super buff it's not bad I hate it I hate it all right let's try Minecraft mcraft dog eats a cheep that's not how you spell it thank you Chinese Minecraft be like it's yeah all right so Chinese AI pretty good I wanted to check out if AI video games was a thing I I don't know like I genuinely have no clue I found this website called the roseb AI where you can kind of make your own game you can alter it you can alter it and change it but he this game was pretty good I'm not going to lie grass is high bles are dead hate this lawn ground [Music] anchor St I I don't think we're quite there with AI generated video games and I don't think I'd ever want to play an AI generated video game but who knows so the big new development what I understand in AI is Luma video you probably seen them so I wanted to try it out myself and I tried it out during a live stream and I had a ton of fun I loved it cuz it's so bad that it's hilarious and you can basically use yourself just an image of yourself give it a prompt and it will turn it into a video so I try this one you just take a photo of yourself oh my God and I wrote PewDiePie eats a fish M yummy fish so you can extend these so I had the fish one and then I extended it to put the fish in his mouth cuz I wanted to see if they can do that uh so here we go will I do it yes oh and where where was that fish going where was that fish going don't put the fish in your no no no no oh my God PewDiePie become sexy I added to cuz I wanted to see if I could oh oh it's spinning oh that's weird it looks like you broke your neck maybe I should do that then and break his neck enhance here we go oh god what happened to my nose jumps into a pool I wanted to see if it can just like something makes no sense whoa what the wo wo that was a [Â __Â ] trip dude Jesus Christ damn did not expect that [Music] shees jumps out theing window becomes his legs I my legs become my arms that's cool the future is here guys there's a cart oh god oh [Â __Â ] me oh that's insane cartwheel ising amazing so like really physical moves AI is like yeah bet I can do that rides a motorcycle whoa I like that I like that oh you can't see it I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry there we go sorry sorry look at this yeah yeah I look cool as that was good I'm impressed by that that's like smart way to do it PewDiePie broest the camera oh oh no no no I don't think I would have any subscribers if I did that anyway guys ending the video here with the bro no that's not my teeth I don't think so at least try adding an end frame okay good idea let's do that I just got to take a screenshot of myself so it it has that data you know what I mean okay I do that and then I do so I eat something and then what what's the story okay how about this I I'll just die there we go I think that's the way to do it all right I eat and then I die I eat YouTube play button and dies okay oh my God oh my God I'm eating the play [Music] button that's horrible horrible okay how about the more Simple Thing screams and then dies ah screams and then that one didn't make it through and then falls asleep [Music] [Laughter] why did that tongue come out ah yes this is how I fall asleep every night I look cuz I did the tongue at the end it just like Boop let's do the opposite then wakes up and screams this is how I wake up as well it's beautiful I love it yes drinks uh delicious be I don't know how to spell beverage beverage yes ooh ooh oh it goes that's a good transition that's smart what the is that why is it lagging at that frame stop it go [Laughter] skydiving what the h I mean the transition was not very clean but I love the shakiness before like I'm about to lose it I don't like how AI depicts me it doesn't feel like me at all I oh my [Music] God whoa whoa hell [Music] yeah I love how it seems like guys I got do this hold up Pikachu is cooked oh oh god what the what a what no no Cur curs is PokÃ©mon should never be real oh God oh God why did he he do that why why AI okay play trumpet play the trumpet play the trumpet oh now what was I doing with that trumpet I thought there was Community restrictions for this delete that one delete that no finally we had music AI I had no idea it's actually pretty funny I can actually see myself using this I feel like it's like a way to make uh instead of making postcards you can make like a fun song customized for you like just an example here's if someone's Grandma passes away you can send them this hey I'm sorry your grandma is dead hey I'm so sorry your grandma is dead dead dead dead dead hey I'm so sorry your grandma is dead hey

around lern there's no people Perfect Light we take like a million photos and then might M just somehow I don't know how deletes them all of them D deleted all the photos the our our camera is in Japanese but I still think like you clicked without reading what you were pressing cuz I know you know how to read that I'm sitting next to you and you say I want to transfer them to my phone and then literally like 30 seconds later they're deleted they're all gone anyway we're going to a camera store it's all close today's a holiday as well so we can't really like we're hoping we can save them somehow but we're going to try and get a different SD card in the meanwhile so that we don't use the one but it's it's a bank holiday and everything's closed so we don't even know if we can do [Music] that we uh we're driving to like the tallest elevator in the world but the view just getting here is unreal so yeah we're stopping here to have a little quick picnic that's crazy crazy this is not a bad Technic SP so I may or may not have driven on a road where cars are not allowed apparently there's a hike up to the elevator that we're going to so I'm stopping here and then we're going to hike the rest of the way but I don't know how long it is I have no idea hopefully it's short because we are not prepared for a hike I have slippers on the hike begins I felt like we have to do a hike in Switzerland oh boy there he is Mommy I think uh we're just we're just walking up now we're not taking the elevator it's stoning upon me and people are walking down from the elevator so this is a special day for for us special moood we made it hey oh [Music] damn all right we're taking it down and then we're taking it up again and then we're walking down again cuz we don't know where we are anyway look at this be likes it you like it be all right we get to ride the elevator for free he's got to walk out I paid him that [Music] and here we are we made it back two tired parents who did a hike that they did not sign up for I'm very tired my hips are destroyed from carrying him we uh decided to stop by another Lake it's a little smaller but still massive I'm so tired from that hike that I don't even know but but yeah this is great this is from uh krama maybe you've seen it crash landing on you they meet she comes paragliding into this North Korean guy that's in Switzerland for some reason now that's a comfy boy [Music] so uh that was absolutely not worth it way too touristic kind of ruined it and the castle was closed so it's really beautiful beautiful Village back at the hotel going to sketch a little bit today was kind of a string of failures like Maria deleted all the photos that we took I took us up the wrong path and made us go a hike instead of what we wanted to do then we went to this other place and it was kind of too touristy and I still had a great day and I feel like it's days like these that you remember so yeah really loving Switzerland so far it's super

need to go left at the end of the bridge but traffic is backed up on the right side so it makes sense that I would move to the left side so I don't have to sit in traffic for a lane that I'm not going to go how would I possibly know that in advance of going on this bridge goddamn Bridges well anyway I I I changed Lane and I look around are there any cops are there any cars the bridge is completely empty there's nothing unsafe about the maneuver I'm about to do I even cautiously blink before crossing the lines cuz I am aware oh yeah yeah yeah I blink even though no one's there and as soon as I

where's a good jumping off point has to be a big body of water or some a love be I could jump into the lava it's it's got to be on this side right no what the no how how did that even happen how did that even happen it was a father of a child to me what how did that happen moang can I quit and save and go back if I go back quick enough I can I can say I can fix this I can fix is [Music] SW are you kidding me I'm starting to think she wanted to die how the you she fell from a tree I fed her as well I can't even enjoy the game now look at that cool thing flying I can't even enjoy that I'm going to have to jump in her honor I think it's the only way s jumped so we could jump as well I think the only way is to jump into the lava then jump out of the lava I think that's the only way is that a good idea lava doesn't slow your fall what the is lava then maybe she's back at base I think s is back at base somehow I got this uh weird feeling I'm so mad why why is that a thing she was well fed s was a wellfed and happy dog she tried to kill me multiple times but we loved each other I fed her show the footage don't jump now I F there no remorse no sadness I well obviously sadness I would have been so sick to jump with s she loves jumping clearly clearly she jumping no it's not funny she's dead she's never coming back okay um is that water I feel like that's water what do you guys think is that water water what do you guys think is that water oh right boats don't have fall damage I could just jump with the boat I just had this idea all on my own good idea me thank you all right listen if you guys are so smart then why did no one tell me that s l was literally starving today explain that here we go I'm going to do it this one is for S L play play side epic music okay this one works my dog my beautiful dog my companion my loyal companion in life I loved you you were like a child and father and son and daughter and mother all those things you tried to kill me so many times but we had a special bond special bond that no one could understand such love and such beauty you love jumping you love jumping so much it was the end of you and therefore I will jump the bravest jump anyone's ever taken in Minecraft this one is for you s here I go I love you that was pretty cool all right I should probably get back home such beautiful this one is for you spend I know you weren't veggie I mean pescitarian but this one's for you do I go back to my base this place looks so much cooler right I don't know like I'd have diamonds at home but s l isn't at home it'll be

bunch of liars bet you're going to blame that one on me too somehow I don't even want the meat I just want murder Justice for S the real question is what the is that how do I do that the ghost of s lives on she speaks to me can you summon uh can you summon can you summon dogs in the game have they added that update can you Resurrect The Dead like full meal Alchemist have they added that update in the game I think they should do that next is that the icebergs we must be close I see the icebergs I'm still stop it there's different dogs in different biomes so maybe that was a fake s after [Music] all all right the boat is dead don't ask I knew they were ask where's SW and my tear I'm crying I don't even care if I get hit oh okay that's too that's that's just mean now you're just being mean I shouldn't have thrown away all my food but is it was what send would have want Jesus I'm going to die if you keep shooting at me s s is that you is that I'm going to die I'll come back for you

wait I have a ton of iron nugget let's go back to base base my intuition say house is here I remember this tree my intuition say house is this way my internal compasses there's that tree again [Â __Â ] my intuition which is imp told you I told you I never get lost Marcia God bless her uh she always gets lost the best part about Marc getting lost is that she's so confident she for me it's like I know we're heading left or I know we're heading right she just picks the direction and goes with it sometimes I just go along and just to see what happens here I am traveling the beautiful world of Minecraft what why isn't not loading I can't see if only I had to downloaded sely that's right when you travel the world you need to stay connected everyone uses the internet I can't live without it especially when traveling how else am I going to check into my Airbnb this actually happened to us when we were traveling to Italy I didn't have an internet the whole trip it was a nightmare just because I didn't want to stand in line at the airport and sign up for those Wi-Fi boxes that they give you this just such a hassle to go through all that process it's the last thing I want to do after a long flight but damn that i' regret it cuz not having Internet is such an issue so now with the app called S I can set this up at home right now activate it when I'm ready it takes literally just a couple minutes I tried it myself and boom I have internet on my phone when traveling as it should be it's got 150 countries available with 24-hour support so if you have any issues they're there to set you up and if it doesn't work for whatever reason your phone is incompatible I don't know you get refunded so you got nothing to lose so I recommend checking out s next time traveling it's a must and of course I got you guys hooked up so check out the link in the description that's s.com PewDiePie and if you use that link you get 15% off or use the code PewDiePie either way use both go crazy I don't know save money save time save hassle say no more I'm never I'm never traveling again without using S thank you s for sponsoring this video that's you're not making me

hrHK7FNgnrM,oh today we're doing another book review it's one that I've already discussed which is sun and Steel by Yuki Mishima I adore mishima's novels this is no secret but the author is controversial so I just want to be clear I want to discuss the book and that's it for me the main appeal has always been How Deeply introspective his work is this is something that I find so fascinating and immersive it almost feels like the author is trying to understand himself through his novels but in Sun and steel Mishima speaks to us directly about his philosophy instead and we learn why this novelist in 1960s Jaan decided to one day just pick up bodybuilding this book combines building muscle with philosophy and topics that you would normally wouldn't see together Sun still is unique to say the least but I read this years ago and I realized just how much it helped me form my own ideas so I wanted to break this down the same way this novel was built which is through sun and steel so I'll be doing my weekly workout and you guys can come along training the mind isn't so different from training the body through challenges and practic this we eventually advance and can move on to even harder problem but often for many people at least they see the mind and body as very separate while one is pursued the other one is often left neglected I'm working out outside today because be sleeps on the room next to me and I thought it made sense as well and there's something uh really nice about being outside it's a luring wanting to reach higher when you look up on the blue sky so it sort of fits for today as well Mishima thought there was too much emphasis on intellectuality in society and I think there's something interesting about a Nobel prew worthy novelist coming to this thought as an author he felt his words were corrosive thoughts on their own are just that they're abstract while in contrast the physical has actual grounds in reality so he believed that the body and mind when trained together they complement each other and that leads to a higher form of self-improvement Miss I believe true wisdom and fulfillment came from this interplay of thinking and doing just thinking on its own or night thinking as he coined it was something going downwards if your words should have any value you must live them yourself all true philosophers understand and live this so Mishima as a writer for him words had come first and now he likened this new found wisdom as a new language the language of the flesh he called it and in his Pursuit he chose and still to hate him one two three that concludes today's exercise I just showed pieces of it but body and mind I think is it's essential I just need it to ground me with with my thoughts I overthink I become anxious and I just can't I can't imagine my life without one or another at least in Sun and steel we're read of a secret Energy Formula that brought Mishima to a hidden state of physique and focused mind today we know of course that he was talking about G fuel's caffeine-free hydration flavors listen it's summer we need to hydrate more than ever g- fuel's caffeine-free flavors is a great way to motivate you to drink more because of the delicious g- fuel flavors you can stay hydrated and not infringe on your daily caffeine intake they're literally zero everything Zero caffeine zero sugar zero calories seral depths with 5% muscle increase guaranteed I think maybe I know this is a bit out of place but it also is a perfect fit because this drink is vitamin fortified which means it supports healthy brain functionality mind and body combined right now if you use code PewDiePie in the next 48 hours only you will save 30% off so definitely take advantage of that code PewDiePie uh there's a bunch of new flavors and new arrivals that you can check out as well it's a great way to support the channel and you guys can save 30% off so appreciate it Mishima thought the body might be capable of its own logic and thought kind of a bold statement he engaged in martial arts K though and he believed physical activities like sports can provide us with a certain knowledge so this is an embodied knowledge which teaches us our limits strengths weaknesses they also make us understand our bodies coordination balance endurance resistance resilience to pain and this is knowledge that is purely felt and therefore grasped unconsciously in a sense you feel the sweat that runs down your forehead and and you feel the strain in your muscle when they reach their capacity and this is a reminder of our body's capabilities and responses physique is often overlooked for many it's a second thought at best but missiona points out that those who have gained muscle and physical strength rarely or if ever argue that their efforts are useless they recognize their efforts as something worthwhile and beneficial and this is a conclusion they come to often without even giving any conscious thought to it just like embodied wisdom it's felt with this embodied knowledge we gain a practical wisdom that we can apply to real life situations and this is a deep intuitive understanding of what works and what doesn't that was hard I think what with sports or bouldering in particular that taught me is that you're always more capable than you think you are and I think gaining that confidence it kind of applies to anything really and it's such a valuable thing to teach yourself and I'm really grateful for it's a good embodied knowledge the sun is obviously a central theme in Mishima sun and steel it represents life and strength and Mishima believed that the exposure to Sun was necessary for his mind and body so he let the sun color his skin as a way of branding him in a sense it represented his dedication to this philosophy and choosing pain over comfort as a reminder that he's actively living his thought and I quite like this it reminds me of when Greek philosophers would rather have their heads cut off than to lose their beards it's just another way of reminding yourself and displaying that you're living your philosophy because just like muscles are fluid and requires constant maintenance as so there's our commitment to our ideas pain is necessary it should not be feared or try to be avoided this goes both mentally and physically anyone who reached a certain level in strength training will have learned to love the pain in brains when feeling this sensation it tests our endurance resistance and willpower and this is how we can push Beyond and reach new levels of physical but also mental strength missa thought pain was valuable because it reveals our vulnerabilities and weaknesses it forces us to understand ourself because it reveals the core of our characters anyone can save phas until they've truly suffered pain thus forces us into self-awareness and introspection we can also transform through pain mentally and physically we become stronger and if we choose the opposite which is Comfort it would instead lead to mediocracy and stagnation so much of mishima's ideas in Sun and seal feels like intuitively grasp ideas of what signs now tell us how some stress is actually more beneficial than none people often look at me as someone who's achieved a certain amount of success so why not just kick my feet back and relax fully and while my priorities have changed in the process of pain I find fulfillment there's a poem at the end of sun and steel called Icarus where Mishima splits his two contrasting thoughts uh in the poem this idea of descend ascending and still remaining grounded why still should the Lust For Ascension seem in itself so close to Madness I just felt so much comfort breeding that reflecting on this week where I tried to train like Mishima I felt a Solitude in my efforts and I think that's why I got weirdly emotional here I didn't expect it I gained an improved grasp on the balance between body and mind and it started as a nice refresher I hope if you were inspired you will embrace the Sun and reach higher but also ground yourself through the steel,unknown

3CqDamkcXPk,"[Music] okay K Felix you know when uh strangers start small talking with you they get in there they ask you questions so Ken what do you do for 11 are you YouTuber look I'm never going to see you again in my life though I really have to tell you my live story you complete stranger go Le leave me alone I don't want to tell you st asking me questions I am a YouTuber yeah but I'm not that kind of YouTuber okay YouTubers they're the worst we know because we are YouTubers YouTubers ruin everything and right now Ken YouTubers are ruining Japan no not Japan it was the Holy Land the holy land so this all started of course with Logan Palm now it's become an infestation all these YouTubers are coming trying to be as obnoxious as possible get a bunch of attention get a bunch of hit clicks bing bada boom bada B and now Ken it's come so far that Japan is actually starting to take action the military of Japan did a drill where they simulated a bunch of YouTubers driving into their military base to live stream the camera I like the look around like what did I do wrong I didn't do anything yes arrest him yeah yeah get that YouTuber they got they've never cleaned anything I just couldn't believe it I thought it was like an actual YouTuber first and I'm like wait a minute no no no it's just a anti-terrorism YouTubers are terrorists according to Japan and and they're not that far off that's the thing they're not even that far off sorry to interrupt the video there's something I wanted to tell you guys there's a gfuel BOGO sale yes BOGO what does it mean I don't know but you buy one you get one hooray there's also a new PewDiePie anime addiction tub beautiful look at that so so good this is one of my favorite looking ones so far don't miss out on this one anime anime Ane I love gfuel so much it's clean energy gives you laser focus zero sugar zero crash zero what did I write zero stir anyway use code PewDiePie Link in the description thanks for watching so recently I think I even saw you did a video on it cuz there was a bunch of YouTubers doing all this like crazy stuff in Japan when it first came out like I didn't want to cover it cuz I just thought like you just giving them more attention don't talk about it leave them alone let them be idiots but now Japan like this is starting to take actual action against the sort of things the most recent thing is this U Mount Fuji blocking view I I did see something about this but I didn't understand what was going on really in Japan they have these cominis and there's Lawson which is like iconic for Japan and then you have man Fuji here in the background beautiful shot people love it you get man Fuji you get the LW in you stand in front you go like look nice entertain I saw someone else do this exact photo so I have to do the exact same thing because I am unique me that's YouTubers you know you see someone else make a video the only thing that can make that video better I realized as I was making fun of it yeah God it's the hardest part of being a YouTuber is when you copy someone's video and then you got to title it and you're like but they got such a good title God how can I make it unique in mine [Â __Â ] you got the good title already but my thumbnail is better click on mine I've been to this Austin by mistake we were staying at our Airbnb nearby and I was like why why are the people on the other side of the road taking pictures of a Lawson and then it hit me I'm like oh I'm at that Lawson oh I should probably I had that feeling Ken I had the thought I was like oh I should take a photo and then I saw there was no crosswalk and you can't jaywalk in Japan that's like murder practically so I was just like a I'll take it tomorrow next day super overcast can't see I'm like God damn it and now they're putting up a big cover so people can't take photos of it cuz people are blocking too much out Ro godamn yeah I never heard of that like blocking the view of a natural element I love this by the look how many people JW you can't do that look at the guy your Airbnb no there would never be me I love the guy with the lightsaber these are everywhere in Japan trying to direct people he's trying to stop him like don't do it you look at these idiots it's overcast they're still taking the photo you can't see it you can't see M Fuji why are you taking the photo what are you trying to accomplish anyway I didn't think I would get this worked up over the start it is really frustrating cuz like for a lot of people Japan is an escape of this bad behavior that's just done in public a lot of times not saying the whole world is like terrible but you know Japan is generally seen as more polite and therefore people want to protect them it's always frustrating to see this but of course there's going to be people that want to take advantage of that which is this YouTuber uh which we will not name and I'll blur his face cuz it's not worth anyone's time he's a terrorist he's a terrorist still ridicule his goal was to travel all across Japan without paying any money and none of it makes any sense he's just clearly here just to piss people off so he enters his bus for any money I think in Japan people pay when they go out of the bus it's time to go down so off yes 680 yeah 6 only this 80 no no 80 no police no no on police station 8 yeah police call the police I like the this guy I like this guy a lot 18 Yen police absolutely based I mean yeah he went on clearly like not wanting to pay how the does he not have that by the way 18 Yen there's no way he doesn't have that he's just like refusing to pay for drama that has to be it there's just no way what she's saying I think I got in trouble guys I don't know what he's saying he spoke English that was English you an idiot dude actually to be fair Japanese people do this to me where they're so shocked that if you speak Japanese they just refuse to understand you God yeah they're like what I get it like I probably say it so badly that they don't get it but at the same time I'm like I know I know just meet me halfway just meet me halfway please I trying to order M flurry God damn it so a lot of words that are Americanized has to fit their I've seen memes of this yeah it's like McFlurry what McFlurry oh yeah yeah so a lot of words just sounds like racist but it's actually how it's said I'm at the drive-thru I'm trying to order mfi and I go murari but they're like eh mfy potato she got got uh murari and they're like they just don't get it I'm like like dessert I ice cream why don't they get it and then I squint it's not murari it's murui and they're like oh M furui oh like God damn it the flri of course and apparently a lot of people I'm not the only one I ask friends and they're like yeah yeah no one the sweet NE the gods believe in the bus and drove me to the police station and now it's time to teach you how yeah he actually drove into the police station number 18 Y which is absolutely true plus like if you're trying to go across Japan you wouldn't go on a bus like he clearly went on a bus to do this it's content man content you got to got to get the content the whole concept of this video is that whoever wins this race gets $10,000 which is such a lie oh yeah yeah me and my buddies are bet this money between each other we'll definitely pay wink wink yeah so he now takes the shansen like the fast train time to teach you how to get the train for free so okay tutorial how to do something for free Ken just don't pay the secret ingredient is crime the thing is you can't enter this area without buying a ticket so he's already lying unless you jump over which I doubt he so he he already lied like he bought a ticket just to fake that he didn't buy a ticket the train and I will find the toilet go straight to the toilet here is the bathroom I would just lock myself look like Le conspicuous as possible no one will ever know what the yeah no no one will suspect me so I came to my destination now I think he is waiting for me outside and I was right he was just waiting to catch me so the only thing I could do is to pretend that I'm sick that's the only thing you could do in that situation not just like buy the ticket when you're in trouble you may be arrested just pretend like you're sick and they'll just let you go oh you're sick you're free to go sir sorry no no English I don't understand if there was a way released me and immediately I started running but he called the police and they are searching for me now then that's how you get stuff for free as long as you can outrun the police I think cuz it's Japan everyone is so nice people like assume it's okay to take advantage almost like they have this idea that oh no one's going to tell me off so it's okay yeah dumb asses they're the ones that are like I can do whatever I want they're so nice dirty yeah exactly like there's something inherently actually racist about that I feel like what I was trying to find like stuff he did in this video cuz they was deleted I found this uh Japanese news one where he gets dubbed and they do him way too nicely like they give him this cool anime voice thank you oh man what voice it kind of makes me want to commit a crime yeah maybe you know they had a whole press conference about this guy crazy I do appreciate they take it so seriously though the the head of the head of Jr lines even yeah they really took this seriously which they should good what this guy looks like he hasn't slept in months those bags under his eyes man been watching all the footage and God I hate these these terrorists he just said this is really annoying basically in the politest way so yeah that's what his little scheme was I got a question yeah like the ones that I keep seeing are like our english- speaking content creators what about like the the Japanese content creators how how are they oh there are there are a couple yeah yeah yeah it's not that's fair actually there was a sha mattress incident you got ARR it this Japanese YouTuber put a mattress in Shibuya Crossing square like the most busiest place on the planet yeah I mean this was just a bit silly I don't I don't know I think it's funny there was a big like huge drama here because people like mix the soy sauce with your chopsticks or something like they did something like slightly unsanitary and J Japan just like L well you're not supposed to teror they called it it's noing matter oh so he pushed his Chopsticks into the common use container directly into his mouth his own Chopsticks contamination you're supposed to use the thong thing Sushi terrorism this Behavior has become known as suor oh I love that they're terrorists oh my God it's the best word it's the best description I've ever heard which I I get it's gross like yeah don't obviously don't do that the last guy everyone's talked about this idiot I'll just blur him and not talk about him but it's still worth seeing the footage cuz he's such an idiot he's all you need to know is he's a kick streamer I should tell you everything there is you need to know I am a sociopath there's like bothering people in the Subway and then what this Asian looking guy shows up you know where I'm from where you from I'm from uh America you're from America yes so am I you're from America yeah you're being obnoxious you know what we do to you what do you do we will do again do what Nagasaki you understand do you think I'm Japanese where are you from I'm from America where are you from Texas bu I love this guy Texas Bud ye mother I'm glad I'm glad other tourist are standing up and idiot down following such an idiot so he broke into this uh from Japan now and they kick him out for good yeah he they kicked him out yeah Japan has you know 99% conviction rate so wow you get caught you're you're done that's the thing like Japan is nice but if you [Â __Â ] around you're done so he broke into one of the construction SES and when told to leave he kept saying Fukushima Fukushima which was the nuclear accident which occurred in 2011 mad bro he's getting activated dog check fim Fukushima Fukushima hey Fukushima fima so funny too so painful oh brother this guy St this is what gotam arrest said cuz they Japan takes trespassing very seriously so yeah a bunch of police showed up because of this they're so polite even though like he's being arrested security Che Security check what the wait why you take a photo of me I like how we ask why they're taking photos of him he's you're liveing the classic content creator defense what's happening I'm so a figing ignorance I have no idea what's going on all of a sudden I'm a victim he loves it he loves it this is his content I don't well I don't want to empty my bag into there why I just look you're going to jail put your stuff in here this [Laughter] is yo this is crazy G minut this is being so nice to him like this not deserve it acting like I'm a terrorist or something there you go they said it he is an actual ter but he's been yelling Fukushima Nagasaki we will do it again and it was like I can't believe they actually treat me like I'm a terrorist or some kind this is crazy why would they think that anyway Bob Japan Jesus Christ dude yeah so he got arrested now he got deported I don't know if he's banned for life or anything like that but I think it would be really difficult for him to enter again which is good get him out I watch his channel and he barely has like any views now I never never agree with this cuz people always say any publicity is good publicity that's a lie if I could take back all of it 100% give me a time machine right now I'll be the best boy ever you know what I mean it's not worth it it's not going to be worth it you're not going to grow your channel you're just going to make everyone hate you and you'll regret it don't be an idiot better yet teror all right check Canen if you enjoy this video we make video together sometime can cover stuff like this probably oh yeah probably what do you mean you don't know it's been great what would you want to be in future yes you uh I would like to I would I

but I forgot for some reason and I just like Americanized it so I was like do you have a parly and they're like what the [Â __Â ] what's what the [Â __Â ] is no a parly it sounds good to me it sound like no it's a parly you don't know what the parly is the thing that helps for water Splish Splash parly moving on should I cry [Laughter] now I knew I knew exactly where that was going oh she's watching got to act like a baby obviously like babies that move all over the place they're sporadic they're going to bump sometimes and there me and my are desperately trying to not like make it a thing right you don't want to teach the baby that to cry as soon as something happens but it's so funny cuz we're also both brazing oursel anytime to be like what's going to happen anything could happen and clearly even the I guess just babies really make me laugh now I can't believe it that's a good meme Maria well done see this is already better than what I had planned girls after buying a $2,000 PC that has the power of a space station I think I actually am the one that sent this one to Mar this is the best purchase I've ever made yeah Mar is always Mac I got her the steam deck right and she's like cool can I play Sims on it I'm like no actually it will probably sign girls are simple they just want to play Sims but they also don't want to play Sims they just want to create characters in Sims that's what I've learned all right the next owners are going to be so confused 2005 2010 it's shrinking no no [Laughter] [Music] he was kind to herself because I think they're lower

I didn't know Mar was on the [Â __Â ] posting meme Pages what the H what the [Â __Â ] is this making direct eye contact with the cabin crew during safety D so and your attention is essential as this may be different from we will now demonstrate the safety features of this is this isit willon and your attention is essential as cabin crew pet I do it because lots of people are not paying attention I feel guilty for the cabin crew they don't give a [Â __Â ] right can we get a confirmation by the the flight attendant do you give a [Â __Â ] I would prefer if people didn't want if I had to do the whole as a cabin crew person we appreciate that especially when most of the time no one is paying attention why would you care [Â __Â ] that no why would you care if you crash we're all going to die it doesn't matter it's a weird charade when he says he's had a good day but how could it be a good day when [Music] maybe that's why no it's good day because I'm finally home that's why it's literally a good day if I had a good bouldering session that's and hey it could have been a great day if you were with me cute though weird things all 90s kid did when they were born the first one absolutely and I always regret it right no no I never did that what the [Â __Â ] this one absolutely yes another one you always regret cuz it completely [Â __Â ] the pen up yes no we never had those I did that but uh the guy version heck I I am still indulge you know yeah yes but I did it over my mouth and pretended I was Bane even before Bane was a thing what is this no I don't think I did that no I didn't I'm not a paramania I did not do that jump the last steps [Laughter] yeah wait there's more no oh yes of course got to have my little sheepy weird '90s kids I'm sure this can't just be a '90s kid thing what would be the current equivalent me using my six phones at the same time so weird no social media yet there were still Trends and everyone across the country followed just what it's kind of weird when you think about it it's kind of like those those weird lies like how if you swallow chewing gum it would stay in your stomach for 7even years like we all heard it but there was no social media how the [Â __Â ] did everyone know that and why the [Â __Â ] did everyone believe it that's so stupid I never believ the gum thing nuh-uh I did believe the crossing eye thing though but feeling cute might [Â __Â ] up my back later every goddamn time they don't tell you they don't tell you they say hey get a kid it'll be fun they don't tell you they [Â __Â ] up their back every goddamn time can't you just poop like normal why do you have to make it go everywhere Me and Mar even have a song uh shut up my back I shut up my back I shut up my back shut up my back I shut up my back every day at least once b sing said for us yo what's your best pickup line my what your best pickup line [Music] there what's your best pick up line your best pickup I'll never be that cool I'll never be that they walking away I feel like a lot of these like oh random person on the street like I feel like 90% of shorts are just fake but that one felt real and I think that's what made it funny I believe it one of these people is regarded as one of the most attractive in the world and the other one is a least but for one brief Shining Moment they looked exactly alike that's Steve bami and I forgot her name Angelina Julie that's right okay me and Mara have this thing where she thinks like really handsome people are super men you know the guy from bear James Allen beautiful man gorgeous she's like no he's he's me I'm like but what am I then if he's not beautiful what am I and then she goes oh I like I like Steve Bushi I'm like what the [Â __Â ] do you see in me then am I do I look like steami hot days like this is perfect for refreshing Italian bbba tea oh my God I want to die thank you [Laughter] inside any dog owner can relate to this like but you know what I mean you know what I mean you come here you [Â __Â ] freeze up and look that's pretty good m m got taste man I gotta say my wife got taste B my wife wondering where she got a bruise weird bruise on my elbow I don't even know where it came from isn't that weird yeah much always has bruises and she's also extremely clumsy so that makes sense it's her thing maybe women bruise easier I don't know my subtitles I can't hear without my subtitles yes how El are you going to eat and watch at the same time I remember like in UK when I put on subtitles for some British friends they were like that's so funny like what the [Â __Â ] we were talking over the whole movie how the hell am I supposed I'm glad subtitles is getting normalized we need always subtitles I guess there was a time where you actually have to listen baby pretends dad Nail clipping hurts her better [Laughter] so cute it's [Laughter] better so that is adorable I love it pun I guess all babies do this but this is more playful cuz yesterday in the bath be we took away be Tory and he went checking if we see him and then go manipulative little demons nobody my teething in infant at 300 in the morning [Music] so that's why they do it B does it all the [Music] [Laughter] time yeah and then other people go like why is he doing that I'm like I who you beats me me taking talking about personality I Meed for my dog he's he's gay but he he has a special connection to classical music there's many things that are interesting we always give personalities to our dogs and we kind of do the same to be but it's so weird because be will have an actual personality one day he will actually speak and we don't have to do it for him so this is funnier if you know a little bit about it so in Japan is Japan is separated into prefectures and every prefecture has their own mayor that has their own like specialty food and all these things that set sets it apart I don't know if all have it but they generally all have mascots so chean this one was was a Masa but got banned because she was too unhinged so this is the banned prefecture masc and they just keep posting even though they're they've been banished from the P prefecture they're not officially recognized nice anymore so definitely go follow chean it's [Â __Â ] hilarious poor chean just like got disowned by its own prefecture calculating how many times mom has blame teething for my bad mood versus how many teeth I actually it's me who does this oh maybe he's just teething oh my [Â __Â ] God all right just a few more uh I want to show you guys these are my memes actually I'll just save them for another time cuz memes are always fun thank you guys for watching thank you much for doing this uh playlist for me check out nordvpn special offer and I'll see you guys in the next

time I'm doing this now all right let me change and I'll perform for bur and you guys we all have our quirks mine is learning dumb and useless things but quirks can be kind of like a superp power that's why I'm hyped for this new g-fuel collab my hero Academia and let me tell you it's more than a flavor it's a whole damn experience check out this lunch box it comes with stainless steel shakar

responsible parent first wear protection I can't do I can't do there's no way I can do it all right check this out be huh I'm trying to hit the thing oh all the way from here I don't want to hit [Music] him okay this one it's called the energy beam you just do from one hand to another you can do high to low and then you can do up and down check this out oh it goes like a skipping rope yeah do you know how much I practice for this stupid move it's not even that cool this wasn't worth it at all all right we'll check this out then you go from one hand to another huh and then like that ooh did

fell off send them the slinky video and know it'll be like excuse me did you see he mastered Slinky bending I don't think so oh I forgot one trck this one's really cool you can hit it on the ground right but instead you hit it on the foot or your knee okay all right so that was fun I love learning new things no matter what it is but I always ask myself like why beating bloodborne without dying or spinning a Frisbie or Slinky what like what's the point uh but I think besides the obvious one of it it just being fun I think it no matter what you teach yourself the best skill that I've learned from doing different things is the confidence of knowing that if I put in the time eventually I will get it and there's something very powerful uh about having that confidence so I think no matter what you learn stick with it even if it seems kind of pointless at least for a little bit I think having that confidence to knowing I can do it is one of the most valuable skills of all so Slinky as fun as it is I might just be slinked out that's it for this video Slinky brist hold up I'm calling you I'm calling you hold up ha I have your IP address now I know exactly where you live I know you've

but I have not streamed like publicly for a long time is this public yes uh I guess like I don't know I get a little feels a bit yeah I guess I'll just admit it I get overwhelmed streaming in front of a lar extra group so if it's just members I find it a lot more um digestible to be honest and uh I also feel bad that I haven't done anything for members because it's just kind of been there so I think it's like a way to do it I think some people get a little bit like why do why only members but it's like yeah just happens to be that way sometimes anyway um yeah I'm streaming early for once

young kids and I was like do you game with them and he's like yeah I play Paw Patrol with them I'm like cool can't wait to play that with be and Roblox yeah yeah I guess Roblox is kind of all right I'll I'll play Roblox it but as soon as he ask for skins no more gaming which of the dogs does BJ love more that's such a weird question but I actually have an answer he thinks Momo is hilarious like he looks at Momo and he goes but he loves to touch Iggy like I don't know ask him B surfing when like that's the real questions I'm wearing contact lenses and I feel like I still can't read let me pop out the chat and make it ler gaming with your kids is so fun okay that's fun yeah I can't wait for that kind of stuff but you know YN is only eight months old one time in his life so I want to enjoy that but yeah we're going to play alone in the dark I hear it's good I'm really glad I was kind of worried obviously I did a promotion for the game it was actually last year and uh it was a crazy crazy time you saw maybe you guys remember it from the vogs like we me and Pia kind of teased it but it was crazy uh so I thought we I'll react to the video I made and cuz there's some more stuff I wanted to share on it and then we'll just play the game uh basically last year I think around this time of year Mar was obviously still pregnant then yes timelines how do they work uh but she got I don't know if we ever talked about it but she was in the risk zone of early birth or premature birth so and we just got that announcement as I was about to leave to go on this um uh UK trip for this haunted house thing and I was kind of like what do I do like I can't just leave Maria uh she was fine at the time but it was also she more got the thing where she has she the doctor told her you you can't move like you have to just like sit still uh for two weeks at least and then we can examine again and see if it improved or not so uh yeah we thought about it a lot and I my plan was to go to UK see friends in UK and then go to Sweden and hang out with my family but instead we I just cut it down to like the shortest long trip I've ever had I flew I landed I told I talked about this in the video but I landed at 6 I slept like a couple hours I woke up at midnight and we drove to this set in this creepy house we filmed it I couldn't sleep after I was done at like 3: I think we're done like 3:00 a.m. obviously I was like hyped up on adrenaline after that shoot even though I was exhausted so I couldn't sleep I stayed up and and and then I took a flight like 12 the next day back and I was so  tired at that point I don't think I ever been that tired uh in my entire life like I was so scared I was going to miss the boarding of the flight because I kept I kept going on and off like you know how they always get delayed when boarding I was just sitting there like so tired it was crazy but it was so fun I it was totally the right call to do obviously there was a risk might yet but uh we were I think we were overly cautious if anything like by the time when the time came to it B didn't even want to come out uh so I'm super glad I got to do it uh let's watch the video um is this it let me know if I should turn off the down the volume where's my Bros scared you didn't I if there's one thing you need to know about me is that I don't get scared I don't get scared I have just played too many horror games so th Q Nordic invited me for a real life I'm curious if I'll actually get scared of this alone in the dark game huh how do I pop out the chat what the  happened here I clicked away sorry one sec okay we're back I never I was never scared ever should probably be louder shouldn't name m is good okay good you you got bitched lasagna tattoo it on your ribs all right nice that's crazy all right anyway yeah I used to be scar terrified of video games cuz I was a child but not anymore play the video me not going to happen it this was to celebrate their upcoming game alone in the dark supp me being startled startled how do you say that startled startled what is going on here where am I that's going to be me soon so I left flew all the way from Japan to UK I arrived at 6:00 p.m. I ate you can actually look pretty for once I woke up at midnight and it was time to begin this house was I I everything is like a fever dream for me but I think this was a house like on an island in River tames and I'm not sure how you say that either tames tames and it was such a massive house on an island like usually those are like nice I expected uh super nice house it was a nice house the heart monitors were real yes thanks for asking uh but uh it was so shabby and I was like did they make it shitty cuz the down floor looked really nice I don't understand how did they did it they told me people live in the house I'm just I everything about it is confused so basically they just strapped Us in these GoPros and said hey go in there which is and heartbeat sensors I guess I forgot to say that but yeah it was an actual we look so goddamn awkward we had the Apple Watchers or something like that hello hello thank you for joining us sorry to keep you waiting we are assuming we're we're looking at an item this size I think that guy is like a big name in the gaming industry like he's done a lot of other stuff but I I didn't recognize it to hon it was supposed to be found in this creepy house that is located on an island just to be clear we own this this is ours we got no directions at all no the trouble comes with access to the island developers have locked us out we do not have legal access I I kept watching this with Maria we watched it on onut uncut footage together and I'm like yeah I'm really awkward i't I like oh Sam my thank you so much hey hey from uh do I look awkward you look so polite sitting thank you what I had this thought the other day this is very t on um a tangent but I feel like I'm quite good at understanding people and reading people and get and being sens sensible Sensible yes I might be awkward with how I sit but at least I know how to speak I think cuz people say such dumb shits to me sometime like you're awkward for saying that that's dumb I would never be that dumb real is that we are Urban explorers if you do get caught which is unlikely yes I don't know how to do a handshake okay high social awareness but lower selfawareness high social aware low selfawareness shut shut up shut up Luke something yeah you can just say I'm clearly I can't pause and unpa this video something keeps happening Explorer here's my footage look gets you out of anything I don't know I just thought that was so brilliant cuz it really really put me in feeling emerged we will retrieve the item no doubt about it I have no doubt I am extremely confident all right oh I should mention so PJ and I obviously had the same footage and uh they sent us PJ's edit and they were like PJ's edit is so goddamn good just make it like his I think Cy killed it in the end but like the heart thing and stuff we may have stolen from PJ sorry PG this is great yeah I did not expect to go on a boat yeah yeah he sent us to collect an item this is fil last year treasure apparently yeah he told you about this unfortunate incident I think he called it didn't he yeah it was it was a bit troubling to hear yeah there was a murder on the island you see oh he didn't he didn't say if you're wondering why I'm not speaking here it's cuz I'm completely zoned out I think my brain just went I'm on a boat luckily pet did took over the murder in the house so I'll show you okay I don't know when people are acting I find it hard to understand what they're saying because I'm like oh you're just acting I don't want to listen to you hid coming in with us you're not coming in with this through the double doors all right through the double doors up you go thank you all right well take care we did not know we were filmed here it's kind of cool to see it in hindsight you go ahead as a little bit of a survival horror expert always make your partner or whatever go first I don't understand why they always just don't right what we looking for the last time I saw person uh yeah it it was really cool it was not obvious how we were going to get into the house like we had this alleyway going here and then there was a scaffolding there and uh as you guys know I hate U UK scaffolding but it was not obvious that we were going to go there so it felt really cool that sub it wasn't obvious for to go but it was still kind of clear you know what I mean you step this is like a parkour okay we can enter there I think the window's open like when we shot I I'm going to talk a lot about scar PewDiePie I feel like but when we shot that I don't want to down talk it because I think I think season 2 on rest in peace had so much potential and we had so much fun filming it too but I think yeah one of the main issues was like people had so many cameras and sometimes they was like okay um like they they don't tell me anything and I don't know what's going to happen but as soon as we start shooting they're like okay stand here oh actually we need to reset wait here and then it's like I can see what's going on in the back and everything and it's just like and then it's like re and it just felt more like acting sometimes I don't know this is actually just having fun into the I did you just say something Felix no we made it I genuinely felt like we were breaking into before as you may know but those were huge Productions I don't know was PJ that stressed out his heartbeat so much he kind of of it this genuinely felt like me and PJ we're Urban explorers and we're breaking into this house okay absolutely I'm chilling here over at 88 the whole time I think my resting heartbeat is usually around 65 so you're not going in there all right take note of everything you see is this nailed down to the floor what are you you're Che that's F actually we should bring that around and keep pluging it in just it did feel like they clearly set this up as a as like a game thing but it was fun for us to try to find exploits like moving the lamp around I don't think they thought about us doing that uh and it kind of feels like that in video games a lot of times like you always test what you can do so it's kind of the same thing also clear okay it looks oh there's a door here okay wait sh sh did you hear that no oh what what about like under the floorboards okay whoa that's so cool oh oh go you hear stuff right that's creepy that's a beast genuinely creepy be that is a beast that's a be is Beast oh it works so what's this I was thinking like maybe it' be more scary if I'm alone but at the same time seen you buddy but I think I would be more scared that I wouldn't sold the puzles if I was hello oh sorry we almost didn't see them it was so funny right Birds maybe we need to free the birds hear me out open the window fre the birds the store Long yeah oh oh okay oh oh that's a bit witchy I guess you can't also really see it but that's the Beast he watches it was generally so dark that's fresh not this room but if we didn't have the flashlight it was like pitch black room maybe were like we look more freaked out then he's been eating corn he's been eating this is fresh corn that's fresh corn PJ so will was the person that lived in this house and we found out more about him most importantly we found out that will is in fact a game what we can understand is he's why were there Birds I think it's something in the video game I think it was in the original alone in the- dark game but I'm not entirely sure there was something about a bird cage living off of a DI of corn how much dumb and clueless moment did you cut we didn't cut many dumb clueless moments because I think we me and pet actually I think there was like a dozen people that did this whole thing and me and Pia were the fastest ones so uh yeah yeah only it could be apple juice it could be apple juice but I you know there's only one way to find out there is only one way to find out I wonder if anyone else actually tried to drink it no I'm not going to yeah definitely piss definitely was it I don't know we did not drink it some Clues here top floor safe shame the the shame room me and P were making really good progress we were in fact so good at making progress we solved puzzles without even meaning to yeah oh a that's such a certified PewDiePie moment stumbling upon the puzzles you kidding me New Year's Eve last night I watched the funerals from funerals plural funerals fireworks fireworks from yeah why would be a funeral on who would it was hard to read that it  curs handwriting all I have left now is sweet corn I hate sweet corn okay do you want to open this creepy little dog usually text stuff isn't fun to read but that was actually funny the ghost make yourself bigger than the ghost like like oh Jesus are you scared me all right we need to get into this room we have a torch now yes are you I'm not doing anything okay what was that it's low battery torch is low battery are you sure see that room was dark come on are you kidding I'm not me and P I don't remember if I said this in the video but we around a lot and I think it when we saw the flashlight yeah the flashlight was remote control but it didn't look like it was it looked like a normal flashlight so it didn't hit me at the time uh I genuinely thought oh we around too much and we're running out of battery uh so yeah they probably mess with it definitely I I could tell when we were in the Seance room cuz the timing was too good but all right we okay what this tells me is we need to move a bit Qui yeah it was like a lingering kind of worrying just ma shine yeah worry that the flashlight went out do you have to press play there yeah nice okay okay okay oh is that oh oh thaty wants to be him I think this dudney is a friend and I think we can be that friend I don't want to be friends with this nak creep what are you on about okay he jump he jumped in the middle I asked if anyone else got naked for the dance and yeah apparently someone [Music] did where's he going guess I'm not that committed okay the is that the thing is that The Medallion The Medallion okay oh great and then presumably he took the recording he sort of like he printed it to VHS and he wrote shame on it wait Did he just stash the key in the doorame I think so yeah which door frame was it over here I think sh sh we could keep hearing stuff downstairs but I mean there was 100 people on this set so it's not that has an ice machine I think pretty sure it's one of those fridges that have an ice maker in it yeah there we go I KCK the crate no chicken popped out is that a reference made I didn't get it the record I don't want to go in here we have to but I think we have to we're Urban explorers after going oh excellent I might cut ahead a little bit cuz uh I want to alsoa it's a summoning room play the game all right sneaky sneaky saky sneaky Sak that's this room is it a dolly room so cool little I don't think you can really see all the dolls moving which is such a shame cuz it was really weird I was not expecting them all to  move the little dollhous yeah yeah leave this to me I know little doll houses I've been playing with these how do you know this freak me out dude we kept we kept being worried that someone's going to sneak up on us I don't know why that was like my biggest concern I was always like closing the doors goodidea trying to block them up get a little since I moved that box I think there was a knife from someone on production that actually lost it and I just got it I was like  what do I do with I don't want to have this knife what am I supposed to stab [Music] someone is that you cry yes God damn it they're moving Look Under the Bed there was a doll moving under the bed it was so creepy I couldn't see it before no what do we do I don't know I shouldn't have touch the door touch the door I hate why is YouTube's so ass all right whatever it doesn't matter all right s's time it's moving Sarah are you in this room with us right now can you answer that W she's saying yes Sarah we need to get out can you help us please and don't say no say yes don't say no yeah this is s all right yes good uh Sarah are you a gamer that is not an option they told me they were laughing their asses off in the in their production room no no no okay not a gamer you want be a g so bad where is the key sir H he he heed head head head sorry head doll head is it in the doll head I wanted to just smash the I think that was a scared PewDiePie moment where I was like yeah I know exactly what they want us to do I think there was a hammer on the table but I didn't see it someone told me there was a hammer we were supposed to smash it with uh yeah I I just knew and pety was like is it okay can we do it I'm just like dude they just want us to smash It smash it really yes Grandma can you confirm am I okay to smash it's a weird sentence PJ kind of s don't smash Grandma smash oh Jesus this is horrible psychopath versus empathy gang he was like this is so horrible why is it fast forward now I didn't click anything this is so bad we're outside we're on the outside if we can just run it jump into the Greg what's his name Greg George George if you keep getting his name wrong he's not going to come back for us George head you can make that jump you think I don't know why I was so obsessed trying to think okay if this was real like how would I actually Escape I would just jump over there it was really tall by the way I would definitely get hurt and break my legs but I would have jumped I would have just jumped for the record if I'm not the one that dies in The Haunted House it ain't going to be me just jump out uh I don't know yeah that's where my brain always goes we should find the safer way there you see I can make that gem probably not it's pretty [Music]  really see I'm still going I think if I really could have I think we could jump here PJ break the game dude they would freak out if we triy to jump JP right this is really creepy I don't think it showed but the thing inside the casket moved a lot it's a shame we didn't get that on footage it was really creepy like they built clearly built this thing from based on the game and I think it was so cool like the what is it called the props or art Department  killed it also like this is such a fancy room you see what I mean with like being confused if this is like a nice place or a horrible place um I'm cutting ahead just because um I want to play the game I saw something there but I I definitely did see something clearly see him moving there I mean let's investigate you know this is the moment I got the most scared in the whole thing and I I I remember I couldn't wait to see what my heart rate was and it just didn't move it just stays the same I was like oh for sure it's got to be high that that moment 93 this is what I'm okay 105 there you go he kept going for me see this only works periodically get ready to run back the oh God I'm not ready we kept feeling like something would sneak up on us like going down I was like just go PJ just  go stop hesitating I'm going I'm going I'm going well this is no better this is this is is p okay I don't know PD is really fit too like uh he's a he's a healthy boy I don't know godamn we have power he's got a fast heart I guess yes good all right a goes into B it's a shame we didn't get a better shot of the heart it looked like a ball sack it was really cool how they did it okay [Music] okay we're going to blast oh cuz it was like slowly falling apart too I don't know how they did it you can't see it it was really [Music] fun and then we did it I don't know where the exit is [Music] [Applause] PJ I couldn't believe how many people were behind this thing it's crazy as my manager see managers [Music] it we did it I genuinely had such a yeah so fun all right let's play the game all started now starting the game thank you th nor dick for that amazing experience honestly like I'll never forget it it was so fun and I don't know who exactly set the whole thing up but also huge thank you like yeah honestly memory for life for sure like stuff like that I'm just so so lucky to be able to do okay is this the game yes let me know if the game is too loud or too low how's [Music] that I should have had a heartbeat sensor for this now how's that count of loud okay now how's this better okay uh I think normally I would pick hard but I have not gamed in so long I think I almost want to do easy but I'll do standard uh extra help provided to make experence smoother and easier including hints and helpful for those who want to figure out everything for himself no extra system so they basically if you're dumb or a dummy dumb uh I think I think hints usually piss me off but but I also just want a smooth experience when I'm streaming so yeah it's slippy No Sleep me see yeah this is a super old game for I think PlayStation uh one I wanted to play it back in the day when I played a lot of horror games it was on my list so this is a remake obviously or uh maybe is that what it's called this game inspired the Resident Evil series so it's like old school old school 1992 yeah thank you what's wrong with it he's possessed as in the devil is that that actor something like that from stranger things he says a dark man is following him watching him at all times sorry what are you making really looks like him it's nonsense of course but I'd be lying if I said it didn't bother me you see it runs in my family possession no detective deteriorating Mel we got a detective story eh practically every member of thewood family I would be the guy with the hat and PJ would be the girl cuz I'm manlier just but Jeremy didn't kill himself is that why he's at just set up despite being convinced that he is truly possessed he decided to put his last chips on Dr Gray and his psychoanalysis that car is not going to make I'm calling it right now I sneezed the other day like a normal sneeze but it made be cry it was so [Music] funny I received a disturbing letter from Jeremy accusing the staff and all the other patients of being involved in some cult and now they are also out to get him I thought there were Ur an explorers there's it all just in his head it's a story he it is David Harbour no way anything to avoid the truth which is that were all terribly insignificant that people mean so very little to one another that there is no one out to get Jeremy Hartwood because he isn't worth getting here we are damn this really looks like um the last Resident Evil I played are the family one with all the uh Greenery not the house my uncle's not well Mr kby I want to make sure he's all right then what's my part in this you couldn't get a cab I just wouldn't feel safe going alone okay did you bring a gun yeah B is right there it's right there how do you not see it but you might need to wave it around depending on how agreeable the staff will be he's clearly already waving it around it's right there find Jeremy I don't you should put it on his forehead let's just find him first do I get to play now is this the one when I get to playing oh well I'm going to be David Harbor no it is David Harbor no way so she must be an actress too then jod kummer that can't be a real name all right uh [Music] David bye bye so you can play these two players I think I wanted to play with PJ but it was too difficult to set up with that timing am I moving I'm not okay hello hello she's from killing eeve the main character there has to be someone around it doesn't is it really her wait here I'll go around [Music] back ah chapter one it begins okay video games we're video gaming uh I'm just going to find my way in so I'm just going to speedrun this it is tempting to

good way to learn practice I uh yeah I was going to buy a bunch of art books cuz I thought like that would be a good way to support artists and also a good way for me to get referen uh and I found

_flqrzcGhrE,where's my Bros scared you didn't I if there's one thing you need to know about me is that I don't get scared I have just played too many horror games so THQ Nordic invited me for a real life haunted house experience to try and spook me not going to happen it this was to celebrate their upcoming game alone in the dark what is going on here where am I so I left flew all the way from Japan to UK I arrived at 6:00 p.m. I ate I slept then I woke up at midnight and it was time to begin so basically they just trapped Us in these GoPros and said hey go in there which is why when we walked in we looked so goddamn awkward hello hello thank you for joining us sorry to keep you waiting we are assuming we're we're looking at an item this size uh uh so thick uh gold in color uh and probably in material as well so our objective was to retrieve this golden medallion it was supposed to be found in this creepy house that is located on an island just to be clear we own this this is ours okay there's no question about that the trouble comes with access to the Island developers have locked us out we do not have legal access to the island so he told us that we are Urban explorers if you do get caught which is unlikely that the company y cool you can just say I'm an Urban Explorer here's my footage look gets you out of anything I don't know I just thought that was so brilliant cuz it really really put me in feeling immersed we will retrieve the item no doubt about it I have no doubts I am extremely confident all right go guess we're going on a vote ride this is great yeah was that boy from insurance company was he yeah yeah yeah he sent us to collect uh an item treasure treasure apparently yeah yeah he told you about this unfortunate incident I think he called it didn't he yeah it was it was a bit troubling to hear yeah there was a murder on the island you see oh didn't he didn't say I didn't I don't remember hearing the word murder no a murder in the house so I'll show you okay which way he went in all right I'm not going any further in the that I don't you coming in with us the stairs is through the double doors all right through the double doors up you go thank you all right well take care see you in a couple hours you might do p you go ahead as a little bit of a survival horror expert always make your partner or whatever go first I don't understand why they always just don't right what we looking for here what was it an amulet what was it Egyptian amulet okay that's gal sign and that's locked this door is locked dude this is cool got to be bald what you step this is like a parkour yeah okay we can enter there I think the window's open okay D into the W I did you just say something felixs no we made it I genuinely felt like we were breaking into someone's house I've done these sort of uh things before as you may know but those were huge Productions there were people with huge cameras everywhere you looked and it kind of takes you out of it this genuinely felt like me and PJ we're Urban explorers and we're breaking into this house okay absolutely not going in there all right take note of everything you see is this nailed down to the floor what are you you're cheating that's smart actually we should bring that around and keep plugging it in just trying to get I think this room is also clear okay it looks oh there's a door here okay wait sh sh did you hear that no oh what what about like under the floorboards okay wa that's so cool oh oh W oh you hear stuff right that's a beast he didn't tell us to be that he's a beast that's a beast oh it works so what's this will was here 7 years ago yeah we know you don't want to see you buddy but oh CH oh they hello oh sorry I oh H is choing hello right Birds maybe we need to

person that lived in this house and we found out more about him most importantly we' found out that will is in fact a gamer what we can understand is he's predominantly living off of a diet of corn Dam and uh I can only presume that this is piss well you can only it could be apple juice it could be apple juice but I you know there's only one way to find out there is only one way to find out down the hatch no I'm not going to yeah definitely pissed definitely all right can we maybe find some Clues here top floor sa shame the the shame room me and P were making really good progress we were in
