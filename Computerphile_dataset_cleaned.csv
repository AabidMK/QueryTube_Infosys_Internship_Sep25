hmvcLCT9E6k,Computing & Radar Displays - Computerphile,"Not enough just to crunch numbers in Air Traffic Control, you have to be able to display those numbers. John Linfield takes us through the kit.

Corrective Comment: The Sony 2K monitors, as used at Swanwick/Prestwick, are not vector graphics displays. The PDP11/34s were more than a 'graphics card' they were Radar Display Processors which handled selection of the required radar data streams from the 12 odd available and also handled the inputs from the various control panels on the controller suite. The 11/34s originally drove as Sector Equipment Group which converted the digital data to vector data to drive the original displays, once the Ericsson displays where introduced they had the SEG functionality built in and were therefore driven directly by the 11/34.

tlS5Y2vm02c,Holy Grail of AI (Artificial Intelligence) - Computerphile,"Audible free book: http://www.audible.com/computerphile 
Why can't artificial intelligence do what humans can? Rob Miles talks about generality in intelligence.

Sean Comments/Questions (For those who can't hear him clearly)
11secs: ""This was the hill climbing algorithm?""
2min 40sec: ""recently with Professor Brailsford we did the idea of The Turing Test, so that strikes me from what you're saying that that's a very specific domain: pretending to be a human talking?""
4min 2sec: ""is that like 'humans have been changing the world to meet their needs?' ""
4min 40sec: ""but on a bigger scale, as you say on a grander scale, building a dam, and er irrigating a field, and putting a pipe to your house and allowing you to have a tap {fawcett} is doing the same thing but on a grander scale.""
6min 39sec: ""all these dimensions, if you try to brute force infinite dimensions you're gonna fall over pretty quickly?""
6min 45sec: ""change the world"" (in ref to him picking up the drink!)

nsZsd5qtbo4,Undecidability Tangent (History of Undecidability Part 1) - Computerphile,"What was the first undecidable problem? Professor Brailsford takes us on a computerphile tangent & gives us his angle on a pre-computer example of undecidability.

Note from Professor Brailsford: a couple of corrections for this film:
1/ ""... early 18th Century"" for Gauss should be "" ... early 19th century"" 
2/ ""... 100 years ago"" for Newton should be ""... 100 years before Gauss

3/ The Greek word I was struggling with was ""Boeotians"". I have now taken expert advice which tells me that the ""oe"" is pronounced ""ee"" as in ""Oedipus"". Hence a reasonable approximation to the correct pronunciation is ""Bee-oh-shuns""

4/ In my excitement to get the message across I sometimes refer, in the video, to Euclid's 5th axiom being a ""proposition"". However it is more accurately a ""postulate"" i.e. something which should be provable from the other axioms/postulates of the Euclidean system. The fact that it can't be thus proved means that the other axioms are insufficiently powerful to prove it -- hence it is ""undecidable"" within that axiom system.""
