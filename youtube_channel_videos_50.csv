7DKv5H5Frt0,"After ten years, it's time to stop weekly videos.","Find me here: ❓ LATERAL, free weekly podcast: https://lateralcast.com/ https://youtube.com/lateralcast 📰 WEEKLY NEWSLETTER https://www.tomscott.com/newsletter/ 🟥➕ TOM SCOTT PLUS: https://youtube.com/tomscottplus 👥 THE TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES: https://youtube.com/techdif 🟥 MAIN SITE: https://www.tomscott.com/

On January 1st, 2014, I uploaded the first ""Things You Might Not Know"" video. Once the initial rush of videos settled down, I aimed for one video a week, and while there have sometimes been guest videos and occasional blatant filler: to my own satisfaction, I never missed a week. But now, it's time to stop.

I never got to space. I never got to the ocean depths. And I never got to fly off into the sunset, harnessed underneath a helicopter. I couldn't find an excuse for that one.

Oarf76MCrss,Grizzly bear GoPro selfie: raw unedited footage,"This footage is public domain, and the raw files are available at  https://archive.org/details/grizzly-bear-selfie ■ An explanation, which is not public domain: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq4ZkfojSis ■ Two videos taken by grizzly bears at the Grizzy & Wolf Discovery Center, West Yellowstone, Montana. The bears found a previously-lost GoPro Hero 11 in a protective case, in their pond, which had enough battery left to take a couple of brief shots, including a selfie.

As these video files were created entirely by bears, by accident, I believe them to be in the public domain. If that's not the case, then as the owner of the camera and potential copyright holder, I'm happy to license these files under CC0 and dedicate them to the public domain as far as legally possible.

However, if I don't upload them to YouTube first, then someone else will — and YouTube's copyright systems often get confused by public domain footage, so for my own safety, this is the digital equivalent of sending them to myself in a sealed, postmarked envelope.

YouTube's system the license for this listed as ""Creative Commons - Attribution"", because ""Public Domain"" is not an option. You are not required to attribute this footage, but if you do use these files, it'd be nice to make a donation to the Grizzly & Wolf Discovery Center. They've got bears to feed. https://www.grizzlydiscoveryctr.org/

72RxerDwzEo,The cable car that you pedal by hand,"Through the mountains of Slovenia, there are manual cable cars: some historic, some more modern. There aren't many left. I was able to try one, and to talk to the person who still maintains it.

Just to be clear, there are a few of these in other places in the world, too. There's at least a couple in North America, one in Germany, and one in Turkey! (Or at least, I think they still exist.) But the video of the Cicka got me to beautiful Slovenia, and the story that I found there was worth the trip.

Camera: Jamie MacLeod https://www.jamiemacleod.co.uk/
Editor: Michelle Martin https://www.youtube.com/@OnTheCrux

This is not an advert, Catesby Projects and the tunnel team had no editorial control and I wasn't paid. (In fact, I paid quite a bit for the fire safety team!)

Thank you to the many people who suggested this over the years, but in particular to David who was able to put me in touch with them directly!

This isn't an advert! the subject was suggested by the team at 1DaySooner, but that's it: no money changed hands and no editorial control was given away.

Two bonus facts I couldn't fit in the main video:
😷 There are some challenge trials which require stronger quarantine protocols or negative-pressure rooms, but they're much more rare (and much more difficult to film)
🧻 The tissues that volunteers sneeze into have to be put into a separate bag, so they can be weighed

KRIBVykhpC4,"It's the Matrix, but for locusts.","At the Department of Collective Behaviour, part of the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior, researchers are putting locusts into simulated worlds, both virtual and physical, in the hope that they can figure out how devastating swarms form and move. ■ About the Centre: https://www.exc.uni-konstanz.de/collective-behaviour/ https://www.ab.mpg.de/couzin

Edited by Michelle Martin https://www.youtube.com/@OnTheCrux
Thanks to David Walter for the suggestion

This is the most uncomfortable I've ever felt while filming, for a few reasons. First, of course, because of the locust swarm itself. Second, because animal research — even on creatures as simple and pestilent as locusts — always raises ethical questions. Now, the researchers are careful with the locusts, and I don't think many people could have a problem with this. Indeed, most of the world currently has zero ethical restrictions on insect experimentation — but it's still worth interrogating whether this is okay. And finally: because if we can do this so easily to less intelligent creatures... what's to stop something more intelligent coming along and doing the same to us?

I'm a bit worried that this comes across as an advert. It's not — I reached out to the team at GIKEN, they had no editorial control, and no money changed hands. (Although they did, of course, go through all the paperwork required to let me climb into their giant robot parking garage.) They also asked me to include this: “Eco Cycle and Eco Park are brand names of GIKEN LTD. in Japan”, which seemed a reasonable enough request.

AcQifPHcMLE,This 1970s tank simulator drives through a tiny world,"At the Swiss Military Museum in Full, there's the last remaining example of a 1970s tank-driving simulator. But there's no virtual worlds here: it's connected to a real camera and a real miniature model. ■ More about the museum: https://www.festungsmuseum.ch/

Ei6LKHNFpeE,I finally found a useful monorail.,"The Doppelmayr Garaventa Monorack is a decades-old product. I've no idea how I missed it before. But for the third video in the Monorail Trilogy, this isn't an advert: I'm just happy to be proved wrong. ▪ More about the Monorack: https://www.doppelmayr.com/products/monorack/

Previously, Wuppertal in 2016: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4KZLcvMQWg (I'm not proud of this video -- the Tim Traveller has done a much better video on the system here, and you should probably watch that instead: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IFh6wFTJiQ )

And the Roadmachines monorail in 2020: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Irv3KJR6B80

(Thanks also to Grotto de Peo in Ronco sopra Ascona. If you're ever in the area, their food is delicious.)
