iq6_iUhLHo4,Binging with Babish: King of the Hill Special,"Peggy Hill is many things: she's a mother. A boggle champ. A substitute teacher (substitute teacher of the year twice, in fact). A sculptor. A foot fetish model. A kidnapper. A survivor of a fall from 13,000 feet without a parachute. The mother of the 15th Dalai Lama. She is by her own admission, however, not a very good cook. Will her specialty dishes make it into the clean plate club?

c_BGPTK3GQk,Binging with Babish: Ziti and Lasagna from The Sopranos,"Rarely does food play such a central character in a TV show or movie that's not specifically about food, but in The Sopranos, it might as well be one of the family.  The crown jewel of which, despite Artie Bucco's hapless attempts, is the cuisine of Carmela Soprano.  Strap on your gold President and build a ramp for the ducks, because it's time to emotionally repress our murderous mentality with some cheesy, saucy pasta - with a layer of basil underneath the cheese, of course.

LyagMC0bokI,Binging with Babish: World's Most Expensive Mc10:35 from Archer,"This week, Sterling Archer strikes again with another overpriced, overindulgent masochistic mash-up: the world's most expensive Mc10:35. A sandwich normally concocted from an egg McMuffin and a McDouble, Archer decides to cobble one together from some otherwise-relatively-thoughtful canapés. Will it live up to the superspy's reputation? Probably.

NWGVFi-213w,Binging with Babish: Four Horsemeals of the Eggporkalypse from Parks & Rec,"This week, we say a bittersweet goodbye to the old BwB studio with a Swanson's swan song, and probably the longest episode name to date: The Four Horsemeals of the Eggporkalypse from Parks & Rec. A fitting goodbye, a breakfast that could comfortably feed a family of four (along with some aunts and uncles), prepared on the very same flat-top that seared the sixteen-some-odd patties flipped in the kitchen's inaugural episode.

ztl0gGVFoK0,"Binging with Babish: Steak, Eggs and Gravy from Twister","Twister did more than make me briefly go through a phase of wanting to be a storm chaser - it showed me that with a durable enough pickup truck, you could easily drive directly through a four-bedroom house. It also made my stomach growl when Aunt Meg busted out the country cooking in her bohemian Oklahoman homestead: ribeyes with fried sunny-side-up eggs, mountains of fluffy mashed potatoes, and a rightfully famous gravy. And homemade lemonade, shit, I forgot the lemonade.

NFAN6L7xnvY,Binging with Babish: Grilled Cheese Deluxe from Regular Show,"This week, for the first time ever, we're double-dipping into the same source material two episodes in a row. Why? Last week was National Grilled Cheese Day, and well damn it, it got me in the mood. So while we don't have any accurate stats or specs on the 'grilled cheese deluxe' from Cheezer's, this is my very best effort to make a grilled cheese worth standing in line for. Unless you're an astronaut, of course.

Z1kR6SIr1XA,Binging with Babish: Crêpes from Talladega Nights,"Tickets on sale now for my book tour!
https://www.bingingwithbabish.com/events

Pre-order my book before its release on October 22nd for access to exclusive content!
https://www.bingingwithbabish.com/cookbook

Crêpes are discussed at length, in a pretty threatening manner, in Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby.  Before his arm is snapped by the very French Jean Girard, he's coerced into admitting he likes crêpes...which he actually does.  Which makes sense, because they're the perfect vessel for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert.

https://youtu.be/YUDogDKMJbE

This week we return, for the first time in 3 years, to the house that built Babish: Parks and Rec.  As summer (eventually) approaches, what could be better than celebrating Swanson-style: by wrapping some meat around some other meat.  There's only one problem: I can't seem to stop using colons in this video's description.

qoHnwOHLiMk,Carbonara | Basics with Babish,"Carbonara has been the subject of some severe bastardization here in the states, where we regularly eschew Italian tradition in favor of garlic, bacon, and green peas for some reason.  Today we're doing both the old-school and illegitimate versions of the hotly-contested dish, both of which deserve their place in your grandmother's handwritten recipe cards.

rBYd_O38Ncw,Binging with Babish: Judy the Elf's Hot Cocoa from The Santa Clause,"In a Klingon-like transfer of power ritual, the conveniently-initialed Scott Calvin kills Santa Clause in front of his son, puts on the dead man's clothes, and takes over his role as the bringer of joy to children around the world. Peyote-trip-storyline aside, there's some pretty choice hot cocoa served to the killer by one of his ancient child servants: a recipe perfected for 1200 years. Can we do the same in our home kitchen? Not without creating some potentially explosive, extra chocolatey hazards!

44fjX-rgJ7s,Binging with Babish: Cannoli from The Godfather,"Check out some summer-adventure-recipe-videos I made with Coppola Wine:
https://www.thefamilycoppola.com/en/store/diamondadventure/eat-and-drink

""Leave the gun, take the cannoli"" - is there a more iconic line spoken in Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather?  I mean, apart from almost every other line of dialogue?  In a film defined by its own endless defining moments, food still manages to stand out as a memorable supporting character.  I mean, it wouldn't be much of an Italian mobster film without it.

8q8LsYbDCmM,Binging with Babish: Omelette du Fromage from Dexter's Laboratory,"This episode is sponsored by Butcherbox. New members will get 6 free grass-fed, grass-finished steaks! That’s 2 New York strips and 4 top sirloins added to your first box for free. Click here: http://butcherbox.com/babish

Today, I'm given an excuse to (probably horrendously incorrectly) attempt some French - both the language and cuisine. An iconically challenging but ironically simple dish becomes the sole phrase in Dexter McPherson's normally-stacked vocabulary, the admittedly-seductive-sounding ""omelette du fromage"". Let's crack some eggs!

This week we're channeling the Always Sunny ""milk steak"" as we fancy up an outlandish gastronomic gag from the brilliant and jarring I Think You Should Leave with Tim Robinson. Our hero, who used to be a piece of sh*t, gleefully recalls post-club evenings spent at Truffani's with a big rare cut of beef and a glass of water. Let this be a warning to all film & television creators: if you put food in your thing, I will make it.

98R3fgPKmYs,Binging with Babish: Sweetrolls from Skyrim,"This episode is sponsored by Elder Scrolls Online: Greymoor. Check it out here: https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/joinus

Well folks, after years of requests, they're finally here: the most tempting polygonal pastries ever put to PC, Sweetrolls from Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. I've been terrified to take on this digital dessert for years, but after developing a recipe using a buttery-sweet brioche, I think it's finally ready for the main stage. [Insert joke about stealing sweetrolls here].

2uHhKAjnvNc,Binging with Babish: Freddy's Ribs from House of Cards,"Frank Underwood is many things: A husband.  A politician.  A duplicitous, machiavellian psychosexual deviant with a bloodlust for power.  A purveyor of fine Carolinian barbecue.  Opening just for him at 7:30AM is Freddy's Ribs, a southern barbecue joint that we can surmise is serving 'cue up in the style of Underwood's hometown of Gaffney, South Carolina.  Just in time for Father's Day, here's three different means by which to achieve that genuine Southern barbecue, even from the confines of a 4th-story walkup.

teQmpOtjCjY,Binging with Babish: Spaghetti Tacos from iCarly,"BwB turns 3 this weekend, so it seemed only fitting to take a crack at one of longest and most hotly-requested dishes in the show's history: spaghetti tacos.  I was always hesitant to try, as double-carbing gives me the heebie-jeebies, but I think we've got a satisfying conclusion to man's lifelong journey of incorporating pasta in tacos.

t78IFIYiQ8M,Toaster Strudels from Mean Girls | Binging with Babish,"This episode is sponsored by BetterHelp. Join today and get 10% off your first month: https://betterhelp.com/babish

The year was 1985 - Mikhail Gorbachev became the leader of the Soviet Union, Phil Collins released No Jacket Required, and the Pop-Tart had an utter monopoly on the heat-and-eat breakfast pastry market. Luckily, a man known only as Mr. Wieners created a frozen innovation, the so-called Toaster Strudel: a flakier, fruitier, frostier response to its shelf-stable contemporary. It would go on to partially fund a clique of particularly unkind young women, portrayed in the 2004 biopic “Mean Girls”. Anyway, today we’re making homemade toaster strudels.

ZYvDLT2BkQ8,Good-For-You Pizza | Basics with Babish ft. Ethan Chlebowski,"Thank you to Adobe for sponsoring this video. To try out Lightroom for yourself, click here: https://adobe.ly/2ZJRUUZ

This week, @EthanChlebowski joins us to tackle a question for the ages: just how do you make a guilt-free pizza that also, you know, tastes like pizza? The answer lies in a Roman specialty known as ""Pinsa"": a light, airy, chewy flatbread with fewer calories, more fiber, and more protein than its Neapolitan counterpart. Is it diet food? No. Does it look/taste/feel/smell/sound exactly like the real deal, all while delivering more of the nutrients your body so dearly needs? Yes!

In Quentin Tarantino's latest drug-laced, blood-soaked, profanity-peppered revisionist history masterpiece, food once again takes center stage alongside our singular protagonists. In a departure from his penchant for fictional brand names, a familiar box emblazoned in blue is shown as the preferred dinner of stuntman Cliff Booth. Can we improve on this childhood classic? Is there even a need to? Well, I decided to anyway. Sort of.

Mushroom Bourguignon - Recipe adapted from: https://www.americastestkitchen.com/recipes/12297-mushroom-bourguignon

Mushrooms Bourguignon Ingredients:
8 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
5 pounds portobello mushroom caps, cleaned (if necessary) + quartered + divided
1½ cups pearl onions, divided
1 teaspoon kosher salt + more to taste
½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper + more to taste
⅓ cup all-purpose flour
4 cups vegetable or “not-beef” Stock
1 (750-ml) bottle red wine, divided
2 tablespoons agar-agar flakes
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1 tablespoon white miso paste
2 yellow onions, roughly chopped
2 carrots, peeled and roughly chopped
1 garlic head, cloves separated (unpeeled) and smashed
1 ounce dried porcini mushrooms
8-10 sprigs fresh parsley
4-6 sprigs fresh thyme
2 bay leaves
1 teaspoon black peppercorns
Mashed potatoes
To garnish: chopped parsley

Mushrooms Bourguignon Method:
1. Add 3 tablespoons of the oil to a medium pot or dutch oven. Heat the oil over medium heat until shimmering, then add half of the mushrooms, half of the pearl onions, ½ teaspoon salt, ¼ teaspoon pepper. Stir to combine the ingredients, then cover the pot and cook until the mushrooms have released all of their liquid, 6-8 minutes. Uncover the skillet or pot and increase the temperature to medium-high. Continue cooking the vegetables until all of the moisture has evaporated, 8-10 minutes. Transfer the cooked vegetables to large bowl and reserve.
2. Repeat step 1 with another 3 tablespoons of oil and the remaining mushrooms, pearl onions, salt, and pepper. Reserve the second batch of vegetables in the same bowl as the first.
3. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the pot and heat for over medium-high heat. Whisk the flour into the oil until a dry paste forms. Cook the roux for 1-2 minutes or until it turns golden brown.
4. Very slowly pour the broth into the roux, while whisking constantly. The mixture should thicken as the roux is incorporated into the liquid.
5. Once all of the broth is incorporated, stir in the agar-agar, tomato paste, miso paste, yellow onions, carrots, garlic, porcini mushrooms, parsley sprigs, thyme sprigs, bay leaves, peppercorns, and 2 cups of wine.
6. Bring the mixture to boil and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 12 - 15 minutes.
7. Strain the mixture and reserve the cooking liquid. Then, return the liquid back to the pot and stir in the remaining wine.
8. Bring the stew to boil over medium heat. Cook, while stirring periodically, until it is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, 6-8 minutes.
9. Reduce the heat to a simmer, then add the reserved mushroom/onion mixture, and cook until just heated through, 2 to 4 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
10. Serve the stew over mashed potatoes and garnish with chopped parsley.

_o6I4uTC_js,Philly Soft Pretzels & Kansas City Cheesy Corn | Football Fusion,"To celebrate the upcoming Big Game, Sawyer is taking soft pretzels from the Philadelphia Eagles and Cheesy Corn from the Kansas City Chiefs to make this game day dish.

Recipes:
*Soft Pretzel Bites*
200 g all purpose flour
150 g bread flour
7 g instant dry yeast
20 g light brown sugar
1 ½ tsp kosher salt
2 Tbsp unsalted butter, melted + cooled to ~90 °F
240 g whole milk, ~80 °F
2 Cups water
¼ Cup baking soda
Rock/pretzel salt

1. Combine the flours, yeast, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer. Whisk to combine.
2. Add the melted butter and whole milk to the bowl and begin mixing the dough using the dough hook attachment.
3. Once the dough has come together into a shaggy mass, continue mixing on medium speed for 6-8 minutes or until a smooth and homogeneous dough ball forms. *If the dough is too sticky, add more flour as necessary during the kneading process.
4. Transfer the dough to a greased bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature for 45 minutes - 1 hour.
5. Meanwhile, heat the water and baking soda until the baking soda completely dissolves in the water. Let the mixture cool to about 75 °F (or room temperature).
6. Towards the end of proofing, preheat the oven to 400 °F with convection fan on. Line two half sheet trays with parchment paper. Transfer the cooled baking soda/water mixture into a large ramekin or small baking dish.
7. Divide the dough into 8 equal portions. Roll each portion into and log about 1 inch wide. Cut the log into 1-inch pieces.
8. Working in batches, add the dough bites to the baking soda/water solution and let them sit for 30 seconds to 1 minute, then remove them using a slotted spoon or metal spider. Transfer the dough bites to the prepared sheet trays.
9. Sprinkle the pretzel bites with rock salt.
10. Bake the pretzel bite for 12-15 minutes or until golden brown and the internal temperature of the bites reaches 195 °F.

*Cheesy Corn*
8 oz thick cut bacon, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
8 oz whole milk
8 oz cream cheese
1 lb frozen corn – or 1 (14 oz) bag
1 ½ tsp kosher salt
¾ tsp freshly ground black pepper
8 oz american cheese, shredded
6 oz mild cheddar cheese, shredded

1. Preheat the oven to medium broil.
2. Cook the bacon in a large high-walled skillet. Remove the cooked bacon and reserve. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon of the bacon fat.
3. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds to 1 minute.
4. Add the milk and bring the mixture to a simmer. Add the cream cheese, corn, and spices, then cook until the cream cheese has melted.
5. Turn off the heat, add back the chopped bacon, and stir in the the american cheese and half of the cheddar cheese. Stir to combine, then transfer the mixture to an oven safe dish.
6. Sprinkle the remaining cheese over top and then place the baking dish in the oven. Broil for 4-6 minutes or until the cheese is melted and lightly browned.
