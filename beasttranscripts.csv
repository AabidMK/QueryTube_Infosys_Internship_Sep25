YLt73w6criQ,"- Behind me is an assassin.
And if he stabs me with this rubber knife
by the end of the day,
he wins a hundred grand.
Here's your rubber knife.
Good luck.
- Get me outta this rope.
(siren wailing)
(person grunts)
(lever clicks)
- What you do?
(person grunts)
- [Chandler] I can't get out.
- [Mr. Beast] Later boys.
I left you a car in the woods.
(suspenseful music)
- What? Are you out?
- This video is gonna be
the craziest video you've ever seen.
We have a real tank, an entire carnival,
I'm blowing up a bank,
and so much more all to
escape this real assassin.
You wanna watch this video.
- Oh my God, he's just driving away.
- [Assassin] We gotta hurry guys.
- I'm gonna stab that guy.
- There's a car somewhere in the woods
we have to find.
- [Assassin] Guys, there's the car.
- [Karl] Are you sure this one's for you?
- Pretty sure.
(people laughs)
- [Chandler] Go, go, go.
- And now we're arriving
at the train station.
There are dozens of train cars
in this massive warehouse.
It's going to take him forever to find me.
Inside this Cars backpack
is not only a hundred grand
but also a tracker giving
him my real time location.
- Okay, I found Jimmy.
He seems to be stopped at like
a warehouse just up ahead.
- What's it look like
around the warehouse?
- It seems like where all the trains go.
- Yeah.
(Karl chuckles)
- How did Jimmy find an
assassin for this anyway?
- I found Jimmy, he didn't find me.
(suspenseful music)
- Giving the assassin a car
made him think this would be easy,
but it's time for a reality check.
(screen whooshes)
Chris, are you in the tank?
- Yeah, where did we get a tank from?
- Don't worry about that.
When the assassin and the
boys are in the warehouse
destroy their car.
- Roger that. Over and out.
- So, I've seen the other
guys that chased Jimmy.
He's gonna be ready there for us.
So, you can point and
laugh and call us nerds.
Well, that ain't gonna happen this time.
All right guys, we're pulling in.
And we're gonna get right
up next to the building.
And then we're gonna slip in
that open door over there.
- He's so intent.
There's a camera. There's
a camera right there.
Right there.
(intense music)
(suspenseful music)
- Let's see if he's back that way.
- [Chandler] Let's go.
- Chris, they're inside the
warehouse, you know what to do.
- Roger that. Bravo six going dark..
Destroy the car.
(Chris screaming)
(tank whirring)
(graphics thump)
(laughs) Oh, my God.
- Chris, how's the flattening going?
(Chris screaming)
- [Assassin] What is going on?
- [Chandler] How did I not see this?
- [Assassin] Is this a door?
- [Jimmy] We gotta go, we gotta go.
Come on.
- Hey, something's
definitely in there.
(suspenseful music)
(glass shattering)
- Right here is our getaway car.
(glass shattering)
Go, go, go.
- [Assassin] Go, go, go, go.
(object clattering)
(van crashing)
- [Jimmy] Holy crap.
Get us outta here.
- [Assassin] Go, go, go.
- Whoo! Was that epic?
That was insane.
It's gone.
We gotta get to the car.
Let's go. All right.
Oh, no. Are you kidding me?
- What?
- They ran over our car
with a tank.
- I ran over your car with a tank.
- Jimmy.
- What up?
- Our car is literally
a pancake right now.
- Yeah, you can Uber to the next location
or you can buy a new car.
Up to you.
(screen whooshes)
- [Assassin] Is that our Uber?
Hello.
We're right behind him, step on it.
All right guys, he's on
the highway traveling east.
- Oh, he's just running down that highway.
He's going. Where are we?
- We are far.
- Oh.
- Now we're at the hotel
where we rented every room.
So, these are our room keys. (laughs)
I'll even there for the
assassin, I don't need 'em.
And while we're waiting for
the assassin on the 20th floor,
we have over a hundred cameras
monitoring every inch of the hotel.
- I've seen his tracker stop here.
This place is huge.
Probably a million rooms in it.
He's not gonna get away from us again.
Alright, fellas.
Tracker's telling me he's inside.
- Oh, what is this?
- This doesn't look right.
- We got room keys.
(audio thudding)
10th floor.
- Is there a doofus on the line?
- You're not very stealthy.
Since you just walkied? me,
that means you're within
walkie-talkie range.
Which means you're now in the hotel
which I didn't know you were in.
- That's my bad.
- Oh.
- [Jimmy] I'm hiding in one of
over 200 rooms in this hotel.
I also put a little
something in every room.
Good luck.
(assassin gulps)
- I knew it.
(cap thuds)
- I just want to get up there quick
and just get on him as fast as possible.
- [Karl] Let's do this.
Here we go.
Do you hear this?
(person screaming)
(lock clicking)
What is not in here?
- [Assassin] Nope, this it ain't guys.
(relaxing music)
(door clicks)
(elegant trumpet music)
He's not in here, let's go.
- [Jimmy] Oh, they are on
the 10th floor, oh my gosh.
Mr. Assassin, look up at that camera.
- How about this one, Jimmy?
(shoe smacks)
- We still have a hundred other cameras.
(footsteps thumping)
- Jimmy.
(footsteps thumping)
Coming in, Jimmy.
- [Karl] What's up guys?
(footsteps thumping)
No way.
(footsteps thumping)
(object thudding)
- [Assassin] Jimmy.
- [Karl] 18.
- What floor are they on?
- 18.
- 18.
- 18? Oh, wait a minute.
I might need to
(hands rustling)
get ready.
Mr. Assassin, here's the deal.
You're running out of time
and we both know you're never
gonna find me without a hint.
I'll give you the exact
location to me in this hotel,
if you tie up Chandler
and Karl in room 1802.
- [Assassin] Yeah, I'll tie these guys up.
- Don't talk to me until you do that.
(walkie-talkie explodes)
I hope that didn't break,
'cause I need to talk to him.
- [Assassin] Oh, my legs.
- [Karl] Oh, man.
- [Jimmy] Hey, Karl.
- Yes, Jimmy.
- I want you to know it's not personal.
- It feels pretty personal.
- Alright, let's go.
- I'm so tired, I'm not gonna fight it.
- I know we didn't help you much.
(Chandler coughs)
And we let Jimmy get away.
- I hope you get him.
Stab him good.
- Little do they know
I'm literally two floors
above them right now.
- Yeah, it's nothing personal guys.
All right, Jimmy.
These guys ain't going nowhere.
- Mr. Assassin, here's your hint.
I'm on the 20th floor.
- Go.
- Do it for your daughter.
- And now that he knows where I'm at
I'm gonna try to do an ad
read without getting stabbed.
TurboTax is the number one way
to get the biggest tax refund possible.
On average last year,
people get over $3,000
on their tax refunds.
That's a lot of money.
Can you gimme like one minute
to finish this ad read?
(footsteps thumping)
(crickets chirping)
He didn't respond.
I should probably start moving.
TurboTax will do your
taxes, wherever you are.
Even if you're running from an assassin.
(door thuds)
Last year, TurboTax helped
people get over $113 billion
in tax refund.
(alarm blaring)
Oh, God, that means he's up here.
All right.
(footsteps thumping)
Come on.
(button clicking)
(elevator chimes)
Here with TurboTax you can
be confident your taxes are done right.
(alarm blaring)
And you're probably wondering
if there was an elevator,
why didn't he take it
all the way to the top?
(elevator chimes)
Well,
'cause I hid it with a secret wall.
(wall thuds)
(grunts) That hurts.
A little too good of a secret wall.
(bag thudding)
(alarm blaring)
(suspenseful music)
Whoo! Don't wait until
April 18th to do your taxes.
Click the link description
and get your tax refund
right now with TurboTax.
Doing ad read while
running from an assassin
is very stressful.
Mr. Assassin.
- Jimmy.
- Listen to this real quick.
(door clanks)
That's my door to my
getaway vehicle later, nerd.
(walkie-talkie thuds)
- He just ninja flipped outta here again.
(screen whooshes)
- This time we're making
our exit in a Lamborghini.
Tareq, what up.
- Wait, what are you doing?
- An assassin's currently
running down 20 flights
of stairs to stab me.
- Oh, well we gotta go.
- You're the driver.
- All right, hold on, I need to learn
how to drive this thing.
- I don't even know how we
got down there so quick.
Part of me wishes I still
have the boys right now.
- Is this your first time
driving a Lamborghini?
- Yes.
- Oh, my God, whoa.
- We gotta get back on our ride.
- We're going to the helicopter.
It's gonna fly us to a bank
and then we're gonna blow up the bank.
(graphic thumps)
(bag thuds)
- Whoo.
(helicopter whirring)
(person speaking indistinctly)
See you at the next location
- Hey, stop, stop, stop.
(helicopter whirring)
Just missed him. Let's go.
Let's go. Hundred grand.
His tracker's moving so fast.
Can't believe he's in
a helicopter right now.
- The helicopter put me way ahead
and now the assassin has
less than three hours
to win a hundred grand.
- That's the bank?
- For now it is.
Oh, God.
Let's see if he can stab me
while I'm hiding in this double
reinforced steel bank vault.
(walkie-talkie thuds)
- Tracker stopped, luckily
he didn't get too far.
Now I have an opportunity
to stab him before midnight
and get my money.
- How's it going?
- Well, we're here.
- I'm in the bank vault
but I don't think you have
enough time to break in.
Good luck
- Bank vault. Let's do it.
Bank's open late.
(suspenseful music)
(door slams)
- He just kicked out a door.
(doors slamming)
I think he's literally lost his mind.
(doors slamming)
(suspenseful music)
(timer beeping)
Oh, my God.
(hands thudding)
- You in there, Jimmy?
(vault lock clanking)
(door thuds)
(Nolan laughs)
- (laughs) He fell for it.
He fell for it.
- It worked.
- It worked.
Mr. Assassin, there's two bank vaults
and you picked the wrong one.
- Yeah, I saw one vault.
Figured that'd be the one.
- [Jimmy] Above the bank vault you're in
is another bank vault.
But you didn't pick that one.
You picked the easy one and
now you're trapped with Nolan.
Is that a sledgehammer?
(sledgehammer thudding)
(audio whistling)
This thing's double steel reinforced,
it doesn't matter.
(sledgehammer thudding)
- I really did fall for it,
pretty bad at this one, didn't I?
- [Nolan] Yeah.
- Chris, see that hook right there?
I need to attach it there.
I'm gonna attach this one here.
And we'll get you outta
here in just a second.
Get comfortable, we might
move a little bit, okay?
- You say get comfortable.
- Hold on to something.
(wall cracking)
(Chris grunts)
- There's some activity going on
right outside of the door here.
- Well, one, I might
actually win the challenge.
The only thing standing between that safe
and the road is this brick wall.
- Are you telling me to rob a bank?
- Yeah, actually I am.
- [Chris] And (indistinct).
- Why is this thing moving.
- [Jimmy] Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.
(upbeat rock music)
(Nolan grunting)
- What is happening?
- You didn't tell me about this part.
- I can't believe that worked.
If you're gonna rob a bank,
why don't you just do it like this?
Nolan, has the assassin
attacked at you yet?
- Well, I'm talking to you, Jimmy, so no.
- Darn.
Now we're gonna drive you
10 miles down the road.
- I can't take this.
- Yeah, we're not going
on the highway, are we?
- You have one hour left to win this
hundred thousand dollars.
I'll make your transportation quick.
All right, get 'em outta here.
(vault crashing)
- Did we get lifted up
into the air at some point?
(triumphant music)
- [Jimmy] Oh, and as promised.
(bank explodes)
(upbeat music)
Literally, everything has
gone according to my plan.
I crushed his car,
bamboozled him at the hotel,
escaped in a Lamborghini and a helicopter,
and now he's trapped in a safe with Nolan.
There is less than 40 minutes
left in the challenge.
So we're heading to one last location,
because keeping him in a bank vault
kind of feels like we're cheating.
For our last location,
we built a carnival, but all
of this is a very expensive
and elaborate distraction
while I'm gonna try to
fake a serious injury
and see if he still stabs me.
I'm gonna give him one last chance.
This time, face to face.
The truck is now here with the safe.
I'm gonna go over there
and break my ankle.
All right.
(ladder thuds)
(siren blaring)
I've never broken a film before.
We ended the production and
had the camera crew leave.
The only cameras that kept rolling
were hidden spy cameras from far away.
There's 20 minutes left in the challenge.
Let's see if he still stabs
me even though I'm hurt.
I think you should let him out, Tareq.
Guy, get ready.
Get ready.
(door creaking)
- Guys, Jimmy got hurt.
- [Assassin] Really?
- [Tareq] Literally, get out.
Jimmy got hurt.
- [Jimmy] No, it just hurts.
(person speaking indistinctly)
- [Assassin] What happened?
- My foot.
- He fell off the ladder.
- Right, so where (indistinct)
- Finished wrapping up-
- Got all this for
a broken ankle, huh?
- Yeah.
(suspenseful music)
(knife clinks)
- Yeah, I don't know about that.
(suspenseful music)
(heart beating)
- So, was it that obvious?
- Whoo! Let's go!
(triumphant music)
You don't splint a broken ankle.
- That is true.
I should have broke my leg.
I was hoping I'd get away with
it for at least a little bit.
Here's your a hundred thousand dollars.
- This means a lot to me and my family.
Thank you.
- Well, now I'm glad
you stabbed me.
That was a weird sentence.
Thank you guys for watching.
- Subscribe or I'm gonna hunt you down.

TJ2ifmkGGus,"- In this video,
we're curing 1,000 people's blindness.
(crowd cheering)
It's gonna be crazy.
- [Narrator 1] Most of us
see the world like this.
But here's the thing,
200 million people see
the world like this.
- [Mr. Beast] But I just made it one less.
- Oh.
Wow.
- [Narrator 1] She is just one
of 1000 blind people we helped
from around the world.
- They can't see.
But we have all the technology to fix it.
- Yep, half of all the
blindness in the world
is people who need a 10-minute surgery.
- Crazy.
- Yeah.
- Oh my God.
I see everybody.
- Oh, I can see clearer. (laughs)
I can jump for joy! (laughs)
- Yeah, I can see your face,
I can see your face,
I can see your face.
- [Mr. Beast] If you're wondering
how the surgery allows
people to see again,
it's because the lens in
their eyes is so cloudy
that they can't see through it.
So the surgeon uses a tiny vacuum
to suck up the clouded lens.
- Whoa, it's sucking.
- [Mr. Beast] And replace
it with an artificial one.
- [Narrator 2] The surgery is that simple.
They can see again.
- Woo...
Oh my...
- You pay for my surgery?
- Yes.
- Seriously?
- You know what?
Here's $10,000.
To make your day even better.
(person in mask screaming)
Is she okay?
We're gonna go fix more people's eyesight.
She's squeezing hard.
- [Narrator 1] And we're
just getting started.
We still have 980 lives left to change.
- Sheesh! There's my watch.
I've never seen it before.
- Oh my God.
- I have night blindness,
I couldn't see.
And you just deal with it for life.
- I'm Nolan, by the way.
- I'm Karl.
- You're Karl?
I know a guy named Karl.
Not a good guy.
- [Mr. Beast] Moment of truth.
- Wow, you are pretty ain't you?
(Mr. Beast chuckling)
- What's it like?
What do you see?
- Blur.
- How long have you not
been able to work for?
- Four months?
- Did you hear about
the cross eyed teacher?
She couldn't control her pupils.
- Ugh...
- I'm gonna need an anesthetic soon.
(dramatic upbeat music)
- Oh man.
No cloudiness, no blurriness.
- Oh, it's perfect.
- [Mr. Beast] Now what's it like?
- I can see everything.
- I don't need these. (laughs)
- Our next patient is Charlie.
You're not able to read
any of this text on the TV?
- Nope, it's an E or something I think.
- He won't know he won 10 grand
until after his surgery.
I can't wait to see his reaction.
Charlie sees everything like this,
and it's made him and his
family's life extremely difficult.
- I was a cashier
and my eyes was getting so bad,
I couldn't see how much
money to give back.
I just wanna get my vision back
so I can go back to work.
- Man, you're gonna be really
happy after this surgery.
- We'll see after it.
- Trust me, you will see.
- [Mr. Beast] When
patients go into surgery,
there's a chance that they
can get their life back.
And for Charlie,
if the surgery goes well,
he can go back to work.
What's it like?
- Oh, wow.
- All right, let's see
if he can read it now.
What does this say?
- You just won $10,000.
- Here you go.
- Oh my gosh.
- Oh my gosh.
- Oh.
- [Charlie] It feels good.
I didn't think I was ever
gonna be able to see again.
- Thank you all so much.
- I don't wanna lose none of it.
- I'll hold on to it.
- Oh no, I'll hold on to it.
(everyone laughing)
- Dr. Nolan.
- He's not really a doctor.
He's a fool.
- Do you need any help?
(medical staff laughing)
(upbeat music continues)
- Wow.
- And I just haven't been
me for the last 62 years.
I can actually see your face.
- That's crazy.
- I can read this.
(Mr. Beast laughing)
- When you come out of the surgery,
what's the first thing that
you are excited to see?
- My son.
He's been my rock through all of this.
- Before the operation,
you mentioned the first
thing you wanted to see
was your son.
- Seeing him,
seeing his face.
That's what I miss you know.
- You're gonna make me cry.
- No, no.
You're good, man.
You're good.
You're really good, man.
- [Mr. Beast] All right.
- Oh my God, man.
- There you go.
- Hey, Dad.
Don't cry.
- I can see everybody's
facial features now.
Just a little blurry
with my tears coming out.
(everyone chuckling)
- How's it going?
- Okay. (chuckles)
Yeah, I've been subscribed
to you for like 11 years.
- Really? Oh my gosh.
- Jeremiah has been blind in his right eye
since he was born.
And it's affected his
vision his entire life.
Are you excited to be
able to see out of both?
- Hopefully, if the surgery goes that way.
- [Narrator 1] Because Jeremiah
was born with cataracts,
his right eye has never received light.
Which means this surgery only
has a 50% chance of working.
- I think we go ahead
and get it underway,
and then we'll just talk post-op.
- [Narrator 1] And while
Jeremiah's surgery was underway,
I met another young man named, Satchel.
- Did they tell you I was gonna be here?
- No.
- Good.
He had poor vision from birth,
and almost lost his entire vision
after a go-karting accident.
- All I see is like blur and color.
I can barely see the shapes.
- Obviously, you can't drive, right?
- No, I cannot.
- And this is the real
reason why we're doing this.
Blindness can take away
parts of your life.
- And you know, I wanna drive.
Since I can't drive,
I'm just at home.
- Good luck.
We'll see you after the procedure.
He mentioned multiple times,
he really wants to drive
after this procedure fixes his eyesight.
So I'll see you at the end of the video
when we surprise him
with a brand new Tesla.
- [Narrator 1] But first,
let's see if Jeremiah's
surgery was successful.
- Let's do this.
How'd it go?
- Good.
- Yeah?
Are you excited?
- (laughs) Yeah.
(gentle uplifting music)
- Take your time.
No pressure.
- Everything looks so more clear.
- Yeah?
To make this day even more special,
since you're about to graduate high school
and go to college,
we wanted to give you $50,000
to put towards college.
(gentle uplifting music continues)
- I didn't even think this was real.
Like I'm waiting to wake up.
Oh my god.
- [Narrator 2] And now,
let's check in to see how
Satchel's surgery went.
- Now I don't even see any blur.
It's kind of great.
- How are you feeling?
How's life been now?
- It's been good, you know.
I'll be like looking at the cars
and I'm like, ""Wow, I can see that car
""all the way over there.""
- That's good.
If you're gonna drive.
- Yeah.
(everyone laughing)
- I have a surprise for you.
Do you mind putting on this blindfold?
- Hold on, hold on.
- I know it's a little ironic
that we just did the surgery.
Satchel, take off your blindfold.
(car horn beeping)
- What?
(upbeat music)
- This is your brand new Tesla.
- Woo!
- And if Chris wrecks it,
I'll buy another one.
- Oh! (chuckles)
Literally, I cannot put into words
how I feel right now.
- Have you ever driven a car before?
- No.
(upbeat music continues)
- I love how we're letting a guy
who couldn't see a couple
weeks ago drive us.
- Yeah.
- Wait.
There's one cone you should hit.
- Don't hit the cone.
(upbeat music continues)
- Yeah!
(everyone applauding)
(car horn beeping)
- So not only are we helping
people here in America
but we're also going to other
places around the world.
- [Narrator 1] Because unfortunately,
nearly half the population
with curable blindness
doesn't have access to this surgery.
- [Narrator 2] So I wanted to provide this
for as many people as possible.
(uplifting orchestral music)
- You see how many?
- Two.
- I can see!
- As a thank you
because you were just so
gracious in this video,
we wanna make a $100,000 donation.
- It'll bring sight to
thousands of people.
(speaking in foreign language)
- I see everything.
- Oh my god, you are so beautiful.
(Nolan laughing)
Wow!
- Thank you, Mr. Beast.
- Thank you.
- [Everyone] Thank you!
(uplifting orchestral music fades)"
7IKab3HcfFk,"- We just landed in Antarctica,
and we're gonna survive
the next 50 hours here.
We're literally at the
bottom of the globe,
at the coldest place on Earth.
(bell dings)
- Can't wait to freeze to death.
(plane engine hums)
- And there goes the plane.
Right, all right, see you later.
And now that that plane has left, boys,
there's no way out for the next 50 hours.
- We're stuck.
- [Jimmy] First, we need to
trek towards the mountains,
to get some protection from the wind.
- This is the most beautiful
place I've ever seen.
- Shut up, Nolan.
(laughter)
- There's already a blizzard incoming.
Just our luck.
- The weather is so bad already.
- This is so bad!
- Holy crap.
- What are the odds that
a blizzard would happen
right when we get here?
- It's cold!
- Jimmy, bro, this is insane.
- Let's go!
- We'll set up shelter at
the bottom of that mountain.
Woo, I almost died.
- [All] Antarctica! Antarctica!
Antarctica!
- I declare this Camp Beast.
(all cheering)
- [Jimmy] It's negative 30 degrees,
and if we're gonna survive 49 more hours-
- Grab it! Grab it!
- My tent about flew away.
- [Jimmy] We need a shelter ASAP.
The tutorial said to go at an angle.
Oh!
- I don't know, like,
we've got it all wrong.
How's it so low to the ground?
It's in my sleeve! (screams)
- They're like little children.
- We're screwed.
- Whoa, they're actually making progress.
- Look at us, we're the best!
- Beast Camp is thriving!
(stakes pounding)
(drums pounding)
A common problem in Antarctica
is extreme weather blowing away your tent.
We gotta cut snow blocks to
secure the tents from wind.
So we're gonna use these ice blocks
to build a wall and keep our camp safe.
It's literally dropped 20
degrees since we got here.
We need to build the wall faster.
(dramatic music)
- (grunts) Holy cow.
Dude, this is by far the
hardest thing we've ever done.
- Beast Camp is now finished!
(cheering)
Now that the ice wall is finished,
hopefully, the wind won't
blow away our tents.
The hard part about Antarctica
is the sun never goes down.
So you don't know when it's night or not.
- My tummy tells me when it is.
- What time does your tummy say it is?
- Dinner time.
- Welcome home, honey.
- Whoa, it's red in here.
- And for dinner, we have MREs.
- Woo!
- Jimmy, this is awful.
Welcome to Antarctica.
- [Jimmy] And in case you're wondering
how you eat in the most
remote place on the planet.
First, you boil water, then
you pour the boiling hot water,
you gotta be careful, in here.
And then in 10 minutes, you have food.
And that's how you eat in Antarctica.
- Oh, you don't know how good that tastes.
(wind howls)
- [Dream] I am so ready to sleep.
- In my tent is Nolan and Dream.
And Karl, who's in yours?
- [Karl] It's me, Chandler,
Sapnap, and George.
- You're going to bed, right?
- [Karl] Yeah.
- I am so tired, I'm sick.
Antarctica, not a good
place to get sick in.
- Jimmy has no idea
We're digging a tunnel.
- Oh my God.
- Let's go.
- It's just so crazy how he's so far down.
- [Dream] Jimmy, I don't think
I'm gonna make it 50 hours.
- The wind is picking up,
so we're gonna have a hard time sleeping.
All right, guys, well, bro fist out.
- [Jimmy] The sun
literally never goes down
in Antarctica, so night one was rough.
- It's the next morning,
and I don't know if I'm supposed
to get outta bed or not.
'Cause the sun's just always up.
- Morning one, this is miserable.
- Bro, Antarctica is not a funin' place.
(George laughs)
I'm sick, man.
I woke up coughing up blood.
- Before you can leave
your tent in Antarctica,
you need long pants, a long-sleeved shirt,
a second pair of pants (grunts),
a third pair of pants, a jacket,
a jacket for your jacket, a ski mask,
whatever this is, gloves,
gloves for your gloves,
gloves and goggles so your
eyeballs don't freeze.
And despite having all this
on, I can still get frostbite.
Going into day two,
there's two very important
things we need to take care of.
Number one:
In Antarctica, you would
think you could just pee
in the snow, but you can't.
So we have to pee in these bottles
and hold onto it until
the end of the video.
It's negative 20 degrees.
Let's see if I can pee.
Hey, I got it!
- He did it!
- I got it.
(party fanfare)
- Nice.
- Woo, that took like five minutes.
And number two:
A lot of the boys have to poop,
so we're going away from
camp to set up a poop tent.
- I gotta poop.
- The worst part of Antarctica is
that giant blizzards would
randomly sweep through,
and your skin would
literally start freezing.
- Oh no, the tent!
(all yell)
(dramatic choral music)
- Oh, ow, it hurts!
- (slapping) Bad tent, bad.
- Hold it down!
- Stay down, tent.
- Oh, it worked.
This bucket is my toilet,
and that's the bathroom.
I'm gonna come out a better man.
- Nolan, how is it?
- That was the worst
experience in my life.
- See that mountain right there?
- [All] Yes!
- It currently does not have a name.
And everyone knows that
if you climb a mountain,
you gidda name it.
Who wants to join me?
- Not me.
- I'll just grab my stuff
out of the tent really quick.
- Okay.
- I left something in my tent.
- The weather's kind of bad.
- Come on.
- I might just have to...
- Hey, you're climbing
the mountain with me.
- Just cause I'm the last one here?
- I need someone to be
hooked up to in case I fall.
- Well, I'm glad it's not windy.
- Seriously, since that
mountain isn't named,
if we climb it, we
literally get to name it
whatever we want.
- Bye, guys!
- Bye.
- Bye, bye.
- Now, Operation Hole.
Come on.
(George laughs)
(Karl sighs)
- For the past 20-something hours,
we've been digging this hole.
By the time Jimmy's back,
this is gonna be massive!
(""massive"" echoes through mountains)
- We're not even at the mountain,
and we faced our first obstacle.
It's a sea of ice.
Look at this view.
Antarctica's crazy.
Dude, beautiful.
- Just be very careful, Jimmy.
- Woo, this is very slippery.
- Very careful.
Less than 10 people on earth
have ever stepped here.
- That's the mountain
we're gonna be climbing.
Anyways, let's climb before we die.
- Onward!
- Oh, my gosh.
- Whoa, oh, don't slip.
- Oh, this is wild.
I'm so terrified.
There's a drop to my right.
If I fall backwards, I roll for 2000 feet.
(Jimmy grunts)
- Jimmy.
- What?
- We're 30 hours in!
- Oh, yes!
- This is a huge cliff.
No joke, no joking.
- [Jimmy] If we fall down there, we die.
- [Nolan] Yeah, hundred percent.
- Karl's still digging
though it's so deep.
- Bro, how am I gonna get out?
(intense music)
- Jimmy!
- I'm right here.
Just keep stepping.
- Woo, yes, I'm alive.
- I'm gonna take a pee break.
- Spell ""I cup.""
- I C-U-P.
(Nolan giggles)
- I hate you.
- Hey, Jimmy?
(Jimmy exhales)
- Hey, just don't mix up
the water bottles.
- Oh yeah.
See those tiny little specks over there?
That's our base camp.
I wonder what the boys are up to.
- Here comes the airplane, mmm.
- Ah-um.
- Yummy.
- Yum!
- The hole provides, and now
he must provide for the hole.
- While Jimmy's climbing the mountain,
we could have built up more
walls to fortify our camp.
We could have cleaned up their tents.
We coulda cooked them meals
for them to get home to.
But instead, we dug this hole.
This is the best use of our time possible.
- [Jimmy] Stop filming me and
film that view over there.
It feels like we're on a different planet.
You can't convince me this is Earth.
And while we climb this mountain,
I wanna tell you guys about Shopify.
A platform that makes starting
a business incredibly easy.
Shopify helped me provide
YouTube channel into a business.
And they can do it for whatever
you're passionate about.
Like climbing mountains.
Woo.
If you've ever bought
my merch or feastables,
you've used it.
Oh, let's see, how do I do this?
I'm forever grateful for them
because I've been using 'em
since we had 3 million subscribers.
Shopify literally powers businesses.
Oh, God, um.
All right, gimme a second Shopify.
Woo, we're climbing!
Shopify powers businesses
in 175 countries.
Starting a business can be scary.
Kinda like climbing this mountain.
- Yeah.
- But entrepreneurship
allows you to wake up
every single day and do what you love.
So the risk is worth it.
We're almost to the top.
I can see it!
- This is the most terrifying
experience of my life.
- This is actually terrifying,
we're so high right now.
- Can you build an
elevator next time, Jimmy?
(music swells)
Right here, you got it?
I made it.
(triumphant music)
I made it!
It only took four and a half hours.
We did it!
We did it.
Nolan.
Yeah, woo!
We made it, and we didn't die.
We've claimed the mountain.
(music crescendos)
We did it!
And now that we climbed the
mountain, we gidda name it.
I think we should name it ""Shopify.""
Because, to be honest,
I couldn't have done it without Shopify.
- We just conquered Shopify.
- Go to shopify.com/behindbeast
to watch my exclusive
interview with Shopify.
This is now Shopify Mountain.
Karl, can you hear me?
- Yes, I can hear you, over.
- We climbed the mountain.
- [Karl] Congratulations, dude!
- Could you see us on top of the mountain?
- One second, we have to
get outside of the hole.
- Wait, what hole?
- No, I said the whole tent.
The entire tent.
- [Jimmy] Uh, okay.
- They literally look like
three little ants up there.
- Our base camp is over 10 miles away.
If that lens could see us, that's crazy.
You know the best part
about climbing a mountain?
- What?
- You have to climb down.
- No, no.
- Also, you can't leave things behind,
so I gotta take this flag down.
- I carried it up all the way for that?
What do you think they're
doing at camp right now?
- Not something intelligent.
(George growls)
- Best snow day ever!
- These sleeping bags are complicated.
What is this?
(both laugh)
(Karl imitates a seal)
- Dude, I gotta go to whiz.
- Okay, guys, it's four in the morning,
and Jimmy's finally arriving back
after climbing the mountain.
- This might have been the
hardest thing I've ever done.
- The hardest, but most rewarding thing.
- He has no idea we dug this hole,
so we're gonna get in and surprise him.
- Home sweet home, ah!
- I need a massage.
Ow, Jimmy.
(buzzing sound)
I'm not a bed.
Where is everybody?
- Nolan.
- Dream.
- Dream!
- Oh, my god!
How long were you gone for?
- Something's not normal.
I don't hear Karl going
""bleh, bleh, bleh!""
Karl?
They're probably asleep
'cause it's 4:00 AM.
Karl?
Wait, what, is everyone up?
- Jimmy's out there, you can see him.
(George coughs)
- What is down here?
Oh, my god!
Whoa, wait, how deep is that hole?
- It's like eight feet deep.
- I'm confused.
- What's so confusing?
It's just a hole.
- Yeah, but why?
- We're just trying to, you
know, make use of our time.
- I'm too tired to understand this.
- Get in the hole!
- [All] Yeah!
Hole, hole, hole.
- How?
How did they do this?
- [All] Hole, hole, hole, hole!
- I wanna get in the hole.
- This is actually a convenient hole.
Can you grab my iPad?
- Yeah.
- Do you know what's on this iPad?
- Penguin videos.
(Nolan laughs)
- No.
Our next two Mr. Beast videos.
- [All] Oh.
- I'll let you guys choose.
Do you guys wanna watch ""Blind
Man Sees for the First Time?""
Or ""I Ate the World's Largest Burger?""
- Blind Man Sees for the First Time.
- I wanna see the blind man, actually.
- Okay.
- There you go.
There's a little iPad.
(iPad beeping)
- Tell me what you think.
Is that crazy?
- Yeah, what?
- That was awesome.
- That was so cool.
- Oh, my god, it is cold here.
It's so cold that the screen
on the camera just went black.
- This is actually freezing outside.
- I don't wanna be here anymore.
I'm gonna head to bed.
- This the camera tent.
We're saying good night.
Good night, everybody.
- Climbing a mountain
really took it out of me.
And we got back at four in the morning.
It was nearly impossible to
get out of bed on day three.
- It's the last day.
You guys ready?
Jim?
- What?
- We have to pack up
before the plane leaves.
Otherwise, we're stuck here.
Look, if we miss this flight, Jimmy,
we're here for like another day.
- [Jimmy] I'll put pants on in a minute.
- Jimmy, get up!
- Or is this your first survival video?
- Yes.
- They haven't got out
of the tent, Derrick.
We are going to miss the flight.
Actually, let me rephrase that.
They're gonna miss the flight.
I'm still making it.
- We're making the flight, baby.
- [Jimmy] It is extremely important
to preserve the untouched
beauty of Antarctica.
We can't leave a single
trace of our camp behind.
So I made the boys put
everything back how it was.
""Leave nothing behind"" on three.
Three.
- [All] Leave nothing behind.
- But they were as exhausted as I was,
so things didn't get done quickly.
- I've got absolutely zero energy left.
All right, now put that in it.
Put it on-
(slapping sound)
(small explosion)
- No!
- There she is, out in the open.
No, no, no, no, stop, no.
(rapid thumping)
Stop!
- Salute.
- A sad day for all Antarcticans.
- Hole.
- Fill it in now.
- All right, get to filling, boys.
Three, two, goodbye hole.
- Goodbye, hole.
(snow thumping)
- There's a hole in my heart, instead.
(rising music)
- And boom!
We can now head home!
- [All] Yes, home, home, home, home!
- Hey, if we maintain this pace,
we'll get to the ice strip
right before the plane lands.
- [All] Plane, plane, plane, plane.
- Hey, Antarctica trip.
- [All] Antarctica! Antarctica!
- Right over here is the runway.
- Yes.
- All right, I see the plane.
(all cheer)
(George laughs)
I'm proud of all of you for surviving
50 hours in Antarctica!
(all cheer)
We're going home, and we survived!
- We did it!
- Massive shout out to ALE and EYOS.
They made this trip possible.
I hope you guys enjoyed.
- We're going home!
(cheering)
- [All] Home, home, home!
(explosion)
(wind howls)"
h5NvTTOlOtI,"- We're about to test things
that nobody has ever done before,
like flattening a Lamborghini
with a hydraulic press,
climbing a building with
a real Spider-Man suit,
the world's largest elephant
toothpaste experiment,
filling a pool with 1
billion Orbeez and more.
And to kick things off, we're gonna see if
that brick wall can stop this train.
This wall is 20 feet tall
and three feet thick.
It's not going down easy.
Give the orders.
- Large cheese.
- I hate you.
Send the train.
- Train us!
The train's coming!
- Will the brick wall stop the train?
Oh my God!
My gosh!
So the brick wall might
not have stopped it,
but later in this video,
we're gonna see if five semi trucks can.
But for this next experiment,
I bought this car,
built a giant ramp,
and we're gonna see how
many buses it can jump over.
How many buses will it jump?
At least three.
- Four!
- I think it's gonna jump
all 12 and go into the woods.
It's coming, it's coming-
- Okay.
- It went through a bus, holy crap!
- This looks like some
Fast & Furious stuff.
- Now let's do it,
but with the jet engines.
I may have forgotten to mention that.
The first car was just for reference.
This is the real experiment.
Here it comes.
Here it comes, oh, it's going way faster.
It literally knocked a bus over.
It's in the side of the bus!
- How does it keep doing that?
- Hey Jimmy?
- Yeah.
- You can't park here.
- For our next experiment
we have 1 billion Orbeez!
- That's a lot.
- We're gonna drop Tareq's
car from this helicopter
to see if the Orbeez can cushion the fall.
The only problem is, we
haven't told him yet.
Can I borrow that camera
real quick, Tareq?
What do you think that is over there?
- Yo, that's my car!
Wait, that's my car!
- See this iPad?
This is your car in the parking lot .
- I literally just parked
my car, earlier today.
Minutes later, a helicopter
just picked it up.
- Your car, baby!
- Yeah, if I know Jimmy, he's
just gonna lower it nicely.
- Oh, really?
- It'd be fine.
- Move it higher, move it higher.
- This is crazy!
- Keep going, a little higher.
Right about there, that's good.
- Three, two, one!
- No, no, no, no, hold on!
- Drop the car!
- Now, that was sick!
- Bro, that was a perfect landing.
That was better than me,
parallel parking that car.
- Now let's see if Tareq's car survived.
Open the floodgates.
Chris, no, come back!
There's a car in there!
- There's my car, it's destroyed!
- Hey, tell your bumper to watch out!
It almost bumped into me.
- No, no, no, no, my baby.
- There you go, it should be fine.
You don't even really need this part.
- This is wild .
- The best part is,
that wasn't even Tareq's car.
We picked up his car from
the parking lot, dropped it
in the middle of a random field,
picked up a perfect replica of his car
and then, dropped that in the Orbeez.
- What is happening?
This is not my car, actually?
- No, it's a replica of your car.
Your car is in the field over there.
- I don't like you right now.
- And now, we're back at the train
and we're gonna see if these
semi trucks could stop it.
These semi trucks are massive.
They're so big that I echo
if I talk in that direction.
Raise your hand if you
think the train will win.
- Me.
- Me.
- I have faith in the truck.
We also made crash test dummies
with the boys to see what
would happen to them.
- All right, Chandler's is secure.
- Do you think you'll survive?
- Oh, I don't know, Jim.
- Send the train!
- Train, train, train, train, train.
- Jimmy, the train is coming!
It's coming!
- So Tareq, make sure you
get that angle for us.
There it is.
Oh my God!
Wait, all right, it might stop it.
It might stop it!
Oh my gosh, no, it snapped it in half!
All that remains is train.
The train tore through the semi trucks
and could drag these
for a couple more miles if
we wanted to, ripped 'em.
- Oh no, my boy, my boy.
What's happened to him?
- Gosh, the arm's gone.
- Well, at least you're still attached.
- Let me see if the head's over here.
He's right here, boys.
- Verdict?
- Train won.
- Train won.
- Everyone agrees, the train won.
Hello Neighbor 2 just came out
and to celebrate, I built a
scaled replica of their house
in real life.
And we're gonna see what
happens if it gets hit
by a meteor.
And I made realistic-looking mannequins
of each of the boys,
because I wanted to find
the best place to hide
to survive a meteor hitting your house.
You can put your mannequins
anywhere in the house you want.
Try to survive the
meteor crash, come on in.
- Hello, neighbor!
- That's not real.
- It's so hard to get
this body in my trunk.
I think he'll be safe now.
- Are you hiding him on the couch?
- The pillow's gonna cushion
the fall from the meteor.
It has to work.
- You're telling me if a meteor's hurling
at your house, you're gonna hide up there.
- It's gonna miss this section.
- I'll be driving.
- Let's see how many of the boys survive?
Drop the meteor!
- Oh, here it comes.
- Oh!
- That was only one of three meteors.
Somehow, Karl didn't fall.
This is what it looks like
if a meteor hits your house.
Let's drop the next one.
And while we're waiting for them
to raise the next meteor,
I wanna tell you guys
about Hello Neighbor 2.
It's an atmospheric stealth horror game
about digging up your
creepy neighbor's secrets.
- That sounds scary.
- In this video game,
you investigate a series
of missing person cases in the
open world of Raven Brooks.
But trust no one, boys, everyone
in the game is a suspect.
- Trust no one.
- Not even Nolan.
- Yeah, we have meteor number two,
but this time, the meteor's on fire.
Drop the meteor!
- My car!
Hello Neighbor 2 is available right now
on PC, Xbox, Switch and
PlayStation Consoles.
Oh my God!
- You're definitely deceased.
The meteor's still smoking.
- Wait a minute, I'm okay!
- Somehow, Chris survived.
- I am smart.
We survived, buddy.
- Chandler, on the other
hand, didn't make it.
- Raise the last meteor.
Chandler, you're now me.
- I'm rich.
- Drop the meteor when you want.
- Drop the meteor!
- Oh, okay.
- Oh my goodness!
- Goodbye, Karl.
- Let's see if I survived.
Yes!
Click the link in the description
to go to Hello Neighbor
2's official website
and buy the game right now.
- And now you know where to
hide if a meteor's coming
at our house, you're welcome.
For our next experiment,
if you take this chemical
and mix it with that chemical...
You get elephant foam toothpaste.
In these containers, is 100
times, what we just did.
Hey, don't touch that bucket!
Back up.
I need you all to find a safe spot
because this next explosion
is 100 times bigger.
- Standing right here.
- At least I'll be safe on the roof.
- Dibs on roof.
Wait, Jimmy, did we get all the elephants,
so we can clean their
teeth with this toothpaste?
- You're funny.
When you pull, Chandler, you need to run.
- I'm 100% in the danger zone.
- Pull!
Oh my God!
Keep pulling!
Pull harder!
Oh God.
- Look at it go!
It filled the entire pool!
It looks like the pool's on fire.
- And that, is the new world record
for elephant foam toothpaste.
- Oh, it's steamy.
I wanna jump in it so bad.
It's the forbidden swimming pool now.
- We're officially cooler than Mark Rober.
- Yeah, and so is the entire
population of the Earth.
- You know what's cooler than this?
- Nolan's mom.
- You know what's cooler than Nolan's mom?
- What?
- Next experiment.
- This is Dave, a professional
Spider-Man stunt double.
This is a working Spider-Man suit,
and he's gonna climb
this entire building, go!
- Congratulations, your one foot up.
Are your spidey-senses tingling yet?
- Tingling like crazy.
- This Spider-Man suit
was made by J. Laser
and the highest he's climbed
with it, was 200 feet.
Dave's gonna climb 200 feet
and then climb 200 feet again,
up this massive skyscraper.
- This is nuts.
- He's right there.
- Wait, he's actually right there.
- Are you taking a picture?
I want a picture.
- I don't know how far I am.
I'm not gonna stop til I'm finished.
- He's literally outside the
building window right now.
Hey!
Hey!
- You're halfway there.
- Sounded like they said halfway.
This is insane.
- Starting to rain a bit.
Rain's really coming down now.
Come on.
- Whoa, wait, does his suit stop working?
- Dave, do you want us to let you down?
- I'm good.
I've been the real Spider-Man many times
and I don't give up.
Spidey never gives up.
- It looks like he got it working again.
How's he doing this?
- I gonna keep climbing.
This thing ain't over til I'm at the top.
I'm high.
- Just looking over the ledge
to see him, terrifies me.
There's a reason this guy
stunt doubles for Spider-Man.
He's almost there!
Dave, you're a monster, 400 feet.
Dave, you are insane.
Oh, he did it!
Here's $10,000.
- Holy crap.
- You deserve this.
When's the next Spider-Man movie?
- I can't say.
- All right, he's better than Tom Holland.
And now the moment you've all been waiting
for, hydraulic press.
- Hurry up, Jimmy!
It's too heavy!
- Can you guys move out the way?
- Oh yeah, sorry.
- Yeah, sure.
- Versus the Lamborghini.
Let's see how flat it can get.
And just like
throughout this video,
the boys are gonna see if
their mannequins can survive.
- This is how you deal
with your school bullies.
- The hood is the safest spot in a car.
- I'll guard you, Karl.
- Get to crushing!
- Let's go, baby!
- All right, well, Chandler's gone.
- I'm still okay.
- Oh snap.
Oh my God.
Wow, all the windows!
- Yes!
- Oh my gosh.
- The tires are collapsing.
- Wow, this is crazy.
In case you were wondering,
that Lamborghini doesn't work anymore.
- Definitely doesn't work now.
- I thought it would
squish it into a pancake.
So to make it up to you,
let's blow up the Lamborghini.
- Explosion!

- We just hit an hour!
- So far I have been retaining my sanity.
- [Mr Beast] Attention, you're
an hour into the challenge
and I'll give you a thousand
dollars if you get out.
And this is the only time
anyone will be receiving money,
unless you win.
You have 60 seconds to
decide, starting now.
- A thousand dollars is not enough money.
- I'm going to leave
for a thousand dollars.
- People are leaving!
Hey, is that your son?
Wait it's like father, like son.
- This is not good.
- You are the last one out.
Let's see the damage.
[Mr Beast] In just one hour,
we've eliminated 12 adults and 10 kids.
- How y'all gonna leave, and
leave us with like 88 adults?
- A lot of people just left.
I don't how to feel about that.
- [Mr Beast] And now that
we know who wants to win,
there's something we need to take care of.
- They gotta sign this.
- We have to sign this paper that says,
our kids can spend the money responsibly
and we won't use it on ourselves.
- [Mr Beast] As long as the kids win.
- I can't believe they're
actually signing it.
- [Mr Beast] And Chris
brought the bathroom.
- I got a toilet!
- Alright, you're good.
How many YouTubers does it
take to move a porta-potty?
- [Chris] Poop time!
- Bathroom!
- They just drilled a hole,
'cause it smells really bad in here.
- It smells horrible.
- [Chris] Is there somebody in there?
- [All] Yeah!
Why didn't you tell me?
I'm sorry!
Enjoy your poop.
- I don't know how you do this,
but is this the fart pipe?
- That's the fart pipe.
- I hope that was sand that fell off.
- {Nolan] We're five
hours into the challenge.
So I left everyone alone until morning
to see what they do.
- So the boredom's kinda kicked in.
We've been looking at these tiles
and kinda realized that
we can take 'em off, so.
- So, now we're gonna do that.
All of them.
- Who's going to school tomorrow?
- Take this.
Stand right there.
- Hey Nolan!
- [Nolan] Yeah! -
- I need you!
- Stop!
Why do you guys always do this?
- These things are so much fun.
- I've got an idea.
- Yeah?
- [Mr Beast] And the next morning,
one of the kids tried to see
how many adults were left.
- [Tareq] Hey!
- [Nolan] He's trying to cheat!
Are you trying to tell them?
I'm gonna have to escort
you away from the 500 grand.
- What was the number?
- It was locked.
- No!
- [Nolan] And because of him,
both teams were tied at 78.
So let's see if we can
get some people out.
- We brought you all oatmeal!
- It's not good!
- Who made this?
- [Tareq] I don't know, it was not me.
- You did a terrible job
and I want your cooking license revoked.
- What just happened?
You just walk out?
- Wait, whoa!
[Mr Beast] The oatmeal always works.
- Now that any of you just left,
who do you think's winning?
- Them.
- Yeah.
- The oatmeal is deadly here, it's so bad.
- Oh no!
- [Mr Beast] Since
nobody liked the oatmeal,
- It didn't have no sugar.
- [ Mr Beast] I had an idea.
If two of you get out, I'll
give everyone Taco Bell.
- [All] No!
- [Mr Beast] Now I'm gonna make
the same offer to the adults
but I think they might
want something else.
- I want a cup of coffee so bad.
- Coffee.
- Caffeine!
- Here's the situation.
If you want coffee, two
of you have to get out
and I'll go get 75 cups of coffee.
You'll do it?
- When's this gonna air on the YouTube?
- The YouTube?
- [Mr Beast] Nolan promised 75 coffees.
Let's go see how Starbucks reacts.
Can I have 75 coffees?
- [Starbucks Employee] 75 what?
- [Mr Beast] Even though the
kids turned down my offer,
a few of them still decided to leave.
- What?
- Somebody's about to step
outta of the circle guys.
- [Kids] No!
- I'm gone.
- More money for us as soon as they leave.
- We brought the coffee!
- Thank you so much the coffee, man.
- Everybody seems so happy
and merry now, thank you .
- [Mr Beast] Now we're really
gonna ramp up this challenge.
Karl, Nolan open the doors.
In front of each cube is a giant button.
At some point in the next 24 hours,
this button's gonna turn green.
And whichever side presses
the green button first,
shrinks the other team's zone.
And Karl, whenever you feel like it,
change the color to green.
It's up to you.
- Do you see this?
Your foot's an inch away from the line.
- You guys have strategy?
- We have three people
that are ready to run out.
- Three?
- We all just had coffee, so we're up.
- We are jacked!
- I'm gonna change the color to blue,
and see if we can catch anybody.
- That was horrible, Karl!
- I got out.
- [Karl] You got out?
Alright, you came together.
Come on, let's do this. -
- Bye!
- There's only 50 of you left.
How many do you think are in the adults?
- I think like 60.
- Let's switch the
colors a few more times.
Then turn it green.
- I was definitely here before him though.
- They just barely beat you, I'm sorry.
- Still a letdown for my team.
I'm sorry!
- Look, they love you.
- [Nolan] It's the end of day two,
and already the kids
are down by 18 people.
- Hey everybody!
I have a new proposition.
I think we can all agree oatmeal sucks.
If you allow me to shrink your square,
I'll give you each a pizza for dinner.
- Oatmeal, all the way, until we go home.
- You have one minute to decide.
I'll be back.
- [All] Pizza, pizza!
- [All] Oatmeal. oatmeal!
- This is all I've wanted all day.
- I'm sorry, Jimmy's making me do it!
- [All] Oatmeal. oatmeal!
- All right, y'all enjoy.
- If I don't make it, this is why.
- As promised, I bring pizza!
Here you go.
I got one for each of you.
- We got a whole pizza!
- I'm gonna cry.
- Would you say this was
worth shrinking the zone?
- [Nolan] Not much happened
during the day, but at night.
- It was way harder than
I thought it was gonna be.
- It's getting smaller and smaller.
There's like no room in there.
- There's 60 adults left.
How many kids do you think are left?
- If they're getting the same oatmeal
we're getting every single day, 15 maybe.
- Oh, I think we're losing by a lot.
- [Mr Beast] By day four,
people were starting
to get really, really, really bored.
- Whoa!
- [Mr Beast] So we've decided
to give them a surprise.
- This is not a drill.
Hey, do you guys wanna pipe
to talk to your parents?
- [All] Yeah!
- Alright, bet.
- I'm so excited!
- Hi!
- Mama's still here!
- Jessica?
- She's not here!
- Really? -
- Yeah.
- Yo!
- Hello!
- That's my girl!
- I miss y'all so much!
- Hey, stay strong, stay
away from the red line.
I love you, Buddy.
- Sorry guys!
- [Mr Beast] The boys wanted
to play a little prank
to see if they could get some people out.
- This is an empty briefcase
and we're gonna bring it in there
and try to get people out with it.
Hey everybody, do you see this?
they can't handle the temptation.
- Come on, let's go this way.
Well, you just said that you were gonna
get out anyway, right?
- Yeah.
Hmm.
- They could have had 10
K, but at the same time
in all the other videos it was empty.
- I don't ever trust what
they're doing out there.
- Surely the adults are too smart
to fall for something like this.
- There's no way.
Attention!
- [Moms] What?
- [Mom] No way!
- It was just a briefcase.
- You know Jimmy said he was
only giving away the
thousand dollars once.
Nothing beyond that.
- Mm-hm.
- We're gonna do it again,
but this time it's really gonna rock.
- Why did another person leave?
- Let's see if we can go four for four.
Whoever walks out here
is straight up goofy.
- Now this time with just $1 sticking out.
- Attention!
- Bruh, why?
- Was it the dollar?
- No, I didn't even see the dollar.
- He also got out for the same thing.
But he is a kid.
- You're really just terrible.
- Me, who can blame me?
- I'm just gonna show
'em an empty briefcase
and if they walk out, so be it.
- Try to like make a
shot into the briefcase.
- I don't think they want it.
- Surely the adults
will enough confidence.
- The adults will be smarter.
- It's gonna be embarrassing.
- [Adult inside] What's in there?
- I will point out the kids
didn't fall for this one.
- Oh, I can believe that.
- Jimmy hasn't been in since yesterday.
And we heard noises on the roof,
so we're waiting to see what happens.
- Now, we're on top of the cube.
- With a balloon!
- We told the contestants
not to pop these balloons
and if they follow those
orders, they won't get punished.
- Send 'er down.
- While we wait to see
if they pop the balloon,
I wanna tell you about
our brand sponsor, Nerf.
This is the Nerf Mythic Gel Fire Blaster.
And watch this.
It shoots gel pellets!
I wish we had things like
this when we were kids.
- This is ridiculous.
- These things are crazy.
So crazy in fact, that I asked
them if I could make my own.
This is the brand new
Mr. Beast Nerf Blaster.
And as you can tell, the
hopper on ours is smoother.
It has a retractable stock,
rechargeable batteries
and you can put on semi-fire,
which shoots one at a time or full auto.
And this cartridge can
hold tons of blasts.
- Oh, they popped it already!
- Bring it closer.
A little bit closer.
We only made a limited supply of these.
So click the link in the description
and pre-order our Mr. Beast Nerf Blaster
while you still can.
- It's Nerf or nothing!
- Oh, this is so much fun.
Alright everybody, who has
the note from the balloon?
- Because you've popped the balloon,
we're going to shrink your cube.
- Nolan literally dropped it on the wall.
- So it's Nolan's fault?
- [All] Yes!
- No!
- [All] Screw Nolan!
- I cannot win.
- Hey everybody!
This is from the kids'
balloon, they popped it.
- Because you popped the balloon,
we're going to shrink your cube.
- So you guys passed the test.
But while that was going down,
someone did step on the line.
Karl, if you wanna show them the footage.
- Right there, but even afterwards,
right there your foot's on the line.
- I made y'all more money!
- Thank you for coming out, Sir!
Do you know what you're carrying?
- No! -
- A table.
- Can you follow me?
- Oh my gosh!
- What is this?
- Before I reveal this, I
need a leader real quick.
- Right here.
- I just need you to simply pick a number
between one and five.
- Two.
- Alright.
This is your cube.
This is the kid's cube.
- [Nolan] The number they
pick decides how many lines
will divide the other team's cube.
- [All] X, X, X, X, X!
- Alright!
- Pick a number between one and five.
- Three.
- Oh, okay right in the middle.
- [Jimmy] Boom!
Now let's reveal what the
adults did to your cube.
- Oh, it's not that bad.
- [Mr Beast] Even though these lines
don't take up a lot of space,
stepping over them can
cause a lot of mistakes.
- It's about to get real
stressful up in here.
- Be careful when you go to the bathroom.
- If I'm honest with you, I
wouldn't cross it that much.
Why is everybody crossing it?
- This is rough.
It's gonna be a fun night.
- Now that you just left, the
adults are done to 50 people
which means every single
person in there if they stay,
wins $10,000.
- That's fantastic.
I'm glad that I was the
one to make it happen.
- [Nolan] None of these kids
have gone to school for five days.
So I wanted to do something
special for their teacher.
- So first off, I want to apologize
for borrowing your students.
They're currently competing
for half a million dollars.
And during the challenge, I asked them
who their favorite teacher
was and they said you.
So gimme one second.
- They like math?
- I hope you like math
'cause I'm gonna need you
to count how much money this is.
- Are you kidding me?
- No.
- Are you kidding me?
- No.
I'm just gonna dump the money right here.
- If you win and you are a math student,
no homework for the rest of the year.
- Really?
- Yes.
- Okay, I'm gonna go tell them that.
- Miss Mabe, Oh god!
- She freaked out.
She also said that if you guys won,
no homework for the rest of the year.
- Woo, we're gonna win.
- [Nolan] With only two
hours left in the challenge,
I wanted to give them
something besides oatmeal.
- So this is a perfect time to see
if they like my chocolate bars.
Attention, I have Feastables.
And if you say Hershey
sucks, I'll give you one.
This is our Milk Chocolate Crunch Bar.
It's about to launch at Walmart.
- Hershey sucks, Feastables for the win.
- Agreed.
- Hershey sucks.
- I agree.
- I like Hershey's
- Which one?
- You can forget the adults.
- [All] Three, two, one!
- We're 99 hours in.
Somebody just stepped
out, a little bit ago.
We're gonna give you five grand.
Jimmy didn't give me
permission, but you know what?
Better to ask for forgiveness.
- I agree.
- There's only 30 minutes left.
- We're gonna win, we're gonna win.
- We're just praying
that there's less kids
than there is adults.
- How many adults do you think are left?
- I'd say 73.
- We have been in here for days
and I'm ready for the adults to win.
- Really curious to know what's going on
with the kids over there.
- What's the first thing you're gonna do
when you get out of here?
- Probably shower.
- The adults are gonna win.
Sorry son.
- The parents are losing this one.
- We started with a hundred
kids and a hundred adults.
I can't wait to see their
faces when they walk out.
All right.
10, nine, eight, seven, six
five, four, three, two, one!
The challenge is officially over!
Everyone, you may exit the squares.
Come out front!
And it's now time to reveal the winners.
The winner of the
challenge, by a landslide,
were the adults!
- We did it.
And as a reward for you guys
staying the entire time,
we're gonna give each of
you a thousand dollars
as a Thank you!
- So can I find my dad now?
- Oh my god, you did it Buddy!
- I don't even know how to feel.
I saw my mom.
- [Mr Beast] Yeah, go
say Hi to your parents!
- Aw, baby!
I knew you could do it!
- I missed you!
- You made it!
- Go adults, go adults, go adults!
- Woo!
- Thank you.
Thank you so much."
FD-0KG-h2-c,"I'm going to ask Gordon Ramsey which one

[Music]
more definitely yours oh really is
second off"
kX3nB4PpJko,"- I spent two and a half million dollars
on this private jet
and had 11 YouTubers
put their hands on it.
Whoever keeps their hand on the longest
wins the private jet,
but if at any point they
take their hand off,
they're eliminated.
The challenge has officially started.
The rules are simple.
You can't push someone,
and yeah, that's it.
- I've got nothing on the schedule.
I can stay here forever.
- I am willing to do anything,
including crap my own pants.
- I heard there was gonna be a lot
of loud and obnoxious
people on this shoot.
- Get off.
- No joke,
the winner of this challenge
is getting a private jet.
So of course the old tried
to find the best spot
- I'm in the best spot, the
lowest spot on the plane.
- I think I've actually got the best spot
of everyone right now.
- The jet is actually way
bigger than I thought.
Oh. Oh.
- They're making their way on
the other side of the wing-
- How am I gonna do this?
- Just slide your hand.
- Oh. Jimmy!
- So how comfortable is this position?
I almost just went like,
with my right hand.
- Oh.
- Oh my god.
- George, if you weren't
grabbing something,
I think you might have let go.
- No, I'm locked in. Don't worry.
- Yeah. What's your strategy
for winning this thing?
- I have a lot of perseverance
in my spirit, but I
I gotta be honest, Speed...
Speed is making it difficult.
- Dude, the wheels are pretty comfortable.
- I'm, yeah, you were not.
We're both logical, logical people.
- Exactly.
- I'm rested...
Oh no.
I think we might have
just got someone out.
- Oh my gosh, Vik's out.
- Did Vik just lose?
- Vik, are you out?
- He really lifted his
hand right in front of him.
- I thought this was a logical spot.
- You guys tell me what you think.
See Vik's hand right there?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- This 2.5 million jet isn't yours.
- They'll pick me up when they win.
- Goodbye, Vik.
- Vik, you got out, but who's out next?
- I think Chunkz.
- Yeah, he looks like
he's petering out there.
- I think Chunkz is ready to go home.
- Chunkz, buddy.
Word on the street is you wanna leave.
- Potentially.
- Would you get out if I
gave you my debit card?
- What, and it works?
- Yeah, of course.
- No, I swear to god, now I'm tempted.
- Oh, think of the video!
- How much can I spend?
- It'll probably stop
after ten grand, so you-
After ten grand?
- Yeah.
Oh my God!
- Here you go.
I didn't!
Shut up! I did not do it!
- Speed's gone! Speed's gone!
- I'll let you be the judge of it.
I'm gonna go forward.
- Where's the date? Where's the date?
- Bro, that's you. Five seconds ago.
So your hand comes in
the frame to high five,
and he just lifts his hand-
- Chunkz just made 10 grand,
and made Speed leave for nothing.
- I'm so disappointed.
- That is crazy.
- Oh no.
- Back to back out.
What are you looking at?
And this guy keeps following me, man.
- Bye, Speed!
- We're getting emoted on.
- Three people have been eliminated,
so I'm gonna make things harder.
Conveniently, we rented
this entire airport,
so we're gonna go for a walk.
Karl.
- Yes.
- I need you not to drive too fast.
If you get them all out now,
my video's two minutes long.
- Hey, MrBeast Shortz.
- Oh my God. Are they
about to pull the jet?
- Okay, the plane is moving.
We're moving. We're moving.
- Get comfortable, because
got a long way to go.
- No one's gonna believe
me when I told them
what we're doing.
- It's not like a private airport,
this is a commercial. I don't
understand how he's done this.
- I'm just so happy we're walking.
- Is that fast enough?
- It's a plane, mate.
- If I lose cause I'm
challenged, fair enough.
If I pull a Vik I'm fuming.
- I think my hand's slowly going numb.
- I can't believe we're actually competing
for a private jet.
- My feet are hurting.
There's a big old warehouse over there.
- Here's our next destination.
Coming up in front.
After two hours in the challenge,
the boys needed a bathroom break.
You wanna test our peeing method?
- How are we ?
- I'll be right back.
Let me introduce you guys to
the good old bucket method.
Hey, keep that hand on.
If this hand comes off, he loses.
I don't care if he's peeing.
- My...
is out now, by the way.
So don't come around, bro.
I deserve my privacy.
I missed the bucket.
I'm so sorry.
- We don't fake things around here.
Yeah, I just need a good
clean camera shot of his hand.
And throughout this entire challenge,
we have an army of people
staring at their hands.
We'll know if they come off the jet.
- My hand's got a private
jet listening to a man pee.
- Lazar. Can you come on
up to the front over here?
- Ah, how?
- I don't know. Figure it out.
- Guys. Guys, guys.
I'll give you all a ride on
my jet if you let me under.
- Since you have the most subscribers,
you pick the order we go in the jet.
- We're going in reverse order.
- No.
- It's gonna be brutal.
- I'm on the carpet.
Is it that funny, Terry?
- It's hilarious. He's
literally crawling up here.
- Please let me under. Let me under.
- I'm sorry. We're getting serious now.
- Wow.
- Might be a bit sticky though.
- Oh.
- Ooh!
- Why's your hand like that?
- What are you doing?
- It's working. Guys, please, please.
- Sorry man.
- How can I get through?
- Sorry man. You guys, don't push him off.
It's literally down to fingertips there.
- No, shut up.
- Oh, this is awful. This is awful.
- This is nice.
- Yeah.
- I could see my...
I mean, my friend flying
up in the sky in this.
- Whoever wins this jet has
to give it to someone else.
'Cause obviously these guys are YouTubers.
They don't need a private jet.
- It could be you if you
subscribe to my channel.
- If he wins.
- I'm on.
- Yeah.
- So what do you think of the jet, boys?
Solid.
- There's eight seats and eight
of you, but for us to fly,
I need to sit here, so I kind
of need someone to get out.
- Oh.
- Oh!
- Just let me know whatever
one of you wants to get out.
- All right, Jimmy!
- I left them alone in the jet for hours,
and no one got out, so I made
them do laps around the plane.
- You start going...
- Oh, what? I'm gonna
go like under the plane.
- I'm coming over here.
- Someone has to get
out. In case you forgot,
this jet is literally two
and a half million dollars.
These boys got a lot on the line.
- My hand goes off this, I'm done.
- Don't worry, man.
You're just winging it.
- Never speak to me again, please.
- I'm not getting back on that
plane until someone's lost.
- You need to entice
these guys to leave, man.
- Why? I don't need to.
When you're sleepy, it's game over.
- It's Will. I'm telling you.
Will is the one to go for.
He's cracking.
- 20K. I'll go.
- I heard some deals are happening.
What's going on?
They've offered me 20 K from the winner,
if I take my hand off now.
- The winner wins a jet. Not money.
- Are you fine with us making that deal?
- Yeah, if you guys pay him 20 grand.
- Yeah.
- Oh!
- All right, thank you for...
Oh my god. That hand's sweaty.
Now that Will is out,
that means we can fly the jet around.
Everyone, get in the jet.
This is nice.
- The inside, the only thing in play
is the exterior.
The chairs and stuff
like that do not count.
- I'm gonna be honest. I think I'm out.
- What'd you do?
- The chair.
- Oh, that's honest of you though.
- Ready?
No, it's got a good angle.
- Definitely not on the wood.
- At least he was honest,
he ratted on himself.
- Thank you, Jimmy.
- No problem. A bit sweaty.
- I know, it hasn't come off the jet.
- Let's see this bad boy in the air.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Be on our way fairly shortly.
- On our way where, can I ask?
- Yeah, just, just lay back.
- I'll chill out. I'll chill.
- I really hope you guys didn't, you know,
when you had your hands
on the outside the plane,
mess anything up.
- What you mean?
- Oh, come on.
- I don't know. I'm just saying.
- If this plane crashes,
do I get to keep all of their channels?
- Always says the wildest stuff before we-
- That did not sound good.
- This is it.
- There she goes.
- In case you're
wondering, this jet works.
- Harry's face kills me.
- It feels wrong.
It feels like a tin can.
Anything could hit us out the sky.
- Boys. What way are we going?
- There's a lot of lights that way.
So that could be London.
So we could be going...
I've got nothing.
- It's just so funny seeing the wing
you guys were just slapping...
- Speed was-
- Oh! Oh!
- We've just got on the flight
and his hand's come off.
And the best part is,
he has to fly to the next destination
and back with us out after he's out.
After over an hour in the air,
I still didn't tell them
where we were going.
We may or may not be landing soon.
Where do you think we are?
- I have no idea.
- Dublin.
- Liverpool.
- Milan.
- Look for the Eiffel Tower.
- Ireland.
- Scotland.
- I reckon
it's Southend Airport. I
reckon we just did a lap.
- Where are we?
- Where you think about Beast?
- Oh, whoa.
- Whoa.
- That's the hangar.
We just did a lap.
- That's right.
I just told the pilot
to fly around in circles
for a couple hours.
Oh, thank god.
- Congratulations, you got pranked.
We went in a circle.
Boys, come on out. This is
where the real fun begins.
Everyone's tired. They're freezing.
The challenge is gonna get interesting.
- In the hangar we go. Again.
- It's time to feed the contestants.
I bought things like steak and spaghetti
that are really hard to eat with one hand.
- Oh, is that spaghetti?
- A wooden fork? For a steak.
- After dinner,
I have a special surprise for all of you.
See you in a bit.
- Special surprise?
Imagine he says someone's out.
""I hope you enjoyed that meal.""
We're down to the final five.
It's time we get serious.
I need you guys to pair
up into groups of two.
I'm saying no more.
- Oh, there's only five of us.
- Brother. Yes?
- Me and you both.
Me and you. Come on, we've got this.
- I'm alone. I've been ditched.
- Karl, you know what to do.
- Left hands
Put 'em together.
- Oh, what is this?
- I feel like I might have
gotten away with something,
but I don't know what's coming.
Is something happening bad to me?
- Come here, George.
- I don't know if this is even fair.
They can move their arm.
I can't move my arm.
Oh George. No George.
- I'll just sit here.
- If Lazar wins, a nine
year old kid gets the jet.
If Niko wins, his editor gets the jet.
- When I was five, I was really ill.
I had leukemia, so I'm gonna find someone,
and try and give them the
start that I didn't have
after that.
- Wow.
- Yeah, I was trying to change-
- So you'll find someone
who recovers from leukemia,
give them a jet?
- Yeah.
I'm gonna try my best.
- I would find someone who's
willing to sell the jet,
and then donate all that
money to a children's charity.
- Really?
- No.
- We are bonded forever after this.
Is this all right?
- Me and Mr. Lazar have
found the best position.
- I met you 24 hours ago. Now look at us.
- Lean your head on my
chest, turn to the side,
yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Aw, man.
- There you go.
- How's it going on down there?
- Our little .
- This is literally the biggest
prize I've ever given away,
and they're starting to get
a little too comfortable.
I banned the wings to make it harder,
but it doesn't seem like that's working.
They have 60 seconds to stand up.
- I think I know what's
coming and it's not good.
- Okay, everyone is standing again.
- Yes. Let's go with the routine.
- Since nobody was getting out,
I'm gonna bring out the red tape.
I decided to give them
even less room on the jet.
If you touch the red line, or go below it,
you are out, starting now.
We're in this together.
Let's see how badly they want this jet.
- You allowed to do that?
- What?
- Hold your hand.
- Why not?
- No wonder you haven't moved.
You've been holding it in place.
- We've been doing this
for like an hour now,
and everyone is still
kind of going strong.
I guess Harry's looking a bit wobbly.
- It's 5:00 AM I think I'm
more tired than they are.
- We have a proposition.
I'm gonna coin flip this
young gentleman over here.
Whoever loses takes
their hand off the jet.
- Heads, you stay on, tails you stay on,
a $2.5 million jet on the line.
- Oh my God.
- Oh hell, watch out.
Oh!
- Get off the jet.
- It's on heads.
- Get off the jet!
- Is he a man of his word?
- Oh!
- How does it feel to be free?
- It's very not...
But I miss him, man. I miss my boy.
- I believe in you.
Harry. Hold that hand up.
See you later.
- Little bit.
- See ya, boys. I'm going to bed.
- I wish I could.
To celebrate Callux getting out,
I say we make it harder.
Everyone pick a finger.
- This beauty here.
- As of now, that is, is all that matters.
- I'm gonna go with the pointer.
- Okay. Pointer as well.
Everyone's pointer finger.
From now on, that is the
only finger that matters,
till you guys start dropping.
- I'm not good.
- It's so difficult now.
- This is painful. I'm only 10 seconds in.
- I have the benefit of
this other hand there.
- We need to get our tape
off to be fair with Harry.
- Give it like 30 minutes and
I'll cut all the tape off.
- Can I coin flip it?
Take my tape off if I get heads?
- If you'll leave. Sure.
- Let's flip the coin. Heads, take it off.
I'm doing this for you, Niko.
- Tails. That means he's out.
- I didn't have a chance
unless we took this tape off.
Oh, I'm sorry Niko. You've
gotta take it home, buddy.
It's for Niko.
- It's for Niko.
- Oh my God.
- Take it home, buddy.
- I'll let you pick.
Do we make George wait the 30 minutes,
or do I cut him out now?
- I wanna see a fair ending.
Take it off. Take it off.
- Okay, I appreciate that.
- I wanna see a of willpower.
- Good luck.
Keep your finger on the jet.
- This is what I needed for me to win.
- It's gonna be so
disrespectful when you lose.
- If you win.
Who is getting this jet?
- I think it's just
gonna have to be my mom.
I've got no one else.
- I really want to give
it to my editor, George.
- We should call your editor.
George. What's up man?
- Oh my gosh.
- Now, Niko is saying that if he wins,
he's giving this jet to you.
Do you have any words of
encouragement for Niko?
- Encouragement is you've gone this far.
You can go the extra mile.
- Thank you, George. Thank you.
- I'm gonna split it between
my brother and my sister.
- Oh really?
- I grew up with them, man,
so I wanna try and give
them something special.
The sun's coming through out there.
I'm seeing daylight.
That's the only way we can
actually tell the time.
This is very tough.
- My arm is dying.
- You ready to make this a little harder?
I need you to face that direction.
Oh look, I've done it.
- Yeah yeah. There you go.
- I'm like losing...
- Oh, I should just gone like that.
- Yeah. There we go.
Niko is struggling here.
- Just get out already.
- I can't.
- Come on.
- Now's not the time, Nolan.
- I left them alone for a while
and then we caught something
on one of our cameras.
- One of you-
- Oh no, oh no...
- has gotten out.
Who do you think it is?
- It's me!
- Someone go review his footage.
It was not, I got something
I need to show you.
Is that your hand?
- Maybe?
- Is that your hand?
- That is my hand.
- It was literally off, for
no joke, one singular frame.
- I gotta take my hand off?
- Well, I mean you can leave it on,
but you're not winning the jet, man.
Aw, guys.
- There was clear airspace. Wow.
Well played, guys.
- It is now down to George and Harry.
- I want you to check though.
- I'm going to check Harry.
- Can't believe I was
this close to win it.
Who do I think's gonna win?
I feel like-
- Who do you think's gonna win?
What do you mean?
How about here's who did win.
Don't tell 'em who it is.
Gentlemen. The challenge
is officially over.
- No, I know when it happened,
a minute before you came
out, it skipped over, no!
- Harry.
- No!
- I'm sorry man.
But you can go ahead and
take your finger off.
If you look right here.
See that finger?
- Mhm.
- It's not Harry's.
It's actually George's.
- No.
- Wait. You're trolling.
You actually trolled me.
- Yeah. Harry?
You just won!
- Yes! Come on!
Oh yeah!
- George, you were this close.
- What?
- But close doesn't matter.
Harry just won this jet!
- Yes!
- Oh, you're all so sweaty.
Congratulations. Who are
you giving the jet to?
My brother and my sister.
Let's go to them right now.
- Three, two, one.
- No no no no...
- I swear to God.
Subscribe to MrBeast. He's a legend.
Buy all his chocolate and stuff.
- Everything.
- And in case you're wondering
we're gonna offset all the carbon emitted
during the filming of
this video by tenfold.
And we're also gonna offset
any future carbon emitted
by the winner of this jet."
iogcY_4xGjo,"- I rented a $1 million a night hotel room
and I also rented this
$1,000 a night cave,
this $10,000 a night underwater palace,
this $50,000 a night island,
and so much more.
And we're gonna spend
the night in all of them
starting with the world's cheapest hotel
all the way in India.
Basically, you can rent
these mats for $1 a night.
So, I'm gonna give you guys a room tour.
See this mat right here?
This is my entire room for the night.
Oh!
It's just like my mattress at home,
minus the comfort.
So what's the room service like?
- Bro, it's a dollar.
While we were trying to sleep,
people kept stepping over us
in the middle of the night.
- Hey
- Hey.
- If you didn't believe
we're in a hallway,
there you go.
These are the price points of
all the hotels we're visiting,
and it gets really crazy
towards the end of the video.
That was the $1 hotel.
Now let's head over to
the $1,000 a night hotel.
It comes with two beds,
a living room,
one bathroom.
You could see me while I pee.
And it's 200 feet below ground.
We literally have this
entire cave to ourselves.
- Are there bats here?
- No, but the bed does have stains on it.
- Hey, I'm gonna be honest with you,
at least it's better
than a pad in a hallway.
- Apparently, caves don't have Wi-Fi.
- We're gonna have to
enjoy each other's company?
- So, Chris just got up and left.
Where'd Chris go?
- It's getting a little creaky.
That actually kinda
looks like the entrance
to a horror movie.
Yeah, I think this is
where we call it a day.
- As the night went on,
the boys discovered a
keyboard right beside my bed.
Oh, no way.
Turn the volume up.
Oh, I can perform for you guys!
- They won't let me sleep.
Go away, shut up.
- Have you seen my funny bone?
- Someone help me.
Turns out there's not
much else to do in a cave.
Now we really start ramping up.
And now we're at the
$10,000 a night villa.
- Whoo!
- This place is huge.
Boys, let me do the honors.
- Allow him.
- Oh!
- Oh, my gosh.
This place is nice.
For $10,000 a night,
you get three bedrooms.
- Could've done without the
entire forest on my bed.
- What's wrong with a little shrubbery?
- Bathtubs by the ocean.
- Oh, my God.
It looks like Chipotle bowl.
- It does look like Chipotle bowl.
- Access to a private dock.
- Look at that.
Is this an infinity pool?
- Yes, look.
It's infinite.
- Unlimited food prepared
by a private chef.
Let's see if the pizza tastes expensive.
- Oh my god.
This takes hotels to the next level.
- And this isn't even the best part.
Behind this door is why
this costs 10 grand.
- Oh my God!
- The underwater villa.
- I feel like I'm in a fishbowl.
- We are in a room at
the bottom of the ocean.
- Wow, look at those fish!
This was worth $10,000.
The fish sell it.
- Which do you like better?
The cave or this?
- It's gonna be this.
- Look, look at that one!
- Oh my god!
Hello, sir.
- Guys, there's an underwater bathroom.
- What?
- I can shower underwater.
- Chris, what are you doing?
- I feel like an evil villain
contemplating world domination
in my underwater base.
Guys, I have an idea.
Stay right here.
I'll be back.
- This isn't gonna be good.
Oh, there he is!
- No way.
- Chris!
- Oh my gosh.
- It's a Chris fish.
Chris!
This is epic!
That's a cool looking fish.
- As a part of this $10,000 package-
- Yeah, this is is so cool.
He like floating in the air.
- We got jet skis and water jet packs
for the whole afternoon.
- This is the greatest hotel in the world!
- We're now eating in an
underwater restaurant.
Shark!
- Shark!
- Oh my gosh.
- Now we eat fish surrounded by fish.
- That doesn't feel right.
- Honestly, fish tastes better underwater.
- I just wanna make you guys aware
that this is just the beginning.
We have a $50,000, $150,000,
and a million dollar night stay coming up.
- How can you afford this?
- I'm just gonna lose a
million dollars in this video.
It's finally time to go to bed.
I laid claim to the fish room,
and not gonna lie,
it's kinda trippy just
being surrounded by fish.
- We still have so many hotels to go to.
- Exactly why we need to get some sleep.
- All right, good night.
- And that was the $10,000 a night hotel.
Up next, we have a beautiful
$50,000 private island,
and a $50 bus.
And I had the boys randomly
pick which they're staying at.
- Ah! Enjoy your bus!
- While we were on our way to
the $50,000 a night island,
I caught something insane on my drone.
It's a whale.
- No.
- Oh my God.
Whoa, I got a really good shot of it.
Whoa!
- mom!
- Dude.
- I thought the 50 grand
was getting me a island.
How many is included?
- 14.
- All 14 we can explore?
- All 14 you can explore.
- This is crazy.
- Are they just here
waiting until we show up?
- How are you?
- How long have you been standing here?
- Two years.
- No, how long have
you been standing here?
- Since eight o'clock in the morning.
- I feel bad.
- Oh look, this isn't a bus,
it's a home.
Chandler, you're not gonna
be able to stand, by the way.
I don't believe that
this was actually $50.
$50.
- In addition to 14 islands,
we have 12 houses,
five swimming pools,
and 110 staff on the island waiting on us.
Wait, what did you just say?
There's 110 people
that take care of the three of us?
- Yup.
- I feel so special.
- Apparently up the side
of this little mountain
is our little casitas.
- Here we are, welcome home.
- Holy crap.
This is crazy.
- Is this Nolan's room?
- Yeah.
- Nolan!
- I'm not next to this goofball am I?
- Nolan!
- And you indoor/outdoor shower.
- Wait, so I can shower with
this door to outside open?
- Yeah.
- So what are we supposed to do?
- I don't know.
- Usually, we would do
like a tour of the place
but you can literally see it
all from where we're sitting.
Let's see if we can drive this baby.
I don't think it works.
- Back on the island, we had lunch.
Wow, that takes dessert to the next level.
Relaxed on a private beach.
I haven't felt this peaceful
in a very long time.
Took a ride on a private plane.
And we ate even more food.
Bro, they just keep giving us great food.
I decided to give Chris
and Chandler a call
to check in on them.
What up, Chris?
- Hey, what's up?
- I'm just gonna say it,
this $50,000 a night island is insane.
- The bus is hot,
it doesn't even start,
and there's only one bed!
- Sounds like they're
having an amazing time.
We'll check in on you
guys in a couple hours.
- Hey, check-
- I guarantee you he was gonna say,
""Hey, check in on these nuts.""
Play what he just said.
- Hey, check in on these nuts.
- Dang.
- All right, we gotta eat something.
- Yeah, we do.
- I got an idea.
- Somehow, the boys convinced the owner
of the Airbnb to tow their bus.
- I'm surprised this is going really well.
- And we settled down for
an eight course dinner
on the beach.
What is this?
- This is octopus carpaccio.
- Octopus carpaccio?
- Oh!
- Oh.
- Oh!
Oh my god!
- This place is amazing!
- Oh my gosh, we're here.
- This crab is fancy.
- This crab is eating better than Chris.
- All right, we got our McDonald's.
Time to get in the bus and
go back to the campsite.
- Go back home.
- What an incredible day.
Probably one of the most fun
I've ever had in my life.
As you can see by our list,
we're starting to get to the big stuff.
These next few is where
the video gets interesting.
Up next, I've rented
this entire cruise ship.
This behemoth usually
holds thousands of people.
But for only $75,000,
you can have it all to yourself.
But I only have it for one hour,
'cause it's a $500 million cruise ship.
And to make this one hour fun,
I hid a hundred thousand dollars randomly
throughout the cruise ship.
Whatever you guys find,
you can keep.
That's your signal to run.
- Let's go!
- And while he's looking for money,
I wanna tell you about Experian.
- I go from here.
You go from there?
- Experian is a free app
that helps you take
control of your credit.
Whether you have $1 or $1 million.
- Nothing? Nothing.
Every corner.
- I don't think Jimmy
put money in the trash.
- Let's see.
- Let's go, let's go!
- I find one!
- Woo!
$10,000, let's go.
- All right, that's a good start.
- Experian is a free and easy way
to check your credit report,
your FICO score,
and so much more.
- Okay, let me find this $10,000 check.
I got one!
Okay.
- He's got more?
- I found two already.
- Hey, come over here.
Did you know with the Experian boost,
you can leverage things
like your utility bill,
your cell phone bill,
even your Netflix bill to
boost your credit score?
- Yep.
- Did you actually?
- Yeah!
- Oh wow.
Okay, he knows everything.
And by the way,
I was holding one of the checks.
Here you go.
- I'm so nervous, sorry.
- Well, go find more!
And it gets even better
because now, you can even be
rewarded for paying your rent.
- Did you see any white board big check?
Nothing?
- He's a professional
at finding big checks.
- Oh wait.
- Woo!
- Somehow, after helping
us pay for these hotels,
it is still free to
download and sign up for.
Just click the link in the description
and download Experian right now.
How much did you guys find?
- 30? 40,000.
- I love how they don't even
know how much money they found.
With only two hotels left to go,
I met up with the boys in Vegas.
Now we're at the 150 K
a night hotel package
at the Palms Hotel Resort in Las Vegas.
There are three rooms.
A bowling themed room,
a basketball themed room,
and an art themed room with
stuff from this famous artist,
Damien Hirst.
We're gonna let Chandler
and our special guest pick the first room.
Which one do you want?
- Basketball.
- Here you go.
Have fun boys.
In my opinion,
Gravy and Chandler had the best room.
- This is beautiful.
- They had a secret gaming room.
- There's a hidden room.
- I was just gonna say,
like, I can just feel it.
It's a door!
- They literally had their own butler.
- I'm a lucky butler.
- And to top it all off,
they had their own basketball court.
- We made it.
- Which room do you two want?
- Bowling!
- Yeah!
- You sure?
- Yes.
- Which means me and you, Chris,
are stuck with the medicine room.
I Googled the medicine room
and it doesn't look fun.
- I wanted to bowl.
- Kingpin suite!
Yo wait, this is actually ridiculous.
Strike.
Strike, baby!
You can't do that!
It's against the rules.
That is not how this game works.
- I won by seven points!
- No!
- Where are the beds?
Whoa, there's more!
- Bunk beds!
- Bunk beds, yes!
Nolan, we picked the perfect room.
- Let's check out the medicine room.
This room has over $16 million
worth of art inside of it.
And Chris has no idea.
This is a million dollar piece of art.
- It looks like my
grandma's medicine cabinet.
- When I rented this room,
they said, ""Whatever you do,
""do not touch this.""
If you try to open it,
a security guard will come up.
Don't touch it!
How much do you think this
collection of pills costs?
- $37.
- 3.5 million.
It's a piece of art.
- It's a piece of something.
- It says this pool table was 2.3 million.
- Are you serious?
- No, it's a normal pool table.
- Oh, okay.
- I love how they're having fun bowling
and playing basketball,
and we're just like
scared to touch anything.
Included in the 150 K package
is the $10,000 dinner.
- Wow.
- By the way, Chris,
how was that bus?
You never told me.
- I got bit in the face by mosquitoes.
- While that was happening,
I was getting a massage.
How does this compare to the other hotels?
- 10 out out of 10
- Oh!
- It's been a beautiful
little meal, you know.
- Hey, cheers.
- I think we can all
agree this meal was great.
But the night's not over.
After an amazing dinner,
me and the boys hung
out in the bowling room.
This is called, The Quad Bowl.
Hey!
- Oh!
- Whoa, we still didn't get a strike.
- Yeah!
- I think every hotel room
should have a bowling alley.
This $150,000 hotel package was insane.
I don't know how this
million dollar a night hotel
can get any better.
And now the moment you've
all been waiting for,
the $1 million a night castle.
- Dibs on that one.
- Let's knock and see what happens.
- How's it going?
- Hi.
- Hello, everybody!
- As soon as we walked in,
they gave us each our very own butler.
- Nice to meet you.
- There's a lot of people.
- Yo, what's up man?
I'm digging the hair.
This is sick.
- Come on up, enjoy the castle.
- Whoa, you gotta split the staircase?
What the heck?
- We're off to a good start.
They make foosball tables this long?
- They do when you're in
a million dollar castle.
- Hey, Nolan.
See that ball there?
Ah!
- Our goal is to give you all
a million dollar experience
for the next 24 hours.
- This place has six Diamond stars.
I didn't think it went above five.
- Way more important than that?
- Yeah.
- Come with me right now.
- It gets better.
- It's a dude with milkshakes.
- Oh my gosh!
- This is worth the
million dollars for me now.
- What the heck is this?
Is that a robot?
- There's literally just dudes
breakdancing here all day?
This is sick.
- After we saw as much as we could-
- No!
- They're gonna teach you
how to do this, Jimmy.
- Wow.
They showed us to our rooms.
Show me to my quarters.
Thank you.
- Here you are.
- Thank you.
- Yeah!
- I guarantee you,
if you cut to Karl,
he's gonna say something about
sitting in a bathtub tonight.
- Oh my god,.
I'm a bath guy.
This is ridiculous.
- The boys wanted to explore the castle,
but I had something else planned.
And before we go crazy,
I have a surprise for you guys.
Bring it in!
- Bring what in?
- Welcome!
Thanks for subscribing.
Come on out.
What up, man?
How's it going?
Since you guys are the reason
we're able to afford this
castle for the night,
we invited four random
subscribers to hang out with us.
Everyone pair up and go have fun!
Enjoy the million dollar a night hotel.
- We're trying to pick out a car, Jimmy.
Shut up.
- Okay.
- I'm gonna die.
I do not do heights.
- Let's see it!
- Wow, Jesus!
- Come back, come back!
- Oh my gosh!
I did it!
Oh my god, that was awesome!
- That was pretty cool.
- That was the most epic
thing I've ever done!
- Look at all these horsies.
- Have you ever ridden a horse before?
- No, I've never seen a horse.
- I'm sorry.
How is this happening?
- How ridiculous is it
that we have these gigantic horses
next to this gigantic castle, right?
- You wanna go in?
- Yeah.
- Karl, you're literally riding a horse
in a castle right now.
- So unreal.
- Oh my gosh.
Wait, why?
- It was an option so I figured, why not?
- Hey, we're driving here!
Oh, you feel that power?
- I'm in a McLaren!
- Chris and his subscriber decided
to drive a $300,000 car to McDonald's.
- Hello.
Guys it's me, Chandler, from Mr. Beast.
- I wanna be in a Mr. Beast video.
- Oh my God, you just were.
- Chandler!
A membership to this course
costs $57,000 a year.
- And I'm playing for free right now.
- 'Cause I spent a million dollars.
- I'm playing for free.
- Why a long face?
Ted, please.
I just wanna go one foot forward.
- Okay, Santa Fe, go!
- I like cars more.
- I wonder, what does a $1
million a night dinner look like?
I love how because we're all here,
all our butlers are just
standing over there.
You guys can chill.
You don't have to be so uptight.
Just sit down,
get comfortable.
How does this castle compare
to all the other places?
- Best food? Vegas.
- Agreed.
- Okay, best hotel?
The private island wins for me.
- Didn't see it.
Saw a bus.
And the lamp doesn't work.
And the AC.
- My favorite was the
$50,000 private island.
Oh my gosh! Whoa!
This place is amazing.
And you know when you're
paying this much for dinner,
it's gonna come with a show.
- This is crazy.
Wow.
- I'm starting to get why
this is a million dollars.
- I don't even know what to think.
Rich people are crazy.
And after that was done,
they gave us a grand finale.
See all those green dots out there?
Those are drones.
All right.
They're going up.
- This is incredible.
- Oh my god, they are dabbing!
- Oh!
- No!
- Oh my gosh!
- What's he doing to that guy?
It's a briefcase full of money!
- This is insane.
Yo, fireworks better
count their days, bro.
Wow.
- Oh no.
Why?
- Oh my gosh, bro.
I know this doesn't look real,
but that is real.
- That was great.
We spent weeks traveling
all over the world.
I hope you guys enjoyed
and learned something.

gHzuabZUd6c,"I laid a giant circle in the middle of nowhere, and this is a random
subscriber, and if he stays in this circle for 100 days, I'll give him
$500,000. Step inside the circle, and the 100 day counter will start.
The timer is ticking.
He has to survive in the circle for 100 days.
There's nothing here.
There's nothing yet.
Chris! I'm about to drop off a house.
This definitely gives me more confidence.
I bet you didn't know you could lift a house with a crane.
And that's zero training.
Wait, which one's the gas again? Watch out for the stairs!
You know what, actually.
And inside this house is all the food, clothes, and supplies he needs to
survive 100 days.
Oh, no.
This could have been a lot worse.
Oh, my God.
And this is Shawn's family.
I wanted to let you guys get one final goodbye in before he started the
challenge. No pain no gain, dad.
You guys will be here when I walk out of that circle with a half
million dollars.
But I'm gonna miss you guys.
Aw. I'm gonna cry a little bit.
Okay. The video just started, and it's already emotional.
Good luck.
$500,000 is on the line.
To be honest, it's a little emotional, but 300,000 calories, 100 days.
Get the food organized, clothing figured out, figure out a way to keep my
mind entertained, and I know if I walk out of that circle, I will regret it
forever. One night down, 99 to go.
Let's go get organized.
All right, strategy session number one.
I gotta figure out what I got, how much I got, and what I'm gonna do to
organize it.
This is all the food you're getting for the next hundred days.
So if you eat all this in the first, let's say, 50 days, you're done.
It looked like a lot more food until I started condensing it down.
Shawn. Hello.
We have over a dozen cameras monitoring his every move 24/7 if he steps on
that red line, we will see it.
What do you think the hardest part of this challenge will be? Solo failure.
No one beats me.
I didn't get outplayed.
He's still talking to us, and we're outside the trailer.
Being in my own head.
Hey, Shawn.
I think they walked away.
God, I hate them.
Because Chris dropped my house so perfectly, my shower doesn't drain.
Huge shout out, Chris.
Really appreciate 100 days of dealing with this.
It's cloudy, so I think it's a perfect day to get outside and try to plant
some vegetables.
Oh, I gotta pay attention where I'm walking.
Cause if I walk across that game over, that red line is death.
If I touch it, it's over.
So I'm gonna take the wood out back and create kind of like a secondary
line. All right.
Now I got my beautiful circle. Shawn.
Come in.
How's it going, man? Doing good.
Wait a minute.
Is this a cheerio? This is all you get for 100 days.
You're wasting a cheerio.
All right.
Wow, it's really stale.
I'm shocked at how fast Shawn is developing a routine.
It is officially day ten.
Sorry I'm dressed like this.
I just gave away a chocolate factory.
Shawn is nowhere to be seen on these cameras.
Shawn, are you pooping? What? What? Okay.
He didn't run away.
Bro, how you doing? Good.
Give me a hug.
All right.
Wait, so you're tracking your weight? I'm weighing in every seven days.
So you're trying to just be jacked by the end? Yeah.
So, I mean, at the end of it, I'll be ripped and $500,000 richer.
Your wife's gonna love me.
You seem to be doing really well.
I'll see you in a month.
A month? I think he's kidding, but he's probably not.
I'm gonna try to build a garden today.
I'm gonna try to replant it away from that crazy red line.
One of the things I plan on doing with the money is to put my farm 100% on solar
power. My farm will be like a giant Tesla.
That's the dream.
That's what we're trying to do at the homestead.
Can't wait to get out and get my money.
And I'm gonna go on a nice vacation for a while, I think.
Whoa. Jimmy just told me there's a tornado watch.
Are you gonna leave the circle for the severe weather? I'm like, I'm from
Oklahoma. Whoa.
There's no way that tarp is worth a half million dollars.
Oh, yeah, here it comes.
My poor money's blowing away.
Okay, I'm going inside.
I have water peeing from the ceiling.
My toilet won't flush because I'm guessing the tank out there is full of
water from the rain leaking into it.
You guys see that gentleman behind us? He's been in that circle for 16 days.
That's longer than you went without eating, bald guy.
You didn't have to bring up that video.
Have you seen your second floor yet? No, I've been trying to get up there.
It's a bit steep.
Hey, Jimmy, you're bald.
Yeah, I'm just gonna stay out of it.
I feel like if I stay in here, they will bother each other and not me.
Since the boys are being rude, I'm gonna leave them trapped.
We want out.
I will bring the ladder back if you just apologize.
Run it down.
I think we're ready to get out.
I want an apology.
I'm sorry you're bald.
I'm sorry I called you bald.
Was it that hard? Yeah, it hurt.
So the boys made quite the mess of my house yesterday.
My yard is now covered in glass.
Very frustrating.
I'm worried this challenge might be getting
to Shawn. Would you come into my house and screw with stuff? I don't think
so.
This thing just smacked me in the nuts.
How you doing, Chandler? Scared. I would be too.
We installed that ferris wheel in 2 hours.
Get me down. Shawny.
To celebrate you being 25% done.
We brought you a carnival so you can enjoy the day.
This is awesome.
Nothing but net.
Aw. Bruh.
Oh, first throw.
There we go.
This mini game isn't very fun.
Oh, my gosh.
I'm so terrified of heights.
You're 25 days in.
Do you still think you're gonna make it the full hundred? I can't see why not.
This competition's a huge sacrifice.
I only get so many summers with my kids, right? Before they're gone and out of
the house, so that's tough.
So I was organizing all my clothes, and as I was going through it, I started
finding little notes from my daughter, my youngest.
I have four kids and a wife, and this will be the most alone I've been in 18
years. Rationing food.
Survival is gonna be rough, but if anything makes me walk out of here, it's
gonna be the loneliness.
I just don't want to think about it.
All I know is Gordon Ramsay, he ain't got nothing on me. Because I only gave him
300,000 calories of food.
Shawn really had to think about how he rationed it, which led to some pretty
interesting choices.
So this may be my first bad one.
It's just a bunch of leftovers.
Boiled for safety.
It's disgusting.
Very cabbagey.
There's a camera above me.
I'm not sleeping naked during this 100 day challenge, Jimmy.
Just know I did that for you.
Just to spare you from my nakedness.
This morning, I heard, hey, Shawn, there's a spider in your bed.
My bed is now flipped over.
I'm leaving the circle.
This is my last day.
You know, you've been here a long time.
When living inside of a circle in a MrBeast video seems normal.
Day 39.
It's father's day.
I kept waking up thinking I was home, really missing my family.
This is gonna be a tough day.
And what Shawn didn't know is that I brought his family to the circle to
surprise him for Father's day.
Shawn, I have a present for you.
Oh, yeah?
Happy Father's Day.
Almost makes me feel bad for trapping him in here.
They didn't really consult with me.
They just brought a present.
And I'm not about to tell this little girl she can't give her dad a present,
so I caved.
And here you go.
Oh, okay.
I appreciate it.
Oh, my God.
Not only did they give you a gift, but they also get to spend the next 24
hours with you.
No way.
You guys are gonna be so bored.
Are those my drawings on the fridge? Yeah.
So your drawings on the fridge.
Nice. I didn't think he would keep these.
Oh, it's the wife.
It had nearly been a month since Shawn saw his family, so I decided to give
them some privacy until the next day.
It must be nice to be able to walk out of the red circle.
Really appreciate it, Jimmy.
That was the best.
It's a new day, and Ryan is here, who traveled across America to give me
this penny.
Hey, guys.
Shawn, I'm coming in.
Come on in.
Do you know what he's carrying? A penny.
Do you know why he's carrying this penny? My kids told me all about this.
Wait, really? Yeah.
Oh, no.
I'm gonna give it to you for entertainment.
Really? Here you go.
Tomorrow's day number 50, and we have a big surprise for him.
But don't tell him, okay? Okay.
Okay. All right.
It is officially day 50 of Shawn surviving in the circle.
And I invited some of my YouTube friends to celebrate this special moment.
It's us his YouTube friends.
I need a break.
Shawn. Shawn, what day is it? 50? Exactly.
In front of you is $100,000 in cash.
And if you get out right now, I'll let you keep it.
No. Why 100 grand? I can just chill here and get another 400.
All right, what if it was, like, 150 grand? Would it still be enough? I
think, like, above 400, I would think... You're crazy!
400. Okay, well, in case you did say yes, I invited a marching band.
Bring in the marching band.
Hey, do you want to know what the best part about this is? I paid them to be
here all night.
Good luck.
For the first 50 days, I wanted to see if Shawn could make it.
I've done this, right? I've done 50 days.
For the last half of this challenge, we have some pretty crazy stuff
planned. This is probably something you'll never see.
Oh, my God.
Honestly, I didn't think it was gonna end like this.
July 4th. Day 54.
Happy birthday, America.
You guys ready? They're lighting them.
They're lighting.
They lit.
Go, go.
What if you got out right now? Gotta watch out for the circle.
No, it's not.
I just bought random fireworks.
I didn't know they were that crazy.
Cease fire.
Cease fire.
I can't even see.
Is that a good show or what? Honestly, we should become firework experts.
Yeah, dude, I basically am.
All right, Shawn, more importantly, it is now July 5, which means we need to
leave. Yeah.
More fireworks.
We're not gonna celebrate anything on July 5.
Okay. Thank you.
I'm a little terrified of what Jimmy comes up with next.
Did you say you're terrified? Of what I'm gonna come up with next? Yes.
Do you want me to just leave you alone for a month? No, that'd be even worse.
Okay see you in a month. That's, like, almost all the days that are left.
Here's the aftermath.
There's multiple times where I was way too close to the edge.
So I'm thinking about digging a moat.
If Jimmy's really not coming back for 30 days, I should have an entire moat
built by time he gets back.
Today, I eat a can of mixed vegetables and a can of turkey.
I didn't even heat it up.
Food is going to be an issue.
This is meat, and it smells.
And I've kind of tapped out the things to do inside the 60 foot circle.
I dug a moat, made a garden, made a fire pit, which is too hot to use.
Made like a fence around the back and made a hammock.
So I'm just here existing.
I don't feel like doing really anything, so I'm just going to sleep.
That is Shawn's house, and I haven't been there in 30 days.
Let's see if he's still alive.
Just kidding.
I check in on the cameras every single day.
I know he's alive.
Looks like he dug a moat around the circle.
Let's see how he's doing.
Hey, buddy.
Hey. Did you miss me? Yes.
Well, does it feel refreshing? It's like seriously shaking.
You're that excited to see us? No, definitely.
Wow. I had no idea that not visiting Shawn for 30 days would affect him this
much. Oh, you do look much thinner.
Did you lose weight? I'm 22 pounds down.
Wow. We've done a lot since you last saw me.
What did you do? And this is my storm window.
And I sit here and watch the storm come in and listen to the lightning.
Proud of you.
Thank you.
Things are about to start ramping up.
The last ten days are gonna be crazy.
What'd you say? Don't worry about it.
Honestly, I thought the 30 day challenge was kind of like my hard challenge,
but it sounds like he's not done with me, which is a little concerning.
Shawn, what's the best way to cut a cake in half? With a knife.
Okay, what's the best way to cut a house in half? Oh, shoot.
Look. He keeps checking all the windows to see if we're gonna cut the house
in half.
Look at that.
He's gonna be so confused until I return tomorrow.
So I was calling Jimmy's bluff on this, but then I just look outside.
I need you to cut it in half and get rid of that half.
You're legit gonna cut my house in half?
I just learned how to drive this five minutes ago.
Yeah. I just wanna tell you that it's only gonna get harder.
That's what I'm worried about.
No. Wow.
Oh, my God.
I didn't think this would actually work.
Ah. Oh, my God.
You're good.
Oh, my God.
In a couple days, we may or may not just burn the house down.
If I do anything, I'll let you double for him.
Okay. Yeah.
Thank you.
That was a rough day.
It's nine days to go.
At this point, I don't even care.
I don't even want to talk about how long I've been here.
Well played, Jimmy.
Well played.
I'm staying.
So it's officially hotter in my room than it is outside at this point.
Shawn, I will give you a quarter of a million dollars if you get out right
now. You know, it's hot.
I want to give you a way out.
It's so hot.
It's like, 100 degrees today, but I think I'd rather die than give up on
this challenge at this point.
Really? Yeah.
Well, that was all.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Oh. I give you guys full permission to go
full idiot mode.
There's nothing going on up there.
Don't worry about it.
Chandler must be here.
Oh, no, no, no.
I think I should go check on what they're doing.
What? Over there? Yeah.
These windows are kind of useless.
Yeah, but nothing hurts you more than emotional damage.
Wow.
Thanks for the entertainment, boys.
See you tomorrow.
I guess they're giving up.
Here they come to get their fancy cameras.
This is probably something you'll never see on the YouTube side.
And now the circle is surrounded by speakers.
The worst part is it stops every once in a while.
It goes and then it kicks right back on.
Maybe I knock them all over flat.
I can fill the speaker with water.
I never eat processed food again.
I think I might be okay.
Hot. Oh, my God.
Hot. All right, do you all see that house over there? I want you to surround
it in a circle and say nothing.
Break. Should I be scared?
What the.
All right, attention, clowns.
Nod your head if you can hear me.
Okay, I'll give you all a $1,000 each if you stay all night.
Wait. I'll give you 2000 if you don't.
There's, like, eleven of them.
Oh, there's eleven of them.
Oh, my goodness.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Well, guess what? There's still clowns out here.
Little extra security there.
You have less than 24 hours left in this circle.
So we're gonna destroy your house with a wrecking ball to make it harder.
What? Chris!
Tear down the house.
All right.
Yeah. That part of your house is gone now.
Not only did we bring a wrecking ball, but we also brought an excavator.
Take the roof off!
It's supposed to rain tomorrow.
Good
Demolition! and that's it for the destruction.
See you in 19 hours.
All right, sounds good.
I'm gonna make a half million dollars tomorrow.
Good night.
Can you guys see the timer? There it is right there.
Haven't seen them in a long time.
Emotions are hitting me pretty heavy right now.
Money's the thing we trade our life for.
Giving up a third of a year of my life for a half million? Make sure you're
trading your life for things that are worth it.
How are you feeling? I'm so ready to get out of here.
Yeah? Yeah.
Do you mind staying in this room while I set up the surprise? I'm not
leaving this room.
I'm not risking getting out.
Okay, it's gotta be minutes now.
I hear people outside.
You can just hear it.
Just that background noise of 100 people talking.
Everybody, it's time.
Give me a countdown from 10. 10 - 9 - 8 - 7-6 - 5-4 -3 - 2 - Oh my gosh.
Come on out.
Oh, my God.
It has officially been 100 days.
Step on the red line.
Are you sure? It has been 100 days.
Okay, the challenge is over! Daddy.
Are you okay? Yeah
Are you excited? Here's your check for half a million dollars.
Everyone give him a round of applause.
This has been an amazing hundred days.
I am glad it's over, though."
65fN_OUawjk,"- I got 100 of my subscribers
and gave them each $10,000.
And I also rented one of the
largest malls in the world
and locked them inside.
And for the next 10 hours,
I'm gonna hunt them down.
Run!
Get outta here!
Skedaddle!
If I find them, I take my $10,000 back.
If they survive until
morning, they keep it.
- I've never been in this mall.
- This place is massive.
- Let's go!
- Oh my God, yes!
- No, one's gonna find me here.
- No way!
Can we put this in our pockets right now?
- I know I saw someone at Lego Land,
so me and the boys are gonna check it out.
- This is ridiculous.
- Whoa, this is actually crazy.
- I know for a fact
someone is in this room.
- Isn't it funny
that there's probably
gonna be somebody here?
Let's go this way.
- Come on!
- Wait, you found someone up there?
- Yo, my parents literally told me
not to be the first person out.
- The first person has
officially been found,
and he has now transformed
into a mannequin.
One down, 99 more to go.
We need to spread out,
so I sent Chandler and Karl to Toys R Us
while I checked out the ice rink.
This mall literally has everything.
This vending machine is
suspiciously far off the wall.
Oh.
Why is this vending machine like this?
There's a ladder.
If they climbed up that
ladder into the ceiling,
they deserve to win 10 grand.
- I'm feeling there's
people at this Toys R Us.
Did you see people here?
Do you know?
- I don't know.
- Yeah, right!
Are you even hiding?
Is there anybody else in the Toys R Us?
- Yes.
- Oh, his morals are shot!
- Someone's definitely
behind these curtains.
Oh, snap!
Yo, I was not expecting the first one.
- Oh my gosh.
- There's no one else over here?
Here, hold one second.
See his face?
Yeah, there's someone else here.
Oh, I see another blue shirt.
- I can't.
- I just saved another $20,000.
I'm sorry for ruining your dreams.
- It's fine.
- It's fine.
- Oh.
No!
- Are you the only one here?
- Yes.
- Well, you just lied to me
'cause there's somebody right here.
- What a good guy.
- Oh no.
- I hate you so much, not you so much,
but I hate you so much.
- I'm a super broke college student.
This money would actually change my life.
- 10 grand would definitely mean a lot
for, not only me, but for my family.
- We've been searching for three hours,
and I've only found seven people.
So, I need some backup.
I called in Sapnap and Marques.
Guys, I need you to search this ski resort
'cause I don't have time for it.
- Hello?
Ah, found 'em.
Another one.
Oh!
- Oh God!
- There's a person there!
- There's someone?
Oh my God, how did you get in there?
I found the person.
- Oh, you made a little fort.
- That was a genuinely
good idea, but we got it.
- Nolan's checking the trashcans,
Sapnap and Marques Brownlee
are checking the ski resort.
I wonder how Karl and Chandler are doing?
- We are gonna check every
single water slide here twice.
- I don't see anybody in there.
- I didn't see anybody in there.
We're gonna check.
We're looking.
- We'll check this slide.
- Wait, guys, there's nobody up here.
- Hello?
- Yo, you called?
- Yeah, I was curious what you're up to?
- We're at the water park.
- I trust you.
Just try to find more people, okay?
- Should we check?
- They're not even allowed to be in there.
- But what if they're cheating?
- That's fair.
- No way.
No way.
Now we're allowed to go on the slide!
- Yeah!
- Getting out of Toys R Us.
Apparently they were
coming into Toys R Us.
- I see you!
What's your number?
Hey, where are you, sneaky?
You're not gonna pull a fast one on Nolan!
- While the contestant
was running from Nolan,
he actually ran straight
into Chandler and Karl.
- Look, he's running away!
- What?
He's lucky my feet are wet,
and I don't have shoes on.
I'm catching you.
- Around the corner!
- No!
- You're fast.
- With just under six hours left,
we had 78 people left to find.
- We should go find people.
There's a briefcase right there.
That means there's somebody nearby.
- Are you awake?
- She's asleep.
- Hello?
Yeah, but we found you.
Good morning.
- No, you didn't.
- What is this, Tareq?
- A panda.
- A hiding spot.
If you're in this pile of
ginormous stuffed animals,
you're gonna get found.
See that zebra blanket right there?
That's oddly stretched out
in the shape of a human.
Let's see if I just made 10 grand.
- I think I scared you.
- No, but that would've been embarrassing
if you weren't there.
- Ya boy's exhausted.
No way you're back there.
- Yo, we have a little guest.
That's crazy.
Good luck to you.
- Thank you, you too.
- Yeah, let me get a putter.
- Chandler, what are you doing?
You don't work here.
- Relax.
- What are you guys doing?
We're supposed to be looking.
- We're looking, man.
And you have to stop undermining the fact
that we're looking.
- I don't know where he is, so...
They are playing mini golf right outside.
- Howdy.
- They caught someone
right outside the box.
- Experience is what it's all about,
and I'm glad you guys
got to play putt-putt
while making me lose.
- We've caught 37 people so far,
which might sound great,
but I still have $630,000 on the line.
I think I might need some backup.
At exactly 5:00 AM I scheduled
a SWAT team to show up.
Believe it or not, there's
an entire theme park in here.
We haven't even searched it yet.
Does this not look cool?
Here's the twist I haven't told them yet.
Every person you guys find,
I'll let you keep half the money.
- Yes, sir.
- They're so serious.
What's the plan?
Do your thing.
- You two back there.
Us three, we're just gonna
circle around the whole mall.
- 7752, make sure the area's
clear before we leave it.
- Someone under the stairs by the exit.
- What?
No way.
- They are scanning this place like crazy.
- 77, check behind the
escalators to your nine.
- So, you're currently
operating a thermal drone,
and then calling it out to your people.
- Hey, we got two behind by the brown mat.
- Oh my gosh, there was a drone.
- Wait, is that someone hiding?
- Come on, let's go, let's go.
Come on, we're out.
- How long have you been under there?
- The whole time.
- The whole time?
- There's a drone flying
literally right above my head.
- All clear.
- Oh my God.
How long have you been back there?
- About five hours.
Tired.
- Not gonna get away money on our watch.
- This SWAT team does not mess around.
Oh my God, bro, look at how
many people they're finding.
He's carrying that like it weighs nothing.
You all managed to find 10 people
faster than I found like two.
As promised, you guys
can take half of 'em.
- Are you for real?
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
- Actually, here, take this one as well.
You each to get a clean
briefcase of 10 grand.
Thank you!
- Thank you.
- Appreciate it.
- SWAT team that crushed my dreams.
- And now that that's done,
this entire theme park has to be empty.
- Somehow they missed me.
I guess the drone didn't see me.
- And now they're mannequins.
The hunt continues.
Even with the SWAT team, we
have too much area to search.
We've gotta get some
contestants out in the open.
And to do it, I called upon
our friend, Jack Black.
This is gonna play over every
speaker in the entire mall.
- Jimmy's closing the water park.
You guys better find a new place to hide
if you want that money.
- Thank you, Jack Black.
- I love him so much.
- He just said that they
closed down the water park.
I have to go down all these flights
- I'm going to keep hiding
here 'til the end of the night.
- My next mission right now
is gonna be to go to pee.
I hope I survive?
- Gonna try to go under
the stage right now.
I don't think he'll be
able to catch us there.
Alrighty.
Made it under the stage, guys.
I think we'll be good here
for the rest of the night.
- I'm not kidding,
there was just somebody
there and now they're gone.
Tareq, give me your camera.
- Okay, there you go.
- There was just...
- You just saw somebody?
- Yes!
I was yelling at you to get over here.
- I don't see anyone.
I think we're good.
- It is 7:00 AM.
I knew as time went on, the
boys would get less motivated.
There are 53 people remaining.
And if you guys help me get it under 30,
I'll buy all your moms a boat.
- My mom likes boats!
- Here's how the math works out.
You get me under 30, I save 230 grand.
I can find a nice boat for 15 grand a pop.
That equals savings in my pocket.
It should be smooth sailing for the boys.
- I see what he did there.
- I believe I've sniffed out my prey.
Are you kidding?
I was positive.
There's no way nobody's
I see you!
I was almost about to leave.
- You almost kept going.
- If it means anything,
my mom's one step closer
to winning a boat.
- Your mom?
- Turns out the boats
were a good motivation
because the boys started
finding a ton of people.
- Oh no!
- We're down to just over two hours left.
The contestants have to be getting tired.
- I'm beyond delirious,
but I think I've totally outsmarted Jimmy.
- All right, Nolan, what's going on?
What are you doing, dude?
- I'm becoming an old man.
And I'm gonna go become a janitor.
Back in my day
I think I heard something
in the candy store.
I found my t-shirt.
Have you seen anybody
with a blue jumpsuit?
- I'm trying to think.
- Feel like you're lying to me, son.
- I would never.
- Jimmy said he already looked here,
but Jimmy's not good at it, so...
Oh no!
Dude, immediately.
Jimmy, you already looked here?
- Oh my gosh.
Remember, if you win your mom a boat,
you also win Sapnap's mom a boat.
- I wanna give Sapnap's mom everything.
- All right.
- Grandpa's mad.
You've been found by the old man.
What were you doing?
- I gotta go to pee.
- You were going to the bathroom?
- Yeah.
- Well, this is awkward.
- The search goes on.
- You're not lying to
me, no one's in here?
All right, I know what I need to know.
Scan the area, boys.
- Oh!
- I knew it!
- Now is there someone in here?
- No.
That's it.
- I believe him.
And if you count up the
mannequins back here,
there's over 70, which means
you guys hit your goal.
All your moms just won a brand new boat.
- You're welcome, Mom.
- Karl, I think my girlfriend
could really use a new shirt.
- I'm gonna be honest, your
girlfriend looks good in red.
- Karl, what do you think
about this shirt right here?
I don't remember what size she is.
Maybe we should buy all of 'em.
Here.
What about these Charleston Chews?
- Yeah.
And the shelf.
Maybe not the shelf.
- No, I want the shelf.
You know what?
I don't want the shelf.
You know what, Karl?
I think my girlfriend also
would want an It'Sugar box.
Let me just grab it real quick.
- Oh my God.
- Yeah, you really almost won.
- Love to hear that.
- You can do your thing.
I just need this.
With only 30 minutes left,
the mall actually opened to the public,
and I still have $230,000 left to recover.
Do you wanna be in the video?
You see any people in blue jumpsuits?
- Not yet.
- Ah, darn
- Dude, look at, I don't
care if I've looked there,
just keep looking.
Are there two people in here?
- Yes.
- If you hand them to me right now,
you get to keep one of the briefcases.
- That means you're stealing
it from somebody else.
- Don't do it!
This is going on the internet!
- There's only 15 minutes left.
- 15 minutes left, and I walk away 10K.
- Nothing can stop me.
I'm ready.
I'm winning this.
- Wait, what did I just see?
Wait.
Here, come over here.
Since there's literally
less than 20 minutes,
I'm gonna act like I can't
see, so you might wanna run.
I'd feel terrible taking
$10,000 from those guys
in the literal last 15
minutes of the challenge.
- We are in the final 10
minutes of this challenge.
- So tired.
- The home stretch is finally here.
- The challenge does end in five minutes.
- I'm not gonna do it.
- For 10 grand?
- 10 grand.
Not gonna do it.
- Wow.
- The last four minutes of this challenge,
hopefully there's no
twist and turns again.
- I'd cry real tears if I
get eliminated at this point.
- Three, two, one.
Contestants, the timer
has finally hit zero.
- It's done, it's done, it's done.
- What?
- Jimmy, called the contestants.
- I just found...
Bro, wait.
- If you are still in, that
means you won $10,000 in cash.
- You lasted one second extra.
You won.
- I know.
I'm literally listening to them.
- Oh my God!
My kids are gonna have a real vacation.
- Congratulations on all you surviving.
They each just won $10,000 in cash.
On top of all the other
money we gave away,
I had a million dollars at risk,
and I think I ended up only
spending half a million
which I can live with.
Subscribe."
jdMNoQE3mIQ,"- I just bought this private jet.
And now it's crashed.
It takes on average 31
hours for a rescue team
to find the survivors of a plane crash.
And now me and the boys
are literally stranded
in the middle of nowhere
until help arrive.
All right, let's assess
the damage over here.
- I see some water bottles.
We're gonna get thirsty out here.
You know how it is.
- Oh, look, they really paid two pilots
and they only need one?
That's why your flight's so expensive.
- Chris!
- What?
- I found snacks.
- So just like a normal
plane, it's all terrible.
We're saving these for later.
We gotta ration this.
- But I'm hungry now.
- We're gonna pool the
plane resources on the wing.
- This takes layovers to the next level.
- The only food and
water we have to survive
is what's typically
stocked on a private jet.
These tiny planes really don't
have much food and water.
I think it's time we use some strategy.
Half of us should go explore the area,
and the other half should
keep organizing the inventory
and building a shelter.
- All right, let's all
go grab plane pieces.
- The longer we explore,
the less we have to build.
- Exactly.
- We push it and we're
making like a tent area.
Uh-oh.
- It kinda works.
- I like it.
That's what we want.
- What is the objective of exploring?
- I don't think exploring does anything.
- Oh, well, when you put it that way.
Does this not look like a movie scene?
- This feels like we're
in ""Jurassic Park.""
- It really does.
- Wait, especially with that dinosaur.
- Oh, shoot.
- Wait, is this our new home?
This is epic.
They made progress while we're gone.
Doesn't look like there's much water.
- I drink my four bottles,
which is my share.
- You've been drinking waters?
- I've been thirsty.
- What happened to rationing?
- I rationed these nuts.
- Nice.
- I'm a streamer, I'm not
made for this outdoor stuff.
We've come back with so many sticks.
Oh, it's scary in here now.
Do you feel like you know
how to get back from here?
I think we're lost.
- Guys, I got a fire pit.
Holy crap.
Did you rip the engine off the plane?
This is actually a perfect fire pit.
You might not be the brightest,
but this is impressive.
- I think I have enough wood to go ahead
and get the firewood started.
Look at that.
- Chris is big braining right now, dude.
- We are thriving, not just surviving.
- I've got an idea.
Tareq, give me the drone.
Tareq brought this drone
to get cool drone shots.
But what he didn't plan for
is for me to tape the drone
and use it to scout the area.
Bro, it's literally just trees.
I wonder if Ludwig hears
this, then he's like-
- He's terrified.
- I hear a drone.
- You do?
- Is it more that way?
This way.
We might actually be lost.
Karl!
Chris!
- All right.
Still trees.
Still trees.
Wait, what is that?
Oh, my God that's water.
- Hey, Chris!
- That's water.
Look what I found.
- That's a river source.
- Wait, where is this river?
- Karl!
- Is that Ludwig yelling?
- Is that Ludwig?
- Hello?
- Okay, Karl I'm having
fun with the drone.
You go save Ludwig.
- Ludwig just screams.
- Karl!
- Where is he?
Is he in the forest?
- Where are you?
- Ludwig!
- Karl!
- Ludwig!
- Karl!
Karl! Oh my God.
- Are you kidding?
- That's like nothing.
- These are good sticks.
- That also wasn't even in the bag.
- But I...
- Watch yourself with that stick.
- We need a meeting, Jimmy.
Ludwig was lost in there
and I find him with a bag
of about eight sticks.
- Man, that's actually a lot of wood.
- It's a good amount of sticks.
- He was out there for an hour.
.
- Here's the situation.
This plane wing can fall at any point,
we barely have any water left,
and we haven't even built that helipad
for the helicopter to land and pick us up
when the time's up yet.
I know everyone's about to go to bed,
but I just remember we have a flare gun.
- Help!
- Oh.
- Oh, wow.
Wait, is it gonna come down?
Oh, we're dead.
Oh wait, nevermind. Another one!
Ooh.
Before you shoot our last flare,
what if we actually need a flare?
- Why would we possibly need a flare?
- Apparently this drone
has a thermal camera.
So we decided to test something
in the name of science.
- Dude let me write a message in urine.
- All right, we're ready?
Write us a message in your pee.
- I think I see it.
- Yes, we see his pee!
- You see it? I put my initials.
- Yeah, we do.
- We can see your pee.
- Oh my God.
- I wanted to write, ""sub to MrBeast""
but I realized I was
gonna run out of fuel.
- You don't have enough, yeah.
- Yeah.
Oh, that's actually the first water bottle
I've had in six hours.
- Chris, are you hungry?
- What do you think, Tareq?
What kind of question is
that? Of course I'm hungry.
Not anybody has ate.
- We're not even halfway
through the challenge
and we're starting to go
crazy due to dehydration.
- The only thing in the air right now
are these bugs.
- Guys, I just realized
we're gonna miss our connecting flight.
- Guys, I just realized
we're probably gonna miss
our connecting flight.
- I'm not having fun anymore, bro.
- This is taking lay over
to a whole new extreme.
- It's 4:00 AM, I've gotten no sleep.
It's freezing cold outside.
I've gone from heat
exhaustion to shivering
in like six hours.
- How'd everyone sleep last night?
- On the wrong side of the plane.
- It got really cold
in the cave over there,
so we all came over here
and slept by the fire.
- How much food do we have left?
- None.
- We have like 10 packs of nuts.
- Is that the only thing?
- Literally only peanuts.
- As you guys remember when
I was playing with the drone,
we saw a river over there.
And see now we need to shower
and none of us have water
minus like, Ludwig.
- I drink my four bottles.
- I think we should go find the river.
- To the river.
♪ Going to find a river
through the woods ♪
You guys gotta remember
I grew up in woods.
The roots have been washed out by water,
that means we're getting close.
Guys, I think I hear it.
- Yeah.
Chris, the river did
look closer on the drone.
- We're almost there.
- You guys wanna hear my Chris impression?
""Yo, it's right through here, guys.""
- I am actually seeing
like little purple dots
and I don't know if it's
gnats or I'm dehydrated.
- I wouldn't drink out of this river
- Boy, fishing poles.
- Oh.
- We did not put those
there, just to be clear.
I don't think this is
ever gonna be clean enough
to drink and bathe in.
- No.
- I have a headache and dehydrated.
Chris is just gonna keep going.
- We keep trekking off.
- I think we just head back to the plane
and just leave them.
- Shower would have been nice, though.
- Oh, what?
Why in America's there just
random things in the woods?
- Whoa.
- How old is this Mountain Dew?
- Whoa.
- Oh my God.
This thing's disgusting.
Oh, there's wasps in here.
- Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
- All right, let's jet, let's jet.
- I got you.
- Oh, we brought bug spray.
- Run!
- I've never been so excited
to get back to a crash site.
- We're back!
- Do you hear yelling?
- I hear yelling.
- What are you a river God?
- I am a river God.
That's why I have this staff.
It gives me plus 18 intellect.
You guys been being productive?
- Chris, you're back.
- Chris, who's that? I'm the river God.
- I'm severely dehydrated.
They need to pack more waters on plane
for when you get in a plane crash.
This is really hard to survive
off of like this much water.
How does this compare
to 24 hours in a desert?
- During the day was
hot, but we had water.
- How does this compare to
50 hours in the wilderness?
- This is way harder.
- Because in the wilderness
one, we had water.
- Almost like you need water to survive.
- Is there actually a
helicopter coming or not?
I don't actually trust that
there's a helicopter coming.
- It's officially been 30 hours,
which means we have one more hour
until the helicopter saves us.
I have three layers of sunscreen on,
four layers of bug spray.
But that aside, we should build a place
for the helicopter to land.
- Go a little faster,
we've only got an hour.
- You wanna do it?
- Why do I have to mow the grass?
- We could burn the grass,
'cause then it'll just be a bare path.
Now, theoretically,
we should be able to burn the grass
inside of where we did
the fire extinguisher.
- This is a terrible idea.
- So how are you making the H, Chris?
- I'm using fire.
- Fire!
I took care of it.
- I think now we're
burning an obvious place
for them to land.
- Bro, we ran out of water 10 hours ago.
- I'm just excited to go
home and take a shower.
- What? Come on, you had fun. Did you not?
- It was a good time.
- What?
- Exactly.
- With the exception of the lack of food,
the lack of water, the lack
of shower, the lack of sleep.
- I'm tired.
- It hurts to breathe.
- I haven't had a drink in five hours.
- Chris, are you hungry?
- What do you think, Tareq?
- Oh wait, do you guys hear...
- I hear it.
- Oh my God.
- I hear it. Oh my God.
- We gotta let him know where we are.
Oh.
- Hey! That's our rescue helicopter.
That means that 31 hours is officially up.
Here.
- Here.
- Right there.
- On the H that I made.
- Yes! Look at the trees!
- Oh my God!
- Whoo!
31 hours in that stupid plane.
I'm out here. Goodbye.
I'm gonna go get some
water and take a shower.
- We're Going Home! We're Going Home!
- That just took layovers
to the next level.
- To the next level.
♪ MrBeast, oh ♪
- I'll tell you this. I'll
tell you this right now.
This is about to take
layover to the next level.
- I swear to go God..."
2isYuQZMbdU,"- We just hit 100 million subscribers,
and from the bottom of my heart,
thank you everyone that subscribed.
And to celebrate I bought
this ginormous private island,
and I'm giving it to one
of you in this video!
So, I brought 100 of my
subscribers to compete
in four extreme challenges.
Last one standing wins this island.
The first challenge is simple.
First 50 people to start a fire
and light their torch move on!
Begin!
- See the smoke on that?
How is it not lighting?
- This isn't easy, guys.
He's not giving it away.
- Do none of you want an island?
- I'm trying!
- Then start a fire faster!
- According to our estimate,
it's gonna take them on average 20 minutes
to start the fire.
(contestant yells)
Really?
Oh wow!
By 20 minutes I meant one minute.
- Thank you, fire god!
- [MrBeast] Continue to the raft!
- Here we go, baby.
I'm not going home today.
- Yes!
Yes!
- The color green, that's
gonna be the color of money.
- Nothing's lighting up.
Oh my God!
- Did he get it?
- God bless America!
God bless America!
- See that ship right there, Tariq?
- [Tariq] Yeah.
- [MrBeast] That's challenge number two
and a literal recreation of Squid Game.
See that pirate ship over there?
- [Tariq] Yes.
- [MrBeast] That's challenge number three,
and we're literally throwing
people off the ship.
Trust me, you wanna watch this video.
This is the easiest of all the challenges.
- Yeah!
- Only 10 spots remain!
- Come on, come on!
(contestant yells)
- I freakin' did it!
- Three spots left!
- My flint is worn down.
I'm not giving up.
Let's go!
- Come on!
Come on!
- This is my one and only chance.
There's only two spots left.
- Come on.
Come on!
Let's go!
- Oh my God!
Is it lit?
Is it lit?
- [MrBeast] One spot left!
(contestants yell)
The competition is over!
We have our 50 contestants!
(contestants cheer)
In just one challenge, 50
people lost their chance
to win this beautiful private island.
And now it's time for
challenge number two,
red light, green light
because Squid Game's
our most viewed video,
so why not bring it back?
And unlike last time, we're
in the middle of the ocean.
Seriously, the middle of the ocean.
Bring in the 50 remaining contestants.
Come on in, come on in.
- I'm so freakin' nervous right now.
- Since you all are subscribers,
I assume you saw the
first Squid Game video.
- Yeah!
- [MrBeast] Okay, well, this
one's a little different.
Only the first 20 to step on the red line
or cross it move on, okay?
- Okay!
- The red line, that's
all we're thinking about.
20 people.
- There is no time limit.
Green light.
Red light.
- [Nolan] He just completely moved.
- We have our first official elimination.
Green light.
Red light.
Chris, I'll give you the chance to do one.
- Green eggs and ham.
I'm sorry, guys.
I had to be a little ruthless.
- The beauty of this red
light, green light is
there's no time limit.
I can just put the mic
down and wait 10 minutes.
- [Nolan] You're looking a little shaky.
Are you scared?
- I gotta win an island.
- I can't feel my feet at all,
but I'm just just imagining
myself on an island.
(harp music)
- We're gonna be here a while.
Does anybody need a snack?
- Wait, wait.
You're definitely eliminated.
- [Tariq] You did say ""red
light, green light"" at the end.
- Red light.
Red light.
Let me review the footage
and see if he's correct.
- When you were explaining
the rules you said-
- Red light, green light
is there's no time limit.
Yeah, we have our first
finisher by technicality.
- I was worried I threw it all away,
but I thought I heard it.
- It was green light.
I'm surprised more of you didn't catch on.
Red light.
Every word that leaves this
mouth I gotta think it through.
Green light.
Red light.
Ooh!
- That was the most
nervewracking thing of my life.
- [MrBeast] Green light.
Red light.
Oh.
Oh, are you okay?
I'd give it to him if it was close,
but it was quite a ways away.
I love you though.
Good effort.
15 spots remain for a chance to compete
for a private island.
Green light.
Red light.
Well, you're good, you're good.
There are two slots remaining.
She's obviously gonna cross
look how close she is.
Please, no one hurt yourself.
Green light.
Oh, he got it first.
He got it first.
- Yeah, baby!
- Oh my God.
- Yes!
- I was this close.
- As a thank you for coming out,
we're gonna give all of you $3,000.
I appreciate it.
Everybody, do you see
that raft down there?
- [Contestants] Yeah!
- There's only 10 seats in
it, and there are 20 of you.
I need to know who the
earliest subscriber here is.
Since this is our 100
million subscriber special,
we wanted to give our earliest subscriber
a competitive edge, so we told her this.
I need you to eliminate half the people,
whoever you want to go.
Just pick half of them.
- No, you're joking.
- [MrBeast] But it
didn't take long for her
to just start picking people.
All right, one down.
- Have fun, guys!
- I'll miss you, man!
- I'm gonna go with 39.7.
- Take it easy!
- I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.
- I know this must be hard on you.
Do you wanna just have someone else pick?
- No, I don't wanna go.
Okay.
- Oh my God, dude.
- Wow.
- I love you all!
It's been a great ride!
- Oh!
- [Gabbie] I'm so sorry.
- Ah, this is brutal.
- [Gabbie] I'm so sorry.
- I'll take it.
- No way.
- This is terrible.
- Oh my God.
- Three from the middle.
- No!
- Come on!
- I'm so sorry.
- Hey, it was not your fault.
- [Contestant] Bro,
right there to my dream.
- If any of you win,
you owe this to Gabbie
'cause she could've eliminated you.
- That's the final 10.
(contestants cheer)
- That was like a bullet
every time she said someone.
- My heart.
- And now that we have 10 people,
that's the exact amount
that could fit in our raft.
Follow me.
We're gonna tug 'em over to
that pirate ship right there
and eliminate some more.
Welcome.
Have you ever been on
a pirate ship before?
- Not once in my life.
(dramatic music)
- It's been a long journey to get here.
You had to fight from 100 down to 10.
I don't even know if you
guys notice, but back there,
that's the island you
guys are competing for.
(contestants cheer)
- And half of you aren't
even gonna step foot on it.
- [Contestant] Yeah, we hate you, Nolan.
- I am so excited to be out here competing
for a private island.
- I'm already planning out the structure.
Mansion's gonna go there.
- As soon as I win the island,
I'm gonna sell it for as
much cash as I can get.
- Now let's eliminate half of you.
(contestants groan)
For our next challenge, we
have 10 planks behind me.
And attached to each plank is a rope.
When we cut the rope,
five of them will drop you
and five of them won't.
(contestants groan)
- That's gonna be wild.
- Who wants to go first?
- I'll do it!
- Come on up, sir.
You can pick any of these 10 planks.
Just stand on the end of one of those.
- This is not a good plank.
- All right, right there.
Are you sure about this plank?
Everyone, salute him!
- It's been real, y'all.
- Chris, cut the rope!
- Oh!
- All right!
He passed.
Congrats!
Don't fall off the boat!
Now all your odds are actually worse.
And while she's deciding her plank,
I wanna tell you guys about Shopify.
Shopify is an easy to use platform
that makes starting a business
as easy as using your phone.
Can you say, ""I love Shopify?""
- I love Shopify.
I love Shopify, I love Shopify.
- Oh my gosh, it worked!
We have two of the five finishers.
Oh, now your odds are even worse!
- No.
- Pick any of the eight remaining planks.
- I'm so nervous for you, bro.
- Oh, Lordy.
- I've personally been
using Shopify to sell merch
since we had three million subscribers,
which is crazy 'cause
we're on 100 million now.
We also use it to sell our
chocolate bars and so much more.
I don't know why,
but I have a feeling
this is gonna drop him.
- Three, two, one.
- Let's go!
- He's safe?
Three people have already made it.
This is extreme luck.
- Only two spots remain.
What don't you like about this plank?
- It looks funny.
- That plank looks funny?
Don't pick it then.
All right.
Before we cut the rope,
I just wanna let you know
that Shopify believes
in creators like us and wants
to help us turn our ideas
into businesses.
Isn't that great?
- Yeah.
- Chandler, cut the rope.
(dramatic music)
No way.
(contestants yell)
There's only five working planks
and somehow they picked four of them.
- There's only one safe plank left.
- Oh my God.
I was so ready to go swimming.
- Since these four people
somehow guessed correctly
even though it's super
statistically improbable,
we just had everyone else line up,
and we're gonna start on the end.
- I have the carrot of protection.
- All right, let's see if the
carrot of protection works.
Cut it.
- Oh geez.
- Go quicker!
- Oh!
Oh my God.
- Oh!
- One down!
- He fell!
- At least now I know the
planks really do work,
and they're just lucky.
- Remember me.
- Okay, so do you use
Shopify to sell anything?
- No.
- Then the gods probably won't bless you.
Let's see it.
(contestant yells)
That's what happens when
you don't use Shopify.
- I'll miss him.
- Bye.
I didn't mean to clap.
That was rude.
- Do any of you winners
wanna cut this next rope?
Do you wanna cut it?
Come over here.
Yeah, don't fall.
Cut the rope when you want.
- I'm praying for you, my boy.
- Oh snap!
Wow.
- I feel crazy right now.
I've never been in open water before,
and I think you put bad
juju on me earlier, Jimmy.
- Oh snap.
You guys wanna know one of the
great things about Shopify?
- What?
- What?
- You can sell online, in
person, and through social media.
Good luck.
Go ahead and cut the rope.
She should be fine.
- You were wrong.
- Oh, they just fell!
- We love you, Gabbie.
- Oh my God!
- And now two remain.
- You guys gotta be feeling great.
- No.
- [Chris] 50/50 great.
- I am so scared.
- One is dropping.
One is moving on.
There's never been a better
time to make a Shopify store.
Just go to shopify.com/mrbeast.
And I'm gonna pick 100
random people that do
and literally be your first
customer on your store.
I'm gonna go on there and order
an item from your website.
- I'm shaking.
- And for the last two, I think
we cut 'em at the same time.
- It all comes down to this.
- Gonna see who goes in the water
and who goes to the island.
Let's go!
(everyone yells)
- [MrBeast] And that is our final victor!
- 100 people.
We're the five left.
- Hey, sorry you didn't win an island!
Thanks for coming out!
- Love you, Gabbie!
- Captain, set sail for the island.
Welcome to the island.
Look how beautiful this beach is.
- This is it.
- And one of you is winning it.
The other four, I don't know.
And the island comes with
complimentary golf carts.
Everyone hop on board.
This island has a cabana,
a helicopter pad, a beautiful pool.
It is nice.
- Maybe I won't sell the island anymore.
- I mean, yeah, it's pretty beautiful.
- This island is amazing.
- This is absolutely unreal
Life changing.
- And now we have one final challenge
to decide which one of
you wins the island.
- Let's go!
- But before we do that
challenge, I have a proposition.
I'm gonna hand each of
you a check for $50,000.
Here you go.
Here's 50 grand.
Which one of you subscribed the latest?
All right, come over here.
Do you wanna burn this $50,000
and compete for the island
or keep 50 grand and leave?
- Keep it, keep it.
- It's a lot.
I'm a competitor.
I'm not using that.
- Oh my God.
All right!
This man's-
- Going for the island, baby!
- [MrBeast] He just lit 50 grand on fire.
- That could be the biggest
mistake of his life.
- You want 50 grand in cash
or to compete for an island?
- I'll compete for the island.
- Really?
Oh my gosh.
First two people said no to the money.
How about you?
50 grand's a lot.
- $50,000 couldn't even pay
for a year's worth of tuition.
- Oh my gosh.
That's sad.
- I'll take my chances.
- She wants an island!
- Oh my gosh.
Wow!
If you stay in, you only
have a 25% chance of winning.
- This is the hardest decision
I've ever had to make, but-
- Are you gonna say no to $50,000?
- We're going for the island, baby.
- [Chris] Oh my goodness.
No!
- Wow.
That's crazy.
I just saved $200,000.
Am I gonna save another 50?
- Earlier today I was
like this close to losing.
I stayed in and everything
else has been luck so far
and I've had great luck.
I wanna keep trying.
- No way, no way.
Oh my God.
Only one of you is winning this island.
Oh my God.
And for the final challenge,
we have our 100 million
subscriber play button.
Taped to the back of it
is the deed to the island.
I'm gonna go hide this,
and whoever finds it
first wins the island.
All right, blindfold them.
- Blindfold!
Blindfold!
Blindfold!
- All right, we're blindfolded.
- I'm going to hide the play button.
Keep 'em distracted, Chris.
I'm gonna drive really far away,
so they think we hid it far away,
but then I'm gonna come back
and hide it in front of them.
- That's exactly what I was thinking.
- I have to get into the
mind of Jimmy right now.
- I know exactly where
Jimmy's gonna hide it.
He's gonna hide it in
the spot that I find it.
- What?
- That's exactly where it's gonna be.
(Nolan laughs)
- [Chandler] We should
just throw it in the ocean.
- You know this is our 100
million subscriber play button?
- We only get one?
- We're not throwing it in the ocean!
- From airports to pirate ships to barges,
it's been an experience
I will never forget,
that's for sure.
- Part of me wishes I took the 50,000,
but I just had the gut
feeling just to keep going
and just keep pushing for it.
- I'm gonna park the golf
cart here, so they don't hear.
If you look over there,
you'll see the contestants.
They won't expect us
to hide it this close.
I say we hide it in these trees.
- This should be good.
- After I lost an island, I
had nightmares for over a year.
This will haunt you for
the rest of your life.
- You may now remove your blindfolds!
You know the deal.
First one to find the play
button wins the island.
Good luck.
- [Chris] Go!
- [Contestant] I have a
feeling it might be over here.
- Get outta here, go your own way!
- An island's on the line!
- I don't regret throwing
50 grand in a fire
'cause I'm gonna find this case.
- Think in the mind of Jimmy.
Where would Jimmy hide?
- Oh, he's really fast.
It's like he's competing for an island.
(dramatic music)
- I don't know where to go.
- All I see is like a bunch of rocks.
- Me and Chandler are wearing
our brand new limited edition
100 million subscriber merch.
- Yes, we are.
- This is our first
and maybe only merch
drop of the entire year.
We filmed a MrBeast video
that will never be uploaded
to the public.
Just buy either item
and we will email you a
link to watch the video.
You have seven days.
Let's go see who wins the island.
- Look for things in areas
where they shouldn't be.
- Actually a really good
place to hide a button.
- [MrBeast] There are now
three contestants at the pool.
- I wanna jump in.
- Let's go.
- I don't see anything red.
- We have someone checking the treehouse
and someone wandering through the woods.
None of them are close.
- It's not in here.
- I am so winded right now.
I want this play button.
- I don't even know if I remember
what the freaking box looks like.
- To the left, you'll see
where I buried the play button.
Notice how there's no one around it.
Great success.
But then a few minutes
later, this happened.
(dramatic music)
- Watch out, man.
- [MrBeast] And then it happened again.
And again
- He just walked right past it!
- You hid it really good.
I gotta give it to you.
- Do you believe me now when
I say this island's massive?
- Yes, there can be so many possibilities.
- It's literally four times bigger
than the private island Chandler won.
- You're right.
- [MrBeast] The sun is setting,
and I have no idea how they're
gonna find the play button
after dark.
- I wouldn't put it past
Jimmy to put it right behind
where we were at.
- Looking for new sand, anything fresh.
- I'm gonna find that play button.
Wait!
Okay, no.
- Kinda wanna check over here.
- I can't, I can't give up.
- I'm freaking out.
Tariq, I'm freaking out.
Oh, she's moving the sticks.
If she doesn't find this-
- I got it!
- [Contestant] What?
- You're joking.
- I got it!
- Oh my God.
- You're joking.
- I got it!
- That's upsetting.
- She won a great island.
- Congratulations.
- I feel like this doesn't even feel real.
I think this is the craziest
video you've ever done
and the fact that I won it,
like it doesn't feel real.
- I'm so happy for you.
Congratulations.
- I'm so happy, thank you.
- No problem.
- We all burned 50K in
front of each other.
- Like idiots.
- Boys!
It's now time we open
our 100 million subscriber play button.
This is fresh from YouTube.
How do I open it?
- It's actually fresh from the ground.
- I hate him.
- This is over a decade of my
life represented in one item.
This is our 100 million-
- That's a piece of paper.
- Oh my goodness!
From the bottom of my heart,
thank you everyone who subscribed.
This channel means the world to me,
and I genuinely appreciate anyone
who's ever watched the videos.
- Thank you guys for always
supporting us and watching us.
- Over the past couple years,
I've had some of the most
insane experience of my life.
- You guys took me from
janitor to being...
(crickets chirp)
- We love you!
- Inside of here is
the deed to the island.
Congratulations.
- Thank you.
I won an island!
- Congratulations!
(MrBeast yells)
- [MrBeast] Don't forget
to buy our exclusive 100
million subscriber merch.
Every single one of you that
buys this will get emailed
a never before seen MrBeast video.
We spent over half a million
dollars on this video
and I promise you'll love it.
Just go to shopmrbeast.com
and buy the 100 mil
subscriber merch right now."
tVWWp1PqDus,"- [Mr Beast] I built two massive circles
and put 100 boys in one
and 100 girls in the other
and whichever circle has more people
after 100 hours wins $500,000
but if you touch the red
line, you are eliminated.
- [Boy] We got that!
- It's on!
- We got that.
- I'm not leaving.
- I'm not leaving, either,
Woo!
- Woo!
- It is a team competition,
boys versus girls.
The challenge is officially beginning.
Whichever circle has the
most people in 100 hours
splits the half a million dollars
amongst their entire team.
- Even if we leave, if our
team wins, we get five grand.
- [Boy] That's sick!
- [Boys Chant] Boys rule, girls drool!
Boys rule, girls drool!
- [All Girls] Boys, you suck!
Boys, you suck!
(teams continue chanting over each other)
- Do any of you wanna leave?
- [Boys] No!
- Nobody?
Oh my gosh, two people
just stepped... wait, what?
(group groans)
Don't lie to us, why'd you get out?
- So I told my girlfriend
I'd go out with her tonight.
- Can we get a simp chant?
- [Boys] Simp, simp, simp, simp!
- How are you gonna keep
all 100 girls in here?
- I got a lot of (growls) in
me so we're definitely gonna-
- Brute force it.
- Yeah!
- Woo!
- Are we really gonna stand
here and lose to the girls?
- [Group] No!
- You think if I left during
this, anyone would notice?
- No, probably not.
Wait, oh my God.
- No, you are one of us!
- Take two steps back
so they can't reach you.
Hey, what?
What is going on?
- [Boy] What are you doing?
- I can't lose my job
over $5K, I just got it,
I just graduated.
- Oh really?
Hopefully you win five
grand, not looking likely.
It's been 20 minutes and 5 boys
have dropped and zero girls.
It is not looking good for the boys
and in case you're wondering,
""How will we know if someone
steps on the red line?""
Well, we have over 65 different cameras
covering every square-inch
of those two rooms,
and a team of people monitoring
everyone's every move.
We will know if they're out.
I have a present for you.
He has no idea how to drive
this thing, everyone back up.
- Oh my God, this is not like the Wii.
- Watch out, he's not forklift certified!
- Woo!
- You all now have a way to poop.
All right, goodbye.
- Bye!
- And now he's drifting the forklift.
- Now the boys have a place to poop
and the girls have a
place to poop, good luck.
(dramatic music begins)
(clock ticks)
- My cat is alone in my apartment.
- Food, water?
- She has food for like
three days, but that's it.
- I did not take off work tomorrow
and I'm going to Chicago on Friday,
I have a flight at 3:00 PM.
- [Mr Beast] So many people
had jobs and family members
expecting them later that
night or the next day,
which is exactly what I wanted to happen
and why I didn't tell 'em anything
about the challenge before we started.
You said you're leaving
'cause you have a baby?
- I have a baby.
(girls cheer)
- Someone had to leave
'cause they have a baby.
It's okay, it's okay.
- We both have to leave tomorrow anyway.
- Yeah, I'd like to still
have a job after this, so...
- One of the GoPros on the red lines
caught something interesting.
Gather around, gather around, my children.
One of you got super close to the line
and you need to decide
if they're out, okay?
- [Group] Ooh.
- [Mr Beast] Is that out or in?
- He's in!
- Let me play it a couple more seconds.
(group of boys groans)
He stepped on the line anyways, he's out.
A bunch of girls are leaving
because they're gambling
on their team winning without their help.
The girls were destroying the boys
and now the boys are in the lead.
- Literally, another four just left.
- $5,000 would change a lot
of peoples' lives right now!
- It would change mine!
- We're girls, we can do hard things.
- Clearly we're not.
Honey, we left.
(sad music begins)
(girls laugh)
- 20 girls are out.
- It sounds like a lot
of girls are getting out,
so that's good news, 'cause we don't have
a clue how many are left.
(upbeat music begins)
- [Mr Beast] And now that
we're getting deep into
the challenge, we brought
them all oatmeal for dinner.
You know, we gotta see who wants it more.
- We're eating this oatmeal on this big
pile of money right here.
The oatmeal is not good though.
- This oatmeal is psychological torture.
- [Mr Beast] The boys lost
16 people to the oatmeal.
The girls, on the other
hand, only lost four.
- Did you guys enjoy your food?
- [Girls] No!
- And I don't like raisins.
- [Mr Beast] And how many raisins
did you have in your bowl?
- About 20.
- It is almost dead even, this is crazy.
- We are all so close to each other.
I look to my left, person.
Look to my right, toes.
- [Mr Beast] Throughout the first night,
seven boys and nine girls left.
The boys must have gotten
better sleep than the girls.
- Our goal today is just to be louder
and better than the boys.
- [Girls] Three, two, one...
(girls scream)
(boy scream louder)
- Morning.
These are the troopers that
survived the first night.
Do you wanna know how many boys are left?
- [Girls] Yeah!
- I'll go count 'em, I'll be right back.
I'm not coming back.
62 of you survived the
night, look at you guys.
Do you guys wanna know
how many girls are left?
- [Boys] Yes.
- Okay, I'm gonna go
count 'em, I'll be right back.
I'm not coming back.
(upbeat music begins)
I don't know why, but
the boys were actually
excited for their oatmeal.
- [Boys] Oatmeal, oatmeal, oatmeal!
- [Mr Beast] The girls, on
the other hand, were not.
- Oatmeal, yay.
- You're gonna tell me that's good?
- [Mr Beast] The contestants
were getting pretty bored
at this point, so the girls started
creating stuff with the money.
They made a money jump
rope, money hopscotch.
They even made these little money dolls
and the boys, well...
(boys cheer)
- What is going on?
- Mr. Beast, forgive us for our sins.
- [Mr Beast] People were getting
out in all sorts of ways.
Some people got out on accident,
some couldn't handle the pressure,
and this girl got out to literally
save another contestant's cat.
- My cat will die.
(cat meows)
- I feel very accomplished.
(upbeat music begins)
- Do you know how long
you've been in here?
- [Girls] 24 hours!
- Exactly, and as a reward... (claps)
All right, take your blindfolds off.
(girls scream)
We brought in Hibachi chefs
to cook their dinner in front of them.
- It's showtime!
(girls cheer)
(upbeat music continues)
- 24 hours on oatmeal and this is perfect.
- You know what I just realized?
- What?
- We have to feed the boys.
- For the past two hours,
we've been hearing the girls having fun.
I'm literally going crazy in here.
- Are you ready for the surprise?
- [Boys] Yeah!
- Let's do it again. (claps)
The surprise is now here.
(boys cheer)
- I'm feeling good now.
- I think I'm feeling good.
- Eat your protein.
(boys cheer)
(glass shatters)
- Attention!
- [Boy] No!
- Can you confirm that's you?
(boys groan)
(boys applaud)
- [Mr Beast] Since not
much happened on day two,
I let Karl and Nolan annoy the contestants
while they were asleep.
- We're gonna give the boys and girls
a present from each other.
Let's do this.
- This is a present from the boys.
(loud siren begins)
Let's get out of here!
- Is that a siren?
- That's really annoying, even out here.
(siren continues)
- We should go now.
(girls cheer)
- They smacked it!
- I can't take this much longer, man.
- This is the worst day of my life.
- The girls already turned theirs off.
(siren stops)
(boys cheer)
(funky music begins)
(clock ticks)
- Morning of day three, it's
starting to stink in here,
'cause no one has showers.
We're still pulling through.
- We have a loss of
insanity, as you can see
by this Muscle Milk here, our
insanity is entirely gone.
- [Mr Beast] Last night,
this guy told Nolan
that he has an important
Zoom call for a scholarship.
So Nolan got him a suit and a laptop
so he could attend the call
from inside the circle.
This seems like a bad idea.
- Start us off by just telling us
a little bit about yourself.
- I'm an Elementary Ed Major.
- Everyone get in the camera, and just...
- I'm in a Mr Beast video right now,
they're all behind me doing something.
- Very committed.
- What life lessons have you learned?
- Party all day, party all night!
- Kevin, you are keeping
your composure so well
and I'm really proud of you.
- I think he's gonna get the scholarship.
- Bye y'all, thank you.
(boys cheer)
- Kevin, Kevin!
- I wonder what the guys
are at, I'm guessing 35.
What are y'all guessing?
- 20.
- I'm gonna start getting real rowdy.
(screams)
(girls laugh)
I might start losing...
actually losing my mind.
- It's been 43 hours
and they deserve a prize
for putting their body on
the line for their team,
which is why I custom
wrapped this blue Nissan,
hide it in that porta
potty and I custom wrapped
this pink Nissan that
I'm gonna hide in here.
I'm gonna take the key and
I'm gonna hide it right here
and whoever finds the keys
in these porta potties
first keeps the car.
(car horn beeps)
But once we got the porta potties placed,
we sat and watched while
people went in and out
without finding the keys.
- Oh my gosh, she's walking out.
- Oh, no keys.
Oh, the second person went in.
- Literally, any of them could
walk in there and win a car.
- Oh, here she comes.
Nothing.
- [Mr Beast] It was taking
forever for anyone to find
the keys, so Karl checked
the boys' porta potties,
and the key was actually gone.
- Who has it?
- I do.
- Oh, he does have it, yes!
(car horn beeps)
- Oh, my God.
(boys applauding)
I won't forget y'all, man.
- And get him five grand to
pay for the gas for his car.
(horn beeps repeatedly)
(boys cheer)
Then the boys were
convinced that the car key
wasn't the only hidden
prize inside their circle.
So they started looking.
- [Boy] And we just broke the glass,
in hopes of finding
something at the bottom.
- How does it feel to be the most
destructive person in here?
- Pretty fun.
(funky music continues)
- Everyone in both circles has
officially survived 50 hours.
(girls cheer)
Yes, you're halfway
done with the challenge
and to celebrate, bring
in the Rubik's cubes.
In front of the girls
is 100 Rubik's cubes,
and in front of the boys
is 100 Rubik's cubes.
It's a race to see which team
can solve all the Rubik's cubes first.
Well, whichever team loses,
gets their circle cut in half.
(girls gasp)
- I don't even know how to do this.
- Solve the white side and
then he can solve the rest.
- [Mr Beast] We didn't
realize until this competition
started that only one boy...
Oh, they're literally handing it to him...
and only one girl actually knew
how to solve a Rubik's cube.
Out of all these guys, he's the only one
that learned how to solve a
Rubik's cube and he stayed.
- Oh, I'm not leaving.
- And while the teams are
solving these Rubik's cubes,
I wanna tell you about Current.
- The first one's done!
- Only 99 more to go!
- Current is the mobile banking app
that's changing how money works.
Old banks hit you with all kinds of fees,
but Current has no monthly fees
and is all about saving you money
and what makes Current different
than normal mobile banking
is they give you 4%
interest on your savings.
Does your savings account
give you 4% interest?
- Yes, 'cause I use Current.
- Oh wait, you actually do.
He actually does.
(Karl laughs)
Six have been solved.
Eight Rubik's cubes
have been solved so far.
- I'm trying my best.
- The white side needs to
look like this on the outside.
- 25 done.
- And if you do your direct
deposits through Current,
you can get your money
two days in advance.
Since the boys were getting
way ahead of the girls,
I decided to make things interesting.
We're gonna offer the one guy in there
that knows how to solve them
$10,000 to leave right now.
I love how he's still solving.
We got $10,000 right here,
you can just walk out the circle.
- [Boy] Do it, do it.
- I'm out.
- It's 10 grand.
I would leave.
(boys groan)
- $10K is $10K!
- The boys were blowing
you out of the water.
I paid the one guy who knew
how to solve them to leave.
Now, if you don't win,
that was all for nothing.
So win for me.
- You're almost halfway done,
the girls are still losing.
- [Mr Beast] Current is
helping me give away $25,000.
100 of you will win
$250, just click the link
and use the code Beast250 to enter.
Even if you don't win the $250,
I'm gonna be personally giving you a gift
to every single one of
you that install Current
and use this code right
here when you sign up.
So if you haven't already,
click on the description
and download Current right now.
- Give me another one, I
got it, I can do that again.
- Go faster Zeke, you're making me mad.
- This is the last Rubik's cube.
Bro, he's shaking.
I really hope the girls
just miraculously catch up.
(intense music begins)
Oh my god!
(boys cheer)
Chris, you might wanna move.
- Oh, yeah.
- All right.
The girls' circle is cut in half,
because they lost the Rubik's
cube challenge to the boys
and the only girl that knew how to solve
a Rubik's cube ended up leaving.
Hopefully all of her
effort wasn't for nothing.
- I did 96 Rubik's cubes but I still lost.
- [Mr Beast] With the
third night rolling in,
I wanted to find out which
team would get tempted easier.
- This is an empty briefcase.
I'm gonna put it outside the circle.
Let's see if we can get somebody out.
- [Boy] What do you
want, what do you want?
- All right, let's go.
- [Boy Participant] No!
- I did it, yay!
(boys laugh)
- The briefcase was empty. (laughs)
- [Mr Beast] Then Nolan
put another briefcase out.
- [Boy] Oh!
- Please take your briefcase.
- [Mr Beast] And tricked the boys again.
- And I got cereal.
- It is not nothing.
- [Mr Beast] And again
and again when one boy got out trying
to grab it without leaving the circle.
- [Boy] Go for it.
(boys groan)
- At least you got what
was in that briefcase.
(boys groan)
- [Mr Beast] So, of course they tried
the same trick on the girls.
- [Girl] If there's no money,
you're gonna look like an idiot.
- Yeah, I am.
- It's an empty briefcase.
- All right.
The girls are clearly
smarter than the guys.
- It's 1:00 AM, we're
all losing our minds.
- They cut our circle in half
(girls giggle manically)
and we're losing it.
- [Mr Beast] I can't
believe it's so close.
After three days, both
teams still have a shot
of winning the half a million dollars.
It's officially hour 70.
How many girls do you
think are still left?
- [Boy] 20.
- [Boy] 25.
- 20, so you don't even think
they're in the 30s anymore.
On day four, one of the girls said
she had a surprise for me.
- I found some car keys in the porta potty
and we don't wanna tell the other girls
'cause we don't want them to freak out.
- Okay, give me one second.
Here is your brand new car!
(girls scream and cheer)
Hey, if Chris scratches
it, it's coming with it.
You don't have to get
out, but whenever you do,
your brand new car's right there.
- I'm definitely staying in.
- Okay, go for it.
That's dedication.
I have a podium with a giant red button,
I'm gonna put it in there and say nothing.
Let's see if anyone presses it.
(dramatic music continues)
- What does the button do?
- Cuts their circle in half.
- This is so suspicious.
- We're playing it cautious,
but we're playing it smart.
(boys protest)
- He didn't even explain what it was
and that boy instantly pressed it.
- All right, gentlemen, do
you know what this does?
- [Boys] No.
- It cuts your circle in half.
- No!
(boys groan)
- All right, well I'm
gonna go grab spray paint.
Any of you press this?
- [Girls] No.
- Okay, good.
- [Girls] Boys suck, boys suck!
- How we feeling?
- It sucks.
- Yeah.
- You wanna just clap once for me?
(boys clap)
And now the room is painted.
One of the girls convinced our camera guy
to borrow a drone to spy on the boys.
- We have the controls to the drone
and we're flying it over to the boys.
Oh my God, dude.
- Oh!
- We almost saw into the boys.
(dramatic music begins)
- [Man] Look at this dude. (laughs)
- [Mr Beast] And on night four,
we decided to let them
cook their own meal,
because tomorrow we'll
get much, much harder.
- We're 85 hours into this
and it's getting so close.
- I don't plan on leaving, there's no way.
- I don't think many of us will last.
I think the girls are winning.
(dramatic music continues)
- [Mr Beast] For the final
10 hours of the challenge,
we split each of the
circles into 10 sections.
There is now 10 hours
left in the challenge
and 10 zones in your circle.
So just so we're clear, if you touch
these red lines, you're out.
And every hour, they have to decide
which section to block off.
- And I think this one
should be our first choice.
(girls agree)
- [Mr Beast] Which led to some
pretty interesting conversations.
- We can fit nine in the porta potties,
so we can get real close.
- All right, boys, oh,
have you already decided?
- [Boy] We picked so quickly.
- [Boy] Yeah, we're blocking this off.
- Final decision?
- This one?
- Okay.
(dramatic music continues)
- The fact that it's
dead even after 90 hours
is so statistically improbable,
that it's crazy to me.
It's been an hour boys,
which one are we filling in?
Wait, the money pit?
They seem very confident and
they didn't seem on board.
- That side.
- Okay.
- It's time.
- [Girl] That one!
- Boys, what am I spray painting?
- [Boys] No more pit, no more pit.
- [Mr Beast] With only four hours left,
the teams were going over
how to best use the remaining space.
- There's no way we can
eliminate the money pit.
- It's the money pit or the porta potty.
- If we come... if we do
this, and then we just
cut it down, we have
more than enough room.
- [Mr Beast] Then this happened.
- Boys, boys, boys.
Change the lights.
I think you can guess what this means.
You'll see a finger drag across
(boys groan)
the red line.
Xavier, you clearly touched it.
Not only did Xavier get
out, this guy right here,
after he stepped out of the porta potty.
Look at all your reactions afterwards.
There's actually a third.
Who is that, good sir?
Come here, good sir, I'm sorry about that.
Boys, salute!
- We're losing people
'cause we're being sloppy.
If we cut that out, then we're good.
- [Mr Beast] After that,
everyone was careful,
and made it until the last
hour of the challenge.
It is officially the last hour.
So Chris, get to work.
Well, there's a pile of a bunch
of dudes in a porta potty.
Oh my gosh, how many are in there?
This last hour will determine who gets
the half a million dollars in cash.
(dramatic music begins)
- We're gonna make it.
- I just hope 33's enough.
(dramatic music intensifies)
- [Boys] Boys, boys,
boys, boys, boys, boys.
(dramatic music intensifies)
- [Boys] We will win!
- Ladies and gentlemen, the
challenge is officially over.
Meet me in the middle of the dome.
(boys cheer)
- [Boy] Let's go!
(girls scream and cheer)
- When we started, we had 100
girls and we had 100 boys.
These are all that remain.
After 100 hours, we have
33 boys and 35 girls.
(girls scream)
- [Girls] Girls, girls,
girls, girls, girls, girls.
- Congratulations, they just
won half a million dollars.
- 35.
Two people.
- My friend's gonna be so proud of me.
- If you haven't already subscribed,
we're closing in on
100 million subscribers
and it would mean the world to me.
Should they subscribe?
- [Girls] Yeah!
- I really wanna hit 100 million,
hit it if you haven't already.
♪ MrBeast6000, oh ♪"
vaIgyRoUkQI,"- I am not eating any food
for the next thirty days.
- Wait, won't you be hungry?
- [Jimmy] This is what
I currently look like,
and I weigh 220 pounds.
And when I say no food, I really mean it.
This was the hardest
I've ever pushed my body
in my entire life.
Seriously, do not try this at home.
I had a whole team of doctors
watching me every single day.
They kept track of all
my vitals, like these,
to ensure I didn't have
a heart attack, or worse.
Thanks, doctors!
And if I for any reason eat
food in the next 30 days,
Chris, you get to shave my head.
- No way! - Yes.
- There's no way he is going to 30 days.
We're shaving his head.
- The challenge has officially begun.
- Guess you won't need these.
(ceramic plate shattering)
- You're right. And
since I'm not eating for
the next 30 days,
I might as well get rid of
all the food in my house.
- Or are you eating?
- I'm not. - Or are you?
- I'm not eating.
And can you guys help me
get rid of all this food?
- Or is he?
- It's like legit, take all my food.
I don't want a single calorie
of food in this house.
- Jimmy, question.
If a fly flies into your mouth,
cause your mouth is open,
and you accidentally swallow
it does that count as eating?
- Uh, probably.
- Yeah, we're that serious.
- Enjoy the food!
I'll see you guys later.
You forgot the Cheetos. - Ow!
Tomorrow, we're bi...
- [Jimmy] Say it to the door.
All right, the challenge
is now getting serious.
The boys are gone, and my
kitchen is completely empty.
Also, Chris accidentally
broke my microwave.
(ceramic plate shattering)
- The microwave broke.
- Thanks a lot, Chris.
I'm laying in bed about to go to sleep,
and it feels weird not
having a snack before bed.
I'm staying strong.
I'll see you guys tomorrow.
Typically when I wake up
the first thing I do is
I go eat breakfast, but
obviously I can't do that now.
So, I guess I just go film videos.
The only thing going in
my mouth for the next
twenty-eight days is water.
Let's go see how much weight I've lost.
To be honest, I probably
weigh basically the same.
Yeah, like I said.
And I'm about to go start
filming a different video;
so today's gonna be a
pretty difficult day.
And the video we're filming is,
we're seeing if this man
can spend a hundred days
in this circle.
Comment which you think is harder,
spending a hundred days in a circle,
or not eating food for 30 days.
Filming on a completely empty stomach is
much harder than it sounds.
By the end of it, I was drained.
(Jimmy weary sighing)
That's probably like four
or five hours of filming,
and honestly, man, I need to go to bed.
I'm tired now.
- Hey, Chan-Chan, what you got there?
- [Chan] Oh, just some McDonald's.
- I'm blowing the smells your way.
- You are.
- Jimmy, you want to eat me.
- It's the end of day number two.
Not gonna lie, I'm actually really hungry,
and yeah, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
A lot of people say that
days three through six
are the hardest, but for
the most part I feel fine.
I'm just a little sluggish.
And I just feel tired.
Taking my first poop
since I started fasting.
(background bell chiming)
How much do I weigh?
So, I'm down two and a half
pounds in the last day.
That's actually pretty crazy.
But it does make sense,
because I took a giant poop this morning.
We're about to do a photo
shoot for my snack brand,
Feastables.
And it sucks, because I can't eat 'em,
and this is making me hungry.
That's me smiling through the pain.
You need me to take a bite of this?
- Yes.
- They want a photo of me
taking a bite of the bar.
Can I have permission?
I'll spit it out, I promise.
- [Chris] Yeah, you can
do that, if in the picture
you can have a shaved head.
- [Jimmy] I hate you.
All right, I'm hanging up.
Fake biting chocolate!
This morning I was like,
""Yeah, I'm not that hungry.
This isn't too hard.""
Now I'm like, ""Bro, I need to eat food.""
The boys told me they
have a surprise for me.
Which is basically a
nice way of them saying,
they're about to torture me.
- We just rented an ice cream truck.
- Cause we wanna shave Jimmy's head.
(frozen confection thudding)
Oh, I'm sorry, Tareq!
- All right, let's go!
(truck speaker trilling
Turkey in the Straw melody)
Yeah!
Oh, Jimmy!
- I hear music outside,...
- [Chandler] Jimmy!
- and now they're screaming my name.
- [Chris] Jimmy!
- Oh my gosh.
- [Chan] Hey.
- Hey, we got ice cream.
- [Jimmy] Did you use
my credit card for this?
- Of course we did.
What, would we use our own money?
- Of course.
Screw you guys.
It just clicked in my head
that these goofy, goobers
are gonna be try to tempt
me this entire time.
(frozen confection hitting house)
They're literally throwing
ice cream at my window.
- [Tareq] Oh my God.
(strained yelling)
(glass window shattering)
Did you guys just break the window?
- Jimmy!
- Jimmy, watch out for the
broken glass in the ice cream.
- You guys do realize I'm
renting this from a friend?
- [Friend] Hey, Jimmy, catch.
(frozen confection thudding)
Did you guys have fun?
- We have one more little trick.
- Oh, one more, of course.
- We do have one more.
- Let me guess you ordered pizza?
(background crickets chirping)
Okay, get out here.
Come on, all you guys go.
Merry Christmas! Happy Hanukkah!
The boys smashed a window,...
(window glass shattering)
and it doesn't seem safe
to sleep in a house with
an open window.
I decided to just sleep
over at a friend's house.
It's the morning.
And I woke up with a headache.
Doc said it should go
away within a day or two;
it's pretty normal.
So yeah, I'm probably
not gonna do much today.
Despite that I managed to drag
myself to the weigh in set,
turns out I lost another half a pound.
Good progress.
Anyways, back to bed
for the rest of the day.
Today is day five.
I'm going to check with the doctor,
check on the guy in the circle,
film some tik toks, and
then figure out how I buy
a private island for a
hundred million subscribers.
All right, I weigh 212.2 pounds.
I lost another three pounds
over the last 24 hours.
- Where does it go?
- Bro, I don't know.
- We should find it.
- Currently, I'm getting
blood work done to prove
to you guys, and Chris
that I haven't eaten.
Main thing I'm gonna be
looking for is a hormone
called leptin.
It will tell me whether
you're eating, or not.
They're gonna take a
couple days to come in.
- We'll await the results.
(electric razor buzzing)
- Today is day number six,
and for whatever reason,
I'm feeling really good.
I don't wanna get cocky,
cause I still have 24 days left,
but I'm starting to think
this is actually possible.
You guys know the deal,
two hundred and ten point one pounds.
Well, we're on 210 exactly.
Wow. This is Bitcoin this year.
And now it's time to go
check on the guy we trapped
in the circle.
We're filming the hundred
day in circle video.
And after talking really
loud, for a long time,
I'm very tired.
So I'm gonna just take a nap, probably.
So I did take a nap, in this guy's house,
and then we finished filming.
Need anything else?
- No, I think I'm good.
- See you in a week.
- A week.
It's currently midnight, and
the boys asked if I wanted
to hang out.
They're all just nomin' away.
I'm not gonna lie, in this
moment I am contemplating
shaving my head so I can eat some nachos.
Those look really good.
- You can have them.
(suspenseful background tune trilling)
- All right, I'm sticking to my water.
- Your loss.
- [Videographer] Good
morning, Jim. How you doing?
- I'm doing phenomenal,
because it's officially been
a week since I ate food.
And what better way to
celebrate this milestone
than some ice balls?
(ice spheres clattering)
(noisy ice crunching)
Ow! This was a lot funnier
in my head after seven days
without food; cut me some slack.
(ice cracking in sink)
This next shot is brought
to you from the side,
because Tareq didn't hit record.
Oh my gosh, I'm down almost
12 pounds since we started
in only a week.
Day seven was really busy.
First, I did my vital check at the studio.
(plastic packaging crackling)
- [Studio Worker] Bad, bad, no.
- Who left these laying around?
I want it so bad.
- [Studio Worker] Don't.
- You eat it for me.
Let me just watch you eat this Oreo.
This is sensational.
(background audience groaning)
Then I checked out some in progress sets
from an upcoming video.
And finally, me and Carl
filmed with Quackity
for the rest of the day.
- Well, I don't understand how
this constitutes as a talent.
- Mental toughness is a challenge.
I have ate food in seven days.
- What?
- [Jimmy] This challenge
is definitely starting
to wear me down.
So, um,...
(distant vehicle engine roaring)
For one of our coming up videos we're...
(diesel engine roaring)
Thank you, truck.
What I was trying to say,
is the chocolate factory
set was being built,
and I wanted to show you.
This is a chocolate fountain,
and that's how much chocolate
it requires to fill it.
Bro, being around these candies
are making me so hungry.
Why did we have to film
this during my fast?
The boys sent me a random DM saying,
they're playing basketball.
It's probably a horrible
idea, but screw it.
I literally air balled my first shot.
- [Nolan] He's definitely
a lot less energetic,
making less shots.
I didn't realize how weak
I was from not eating.
But despite that, I still
managed to score a little.
(Jimmy excited cheering)
So funny story, I just pooped,
and that's significant,
because this was my first
poop in over a week.
So I did some Googling,
and apparently this is a normal thing.
Not gonna lie,
it, it feels so weird to poop again.
I was recording some videos
for the reaction channel,
and it really just, it drained me, man.
- It's almost Jimmy James nap time.
He is low on calories.
- I'm, I'm low on the energies.
I also just didn't sleep
that well last night,
but I can barely keep my eyes open.
I'm on a couch in the studio,
and I'm literally just sleeping.
(background windows
computer tonal chiming)
On day 10 I flew out to New York,
to meet with Mark Rover.
Me and mark are about the
talk on the stage in front
of a bunch of very important people.
And I'm tired, and haven't ate food.
- I didn't know was
scientifically possible
to survive that long without food.
- [Jimmy] But back home, the
boys had their own plans.
- While Jimmy's in New York,
Tareq let us into his house,
and we've been filling
it with food all day.
- I've been eating all day.
- Stop. - Okay.
- [Mark] We removed
thirty-two and a half billion
pounds of trash.
(frame glass shattering)
(hammer loud tacking)
Brings us step closer to a cleaner world.
- Oh! - What? Stop!
You're making it splosh.
- [Jimmy] I recently
launched a chocolate brand,
and I thought it would be
fun to give you guys all some
chocolate bars.
(show audience cheering)
(background rock tune riffing)
- The talk went great,
and now I'm exhausted.
I'm going to bed.
- When Jimmy gets back
from New York, guys,
he's not gonna know what
hit him, but it was us.
He's definitely gonna eat,
and then we get to shave his head.
- Team Us!
(hands slapping)
(slow background melody chiming)
- [Jimmy] Hello?
- [Tareq] Hey, Jim.
Hey, listen, I can explain.
Were you in on this?
- [Tareq] I filmed it.
- Oh, it smells so good in here.
Please tell me it was just down here?
My bed?
Bro!
How badly do they wanna shave my head?
I'm FaceTiming Chandler.
What is this?
- Ya hungry?
- Yes, actually.
My stomach pain went
away for the most part,
but now it's throbbing.
- [Chandler] Did you check
under the toilet seats?
(background techno tune blaring)
- No, and because you said
that I'm not going to now.
- I'm in a chocolate factory,
watching people eat chocolate.
And it's been 12 days since I ate food.
Thirteen, twelve?
I don't even know what day.
And the day only got worse from there.
I was so nauseous that I couldn't film for
more than 20 minutes without
sitting down for a break.
Oh my God, I'm gonna throw up.
At one point, I almost scrapped the
chocolate factory video,
because I was so low energy.
- [Videographer] You want
to sit down for a second?
(Jimmy fatigued groaning)
And by the end of the day, I
felt like I was gonna pass out.
So we headed to check with the doctor.
(background show tune blaring)
I'm getting pretty low on energy.
So I'm gonna talk to the doctor,
and see what we should do.
- I think we should shave your head.
And then you can eat, and
then you'll feel better.
- True, it is actually
kind of tempting right now.
I really am hungry.
- Your hormone levels came back,
and it shows you are
doing good with your fast.
- I believe you.
I saw you sleep eight times today.
- It's definitely starting
to catch up to me.
- Your electrolytes still look good,
but I'm a little bit concerned
about your energy level.
When you start to feel worse,
we can always break the fast for your...
- Uhhh... - safety.
- Yeah, we can break the
hair off of your head too.
- And this is why you
need medical supervision
when you do these long fast.
I don't know what I'm doing.
I'm listening to him.
- [Videographer] Good night, man.
We'll see you on chocolate
factory tomorrow.
(Jimmy groggy muttering)
(ambient background melody chiming)
- [Jimmy] I had to fly out on day 13,
so I weighed myself from home.
That's 18 pounds under where
I started in just two weeks.
We're heading to Vegas
to film a quick clip
with Gordon Ramsey.
All this flying's really
start to catch up with me.
- [Flight Attendant] Would
you like some peanuts?
- Uh, no.
I would not like peanuts.
50 minutes past midnight,
so it's actually officially day 14.
It has been two weeks,
since I last day food,
our hotel room had a
bunch of snacks in it,
and Nolan won't stop
eating them in front of me.
- All I know how to do is eat chips.
- Tomorrow we're gonna be
cooking food for Gordon Ramsey,
or today cause it's 1:00 AM.
I'm hungry; I'm going to bed.
While filming with Gordon Ramsey,
I was trying to stay upbeat,
but I was really dying on the inside.
We just filmed with Gordon
Ramsey from one of our videos.
He has informed me, he
wants to cook me something
for his channel.
- But you can't eat.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
As far as YouTube channel,
Carl can taste test for me.
You know, it's how he's
one of the greatest chefs
to ever live, and by not
eating it I'd be passing up
a golden opportunity.
- Welcome to Scrambled, where
I'm cooking my favorite dish,
scrambled eggs.
With some close friends,
and today please welcome Mr. Beast.
- Thank you.
(hands clasping)
What a great hype, man.
I have to also say I'm doing
a video where I try not
to eat food for 30 days.
And if I do, I have to shave my head.
I'm gonna try not to eat what he makes.
I'm gonna make a sandwich,
and you're telling me now you're not gonna
(background record scratching)
eat it?
- It depends, unless it looks really good.
Uh oh, I pissed Gordon Ramsay off.
- Just take a little bite, right?
How do you fast for 30 days?
- Well, I'm not a doctor, so
I don't want to tell you how.
- When was the last time you had a poo?
- Uhh, oh God.
(men chuckling)
That does sound smell good.
- It's somehow...
- You're gonna make me cry.
- [Gordon] These are so special.
- Holy crap.
- They're beautiful.
- Oh my gosh.
- Breakfast sandwich...
Young man, come here.
At least take a bite.
You'll be the first person
in my entire career,
that I've cooked something
from start to finish...
If he's... Please,...
Just...
(Gordon chuckling)
- All right, I'll take one bite.
And I have to spit it out technically,
cause the refeeding syndrome,
but I still want to just taste it.
- So, you're breaking the fast?
- I'm gonna break the fast.
(background ethereal chiming)
- [Gordon] It's supposed to
be sloppy, rich, delicious...
- [Jimmy] I love it, I love it.
It's the best thing I've ever tasted...
in my life.
But you can't just have an influx of carbs
after not eating 14 days.
- Happy with that?
- I am, very happy.
Thank you.
(hands smacking)
- Right!
- I feel energized just having that in me.
Bro, after fourteen days...
There you have it, this jerk...
(Gordon chuckling)
is gonna make me shave my head.
Let's go do it.
A deal is a deal.
Chris, you can shave my head.
- Why do we have so many razors?
- I hate you, Gordon!
- I love you, Gordon. Thank you.
You ready? - Go for it.
I'm scared I'm going to mess
up, but I literally can't...
- Oh, lovely, lovely.
- Oh!
- That feels oddly good.
Tareq's just behind the camera like...
- Here let me...
- Just get it over with!
- I'm gonna leave you a little unicorn.
- Gosh.
(electric razor buzzing)
- Oh my God, that was so much hair.
- Oh, okay.
Okay, just let me see
that side real quick.
Look how thin the side of my head is.
I, all right, you know what?
I'm ending the video here.
I didn't trust Chris
with the razor anymore,
so this is my barber finishing up.
And this is the only
time you're gonna see me
like this.
For the next five months,
I'm gonna be wearing a hat.
Goodbye!
(background singer soulful vocalizing)
- You won't be needing these anymore.
(plate clattering)
It's a good plate."
Hwybp38GnZw,"- I've recreated Willy
Wonka's Chocolate Factory
in real life.
And one of these 10
people is gonna walk away
with this chocolate factory.
(all cheering)
- [Jimmy] In we go.
(all oohing and awing)
- [Chris] Wow.
- [Chandler] Yo.
- Welcome to my wonderful creation.
- Oh my gosh, it is Candy Land in here.
Look at the river!
- It's a chocolate door.
(chomping sound)
Oh he's taking a bite out of our door.
- That's good.
- [Jimmy] These 10
contestants are all here
because they found a golden ticket
when they bought one
of our Feastable Bars.
For our first challenge, we're
gonna play hide and seek.
You have a thousand seconds go hide.
(all talking)
- One, two, three, four.
- [Contestant] Oh okay, we gotta go hide.
Let's go. Let's go!
- Oh, look at this Coca-Cola
handle, oh my gosh.
- Oh, yo dude.
It's a marshmallow area,
what the heck is this?
(all counting)
- 201, 202, 5
- What about these?
I don't know if I can fit in here, see ya!
(lid clangs)
Anyhow.
- Hey, the factory's awesome.
- This doesn't feel real at
all, feels like I'm dreaming.
- Yo, what in the, what even is this area?
(dramatic music)
- Thousand, let's go!
If I were to hide anywhere in
Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory,
I'd probably hide in the chocolate river.
I don't feel like checking
it, so if they did they win.
It's one of our side rooms
in the chocolate factory.
- [Chandler] Cake.
- [Jimmy] No, no.
- [Chandler] I can't have any?
- Obviously you can't
have a chocolate factory
without offices to manage it.
No one in here.
Let's go this way.
- [Logan] Mm. Surely,
nobody's hiding in here.
- [Chris] I don't see anybody.
- [Logan] Nobody's in here either.
- And this is the Wollamhsram Room.
- [Tareq] What are you saying right now?
- That's marshmallow backwards.
- [Tareq] Oh, okay.
- Yeah, duh.
- Jimmy, oh, we were
just calling you Jimmy.
We found this really awesome hiding spot.
- Oh no.
- Oh no.
- [Jimmy] And it's the
guy dressed up cool.
- [Chris] It's the cowboy.
- No.
- All right, this way, watch
out for the giant candy cane.
You've seen the movie before, right?
- I have.
- All right then you know
you must get in the boat,
- In the boat.
- Don't ask me how but
we put a chocolate river
with a chocolate waterfall in
the middle of this warehouse.
(all saying bye)
(gun Shots)
- [Contestant] Bye Jimmy
- Part, the waterfall.
- I thought this was gonna stop, oh no.
(both yelling)
- The waterfall was supposed to part,
but I guess that messed up.
Our next challenge is on the
side of the Chocolate Factory.
I call it the Candy Wall of Death.
Sounds a lot scarier than it is.
Yes welcome!
- My gosh -
- Oh what the?
- So tall.
- Welcome to the rock wall.
(gong crashes)
- I gave Chris a gong.
The last person up the
candy wall is eliminated.
Contestants, are you ready?
(all shouting)
- Go!
- [Chris] Go, go, go, go.
- Okay.
Oh we already have someone fall.
Oh bro, that guy is
getting up there quick.
- Woo.
Are you all right, sir?
- Appreciate it.
- Let's go get up there.
- How does he know how to climb candy?
- Ah! -
- What'd you say?
- Ah! -
- Okay!
- For the Chocolate Factory!
- [Chris] This ain't no normal prize,
this is a whole factory.
(gong crashes)
- Ring the button, ring the button.
(bell rings)
- [Chris] Okay.
- [Contestant] Yes sir!
- [Female Contestant] Oh, I cannot.
- Remember, our chocolate
factory is on the line.
Actually the chocolate
factory you're climbing.
You gotta press the red button.
[bells ringing]
- Step on it. Step on
something else with your leg.
- Don't let a Reese's Pieces
cost you a chocolate factory.
- [Contestant] I can't.
[all shouting]
- [Jimmy] You can keep going.
- (all shouting)
- These two were unable
to make it to the top.
So the only logical thing to
do is rock, paper, scissors.
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!
- Oh I got it.
- Well, congratulations.
Let's head over to the chocolate river.
Here's an umbrella in case the
waterfall malfunctions again.
- [Everyone] Bye!
- [Chris] Who would've thought
a river made of chocolate
is not very practical?
- And now that she's gone,
pair up into groups of two.
Is everyone happy with their partners?
- [Everyone] Yeah.
- All right, Next challenge.
And now we have the two
greatest eaters in the world.
Get out the way.
- [Chris] Excuse me.
- Matt Stonie and Joey Chestnut.
(all cheering)
And they're gonna demonstrate
the next challenge.
Bring out the chocolate,
not this chocolate.
This is our chocolate bars
that you can order online.
And we have two brand new Feastables bars:
milk chocolate and sea salt.
Can you show us how to speed eat this?
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.
- Hey, all you guys should take notes.
(crunching sounds)
- [Chris] That's insane.
(slurping sounds)
- I feel like I'm gonna
throw up just watching them.
(uptempo music)
- I think you all get the gist,
last team to eat the chocolate
bars, obviously eliminated.
Begin the contest.
- [Contestant] Go for it.
- The challenge has officially started.
Two people will lose.
- You guys literally
saw what you have to do.
Shove it in your mouth and
then shove water in your mouth.
- Chew and swallow, chew and swallow.
Water's your best friend. Keep it going.
- Keep it going in your mouth.
- I think they've made
the most progress so far.
- I'm lactose intolerant.
(squeaky laughter)
- That's dark chocolate,
not milk chocolate.
So you're good.
- I'm good.
- Yeah!
- [Logan] There's a chocolate
factory on the line.
- I've been trying really
hard to lose weight.
This is like counterproductive.
- It's getting hot.
- You doing okay?
- Mm-hm
- Bro, you're sweating,
can someone gimme a napkin?
(mumbling)
(dramatic music)
- They are officially our first winners.
- Yeah -
- Yeah we did it!
- You technically haven't
won until you swallow that.
(swallowing hard)
- We got our first winners over there.
- It doesn't matter who wins.
It just matters who loses.
- Come on you got this
- That team was in last place.
Now they're gonna come
back and beat you guys.
- You got plenty of time.
Just focus on getting it down, mouth open.
Hey, we got it!
- Yes!
- Those two guys are getting close.
It's kind of now or never for you guys.
- They are about ready to finish.
You guys have to go fast right now.
- Slam it back
- Right now!
- Chris, are they are they
- They're chewing, they're
chewing their last piece.
- Swallow it, swallow it and you can win.
- First one to clear, we gotta
see open mouth, open mouth.
- All right, his mouth's
empty, its down to him.
- Get it out, get it out.
Yeah. Got it.
- His mouth's empty, so done.
- Oh yeah!
- So close!
- The chocolate's amazing.
But at a portion, oh my God.
- To the chocolate river.
Goodbye.
- What's it like being
in the chocolate river
after eating a pound of chocolate?
- I don't know.
- Make sure you watch the end
of the video because I have a
special surprise guest
that will blow your mind.
And now the final six
contestants are outside.
And can you guys take your blindfolds off
and look to the right?
This is the one's largest bottle of Coke.
Chandler, can you hold my cane?
- Yes.
(claps hands)
- [Jimmy] And there we
go, editing is cool.
- How'd I get up here?
- If you land the world's largest Mento
in the world's largest
bottle of Coke, you win.
Don't forget this building,
everything you know is on the line.
- This is half a million dollars.
- Well, I mean, if not more.
- Uh. -
- Oh
- In, in the bottle.
- Yes. In the bottle.
- No, no, no, no, in!
- Let's see how many times we
can get Chandler to say that.
Don't forget if you make
this that could determine
whether or not you want
a chocolate factory.
- First try.
- I think that was the worst one yet.
[Dramatic Music]
- [Everyone] Oh!
- In and out!
- [Chandler] This is it, this is the one.
- [Everyone] Yeah!
- Let's go!
(all cheering)
- It flew so high.
- Whoever wins the Chocolate Factory,
you might have a, a
little stain on the side.
Since he was the one that made the shot,
he gets to pick who's eliminated,
look at these five people right here.
- Oh, this is hard.
- I mean, it could be you if you want.
- No, I think I'll pass on that,
(all laughing)
Eric, I'm sorry.
(crowd groans)
- I don't know I'm, please forgive me man.
- Well, you know what that
means, chocolate river.
This is a smaller version of
the Mentos you were throwing.
And if you look right here,
here is a solid gold Mentos.
Here you go, you can sell it
when you leave the factory.
- You better win this now.
- I'm sorry, man, I'm sorry.
- If you're wondering where that goes.
I don't even know, next challenge.
Now we're in a room
covered with marshmallows.
Dive on the floor.
(Logan grunts)
Did that hurt?
- No, not at all.
- And in front of each of the contest,
I don't trust you with the flamethrower.
Can you stand just a little more that way.
And in front of each contestants,
it's a little peppermint
carousel, can you all stand on it?
The challenge has officially begun.
Whoever falls off first loses.
- Do you feel bad about what you did?
- I feel awful.
- All right, just step off it.
- No, I won't do it.
- You can do it
- No.
- Don't push.
- Currently they're not spinning.
So let's move this here.
Now they're spinning just a
little bit, how is it everybody?
- Pretty fine
- Pretty good?
- Good so far.
- So far so good.
- Whoa.
- I think he was making fun of it.
You want me to ramp it up?
- I dare you.
- All right, we're ramping it up.
Now they're spinning faster.
They all kinda look like MPCs, you know,
in the character
selection where they spin.
You know what I mean?
If you step here, step
right while you're doing it,
it'll help you with the sickness.
Like 'cause you don't have to spin,
you can just step in place.
- Don't trust Jimmy. I don't trust that.
- That seems scary. Oh, oh.
(everyone yelling)
- What do you do now?
(everyone yelling)
- Why did that hit me in the head?
- Even though he got out,
I wanna show you guys
the faster speeds 'cause
I spent a lot of money on this.
- [Jimmy] Look at him over there.
- Ah!
- I can't feel my toes.
- To the river.
Before you step in the boat,
I need you to assign them a number.
One through four to each
of them, who is number one?
- Dallin. -
- One?
- Okay, so who's number two?
- Justin.
- Number three?
- Brian
- Are you just going
in order of the layout?
- I really am.
- Oh, that's cheap.
All right, fine, get in the boat.
- One last sweet treat
for the road, my guy.
- Ah, thank you.
Watch you fall in.
- That could determine who
loses a chocolate factory.
Let's show you why that's relevant.
There's four toilets behind me.
Three are real, ones made of a cake.
Whichever person picks the
cake one is eliminated.
- So if they're right they're wrong?
- No, they have to be
right about the wrong one.
- [Jimmy] I'm not joking.
One of those toilets is
literally made of cake
and whoever picks the cake toilet
loses the chocolate factory.
We're gonna start things off
with number one over here.
Take your blindfold off,
you have five seconds.
Five, four, three, two
- Two.
- Alight.
So you're picking toilet number two.
Stand in front of it and face this way.
Now we have number two, are you ready?
- Yep.
- Take the blindfold off.
Five, four, three,
- [Contestant] One.
- Okay, go for it.
Alight, that leaves only
toilet three and four left.
Five, four, three, two
- Three
- Okay, you pick toilet number three.
So I hate to break the news to you,
but there's only one toilet left.
So you can just go walk in front of it.
Three of these toilets are real.
One is made of cake,
can you guys sit down?
(intense music)
- Oh. -
- Oh yeah.
- Everyone his toilet
was the one made of cake.
- [Contestant] No, man.
- Oh my God the cane.
- The cane is no more.
I don't know if you guys have
ever made a toilet out a cake,
but this took forever.
So please subscribe.
- Can you flush that?
[Everyone Laughs]
- You know the deal, on the bridge.
- Better you than me dude.
- [Jimmy] Oh my God.
- Sorry, but you had to go at some point,
if I was gonna win.
- Have fun in Arizona, I'll
see you soon down there.
- {Jimmy} Oh my gosh.
- Oh, I don't know if
this is wholesome or not.
- Hey, don't worry Jimmy.
Being a boat captain's a piece of cake.
(strong base)
- And we have one final challenge left
that will decide which
one of you walks away
with this chocolate factory.
We have these three contestants.
And what better person to
decide which one of you wins
a chocolate factory than,
come on in, Gordon Ramsey, turn around.
- Oh my gosh. -
- No way.
- How's it going man?
And as you're probably guessing,
the final challenge is a cooking challenge
and they have 45 minutes to make a dessert
for Gordon Ramsey to judge.
He'll be judging on looks and taste,
Begin!
(clicking timer)
- Yes -
- Okay.
- Don't forget a chocolate
factory's on the line.
I don't normally do these
cooking shows, what do we do now?
- So this is tough on them, by the way,
for the finale, they
have 45 minutes to cook.
That's that's,
- [Jimmy] That's not a lot of time?
- That's not a lot of time.
- Oh I just made up a random number.
- Right, goodness how are we doing?
- I have no idea. I'm just,
- You have no idea?
- I'm looking at
ingredients and I'm trying
to figure out what everything is.
- So you've never done this recipe before?
- I don't know how to cook,
I'm just going for it.
(Jimmy laughing)
- What are you working on?
- I need to make a cheesecake,
which I just found.
Probably shouldn't put that on the stove.
(both giggling)
- I'm starting off with a funfetti cake.
- How much chocolate you putting in there?
- I'm gonna keep the chocolate
outta the funfetti cake.
It's gonna come in at a later moment.
- A later moment?
We haven't got much time.
We've only got 45 minutes.
- A little stressed out right now.
- Are you okay?
- I'm good. I'm good.
- He makes everything so
much more intense, I love it.
- What's the dessert?
Look at me, you've done nothing yet.
- There's, there's a few
different ones. So I'm gonna,
- A few different ones?
- Yes.
- You have 45 minutes.
Can you work and talk at the same time?
- I was about to say the same thing.
- I probably should.
(all chattering)
- Honestly, I don't even know what to do.
Gordon just kind of took over
and it's really entertaining.
- Just over 20 minutes, halfway guys,
halfway to a amazing chocolate factory.
- When I win this chocolate factory,
do you wanna buy it off of me?
(both laughing)
- I'm gonna see what you make first.
- Oh my gosh the cockiness.
He decides whether or not you
win the chocolate factory.
- Oh I know, I'm aware.
- Hey psst.
- Yes.
- Turn the gas on.
- I probably should.
- Yeah, oh my God.
- Did you know how to
make brownies before this?
- Uh I have, but not with no instructions.
- Here we go.
- Lets go champ.
- Gotta get this in here.
(people laughing)
(torch firing)
- You're burning the mat.
The mat is burning.
- Oh shoot, you're right!
Just a light flame, that's
like eight inches long.
- So we're, we're good
with fire extinguishers.
- And I don't think
marshmallows whisk like that.
- I don't know.
We're we're gonna find out though.
- Oh my god.
- Don't come over here, Gordon.
- What have you done there?
- I don't know.
- It looks like you cooked it, ate it,
then threw it back up.
- Oh man.
- I think Gordon's
about to have a seizure.
- Two minutes.
- Hey, you want me to
blow torch this for you?
- Uh no, not yet.
- All right, how about now?
- Not yet.
- Stop harassing the contestants.
- What Gordon's gonna want
is you to make it sound
like you put in a lot of effort.
So if you start using adjectives
that chefs like hearing,
I put the nerds rope
here because it really
contradicts the chocolate really lets you.
- Shut it down, 15 seconds to go.
- Three
(crashing dishes)
- Oh my gosh.
- Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
Come on Christian.
Five, four, three,
two, one.
And stop, hands in the air.
- [Jimmy] Done.
Gordon will now begin
judging all three dishes.
He's gonna give him a score one outta 10
on looks and a score one outta 10,
based on how it tastes.
Person with the highest score
at the end wins the chocolate factory.
- Justin, describe the dish.
- This is Rocky Road on a cone.
I melted the marshmallows on top.
I had a marshmallow at the
bottom 'cause I didn't know
what to do at the bottom, so.
(all laughing)
- I don't what looks worse.
The one at the bottom or the one on top.
(all laughing)
So visually it looks a
little bit pedestrian.
- I'll take that.
- It looks like you've dropped it.
I'm gonna give that a
five out of 10, right?
Wow.
How do we, does this
come with instructions?
- Yeah, one honest bite.
(spits out bite)
- Oh, well.
(laughing)
(explosive sound)
(loud laughing)
- Five.
- Five. So 10 total.
- 10 total.
- All right. It's a 10 of 20.
So.
- It looks like a bum's got
off there, what happened there?
- No it looked great before
and then the last minute he
somehow managed to ruin
his whole creation.
- On top I have a whipped cream.
That's actually melted.
It's not there anymore.
And then I've got
caramelized bananas sitting
on top of coconut covered,
chocolate covered marshmallows.
- Have you ever heard the word stop?
(Jimmy laughing)
Less is More? - I was
thinking the same thing.
- Yes.
- Yeah, so visually it looks a mess.
Three outta 10,
Taste wise, what's the liquid?
Why is it gone all liq.. What do you do?
- The syrup flooded out and
then it was, it was too much.
- It's good?
- No, it's not, I know, It's not.
- What did you put in there?
I'm gonna give that a five.
- All right, you have
no way of winning, so.
- Thank you guys, it was a lot of fun.
It was really nice to meet you.
- Likewise, likewise.
- You know, just for that,
we're gonna give him $10,000
for coming out.
(people clapping)
- Thank you so much.
- All right, but you
lost, I'll see you later.
- Bye guys.
- All right, so I've
created a funfetti cake,
chocolate river from the Willy
Wonka Factory with the boat
in the middle that goes
on through the waterfall.
Had to add a lot of color.
There's a lot of color in the factory.
- Visually. I think this looks the best.
- I like the story.
So visually it's it's a
strong it's it's a seven.
- You only had 10.
It's already close and
he hasn't ate it yet.
- Sponge the funfetti is always better,
light fluffy, but I'm nervous.
- Yeah?
- Uh oh.
- What do you think?
I can't tell if he's about
to be the worst cake ever
or like, oh, it was decent.
- Right there.
- Oh my gosh.
- Is a seven out 10, congratulations.
- Yes.
(all celebrating)
- That's it, Congratulations.
- Congratulations,
- Here's the deed.
- Give me this!
- He just won this Chocolate Factory.
- It's all mine!
- To celebrate our launch of
milk chocolate and sea salt,
we went out, we bought
10 Teslas, loads of cash,
and all these prizes
you see on the screen.
And prizes aside, unlike Hershey's,
these bars only have
four to five ingredients
and just genuinely taste good.
Go to feastables.com right
now and order some chocolate.
Only problem is the chocolate
river is deteriorating.
All the candy is going bad.
There's probably a million flies in there
and it costs a lot of money to upkeep,
so I'll be right back.
Right here is half a
million dollars in cash.
Will you sell me your
chocolate factory for
half a million dollars?
'Cause if not, it's
probably gonna cost you
over a hundred grand a year to maintain.
- I've never seen so
much money in my life.
Will you buy this off of me?
- Yes.
- For half a million dollars?
- Oh, of course right here.
- This is mine.
- If you hand me this, you can
put this money in your car.
- I officially hand it to you.
- Okay.
- Yes! -
- Well, there you go!
- This is mine, oh my god!
(Explosion)
♪ Mr. Beast, oh ♪
(explosion)"
hD1YtmKXNb4,"- Every day, he survives in this room,
I give him $10,000.
We literally have a million
dollars in cash here.
So if he survives a hundred days
he can become a millionaire.
- You're gonna be poor.
- At any point if you
want to end the challenge
and leave just press this red button.
- Got it.
- You wanna demonstrate it for us?
- No, you're not gonna have it that easy.
- I'm gonna dramatically seal the door.
Good luck.
- So this is my apartment now
but instead of paying
rent, I make $10,000 a day.
This is gonna be very easy.
Very easy.
(ominous music)
(upbeat music)
Right there. Woo.
Oh my God.
(drum beats)
- Oh, it's disco time.
- Stop messing with the lights, please.
♪ La la la la la la la la ♪
- [Jim] Josh seems to think
that this is gonna be easy.
I don't think he understands just how hard
this is gonna get.
(mellow music)
- So I just woke up after
my first night sleeping here
and I'm probably just
gonna jump on the treadmill
and then eat some breakfast or something.
I don't know.
(rock music)
- Hello there, Josh.
It has officially been 24 hours,
but I left out a key element.
When I give you the $10,000 like this,
you have to let me take
one item from this room.
You have 10 seconds to hand me an item.
- 10 seconds?
- Nine, eight,
- Three.
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.
I'm gonna give you the ice cream machine.
- Chris, Chandler you know what to do.
Okay.
- [Josh] Oh my god!
- Chandler!
(drum roll)
(cheers)
- [Josh] There you go.
- You just got rid of
the ice cream machine
which means you have 24
items left in this room
to get rid of.
And now that we just flipped
your world upside down
I'm gonna leave.
- Thanks, Jim.
So this genuinely changes everything.
I'm actually worried about
what I'm gonna have to choose between
like family portrait or the guitar.
On one hand something to keep me busy.
But that's also the only
time I can see my girlfriend
is looking at that picture.
I just need to be strategic with the items
that I'm giving away.
Make sure I've got enough
to keep me occupied
for the long run.
(bright music)
- Hey, get off the computer.
Take the money.
- Oh, wait, why'd you throw it
Give us an item, in a nice way.
- This is the item that I will give you.
- Do you wanna give us another item?
- What's in it for me?
- Nothing.
- Then no.
- [Jim] Okay.
(upbeat music)
- Here's another $10,000.
I request an item.
- I got a for you right here, Jimmy.
- What item do you think
you'll get rid of next?
- I think I'm gonna get
rid of the whiteboard next
because I can write on the walls.
He left, didn't he?
- To make sure Josh was comfortable here
I gave him a private
chef that will cook him
literally anything he wants.
- This is ridiculous.
Let's try this.
Oh my God.
This is the best thing I've ever had.
(sentimental guitar music)
(Carl screams)
- Add it to the pile, boys.
- I'll add another 5,000 if
you let Carl pick the item.
Three, two, one.
- Okay fine.
- Wait, really?
- The picture of him with his sister.
- Carl.
- This'll look great in my living room.
- I'm gonna go insane now.
That's the only time I
can see my girlfriend.
- I have to go film a video on sharks.
So Carl's gonna take care of you tomorrow.
- Is there literally anyone
else in the universe that can
- No
- So I'm in charge?
- You're screwed.
- That's not gonna fit in the hot tub.
It's not gonna fit.
- There's water everywhere.
- Whoa, no, Carl.
I'm getting the flame thrower, no!
- Keep the markers.
(dramatic classical music)
- So I'm getting rid
of the drum set today.
(heavy rock music)
Oh no.
I'd say that's is a
pretty eventful morning.
- Oh, you broke your drum set.
This makes me wanna ask,
mentally are you okay?
- Yeah, I mean actually,
got a lot of rage out
so now I'm feeling really loose.
- All right.
He doesn't know,
but there's a check for a
hundred thousand dollars
hidden in that guitar.
If he gets rid the guitar
without noticing it
that's a hundred thousand
dollars down, shh.
Josh's room was getting pretty messy.
So I paid a cleaning crew to
come in and take care of it
and he somehow slept through all of it.
It has officially been
eight days in this room
and for whatever reason,
he's asleep at 6:00 PM.
- Probably 'cause he's bored.
- Good morning, Josh. Even though 6:00 PM.
- Here's another 10 grand in cash.
What's the item for today?
- The flame thrower.
- All right, the flame thrower is gone.
We totally don't have
anything else planned
while we're here.
- Jimmy, what about?
- That's it, don't give
it away, Christopher.
- That didn't seem
suspicious at all, for sure.
(angelic music)
- Wait, why is my face so distorted?
I'm gonna hand it off to Chris
and you know how dumb he can get.
- I am your god.
- Chris, do you have to
be so close to the mic?
Show me the outside world.
- You can't see anything
except for like the black sky.
- Is it dark outside already?
- Yeah.
- I've really lost all concept of time.
- All right Jimmy, I'm gonna come get you.
- What's that over there?
(guitar music)
If Nolan spends the next 24 hours with you
I'll give you an extra 10 grand today.
- Do I get money too?
- No, just him.
- So I just have to stay in here?
- Ready to start the challenge?
- Yeah, we're chillin', let's do it.
- One, two, three, four.
(upbeat music)
- You shouldn't have
gotten rid of the drums.
- I know, dude.
(upbeat music)
(Hip Hop music)
- All right, I'm done. I'm going home.
- Nolan, you're not leaving.
- I am leaving.
- No, no, no, no.
- I'm pressing the button.
Okay, it has a little bit
of battery left on it.
(upbeat music)
- It's you.
- Chill!
- I can't take it anymore,
they won't open the doors.
Are you kidding? There's another wall.
Dunk contest.
- All right, let's go.
Yes.
- Just two dudes in a hot tub.
- Boys, there's another digit.
- Do you even know what that means?
- No.
- Can I just say whatever I want
and you guys just don't question it?
- Yes.
- Yes.
- To celebrate 10 days
we had a custom $10,000,
five foot cake made for you.
- Oh my God.
- Guys, guys, guys.
- I don't know what to do.
I'm just gonna stand
back and let this happen.
- What do you mean let it happen?
- Eat it.
- Oh my God, it's incredible.
- Even though the cake is a mess
there's some of our Feastables bars on it.
Just go to feastables.com,
they taste amazing.
- It's so much better than the cake.
- Enjoy your $10,000 cake.
- Bye Jimmy.
As of today, I am now at $115,000
thanks to the extra 10 grand
for Nolan staying here.
(upbeat music)
- What up Josh?
Sorry I couldn't be there today.
I'm out of town filming a different video
but we still gotta give you your 10 grand.
Do it.
- Oh my God.
- Throw an item outside the door.
- Here we go, boys.
- Mission complete.
Josh is getting super lonely.
Every time I talk to him,
he mentions how much he
misses his girlfriend.
Every day we've been grabbing
a briefcase from this pile
and look how much it's shrunk.
Would you rather,
I deliver you another
10 grand in a briefcase
or your girlfriend delivers it
but it only has five grand in it.
- Is she here?
- Yeah, right outside.
- Oh yeah, five grand. I don't care.
- As I promised you simp,
here's your girlfriend.
- Oh my God.
- Hey.
- Put that down, I don't care.
- Here's your money.
- They look so happy.
He's gone 12 days without
seeing his girlfriend.
- Been the longest that we've gone
without seeing each other
in our entire six year relationship.
- Also, I forgot to mention
that you only have 10 minutes
and it's been like three, so
you have like seven minutes?
- No.
- Ah.
- I feel like as long as I know
that you're doing okay out there,
I'm gonna be doing fine in here.
It's kind of like surreal that
you're even here right now.
- I hate to ruin the moment
but the 10 minute timer is up.
- No!
- I'm deaf now.
Love you, bye.
- Ah, I don't know if
this helped or hurted me.
I hurt.
- [Jim] On day 13 Josh
reminded me of a $10,000 bet
he made with Chandler.
- I'll bet you 10 grand
I go longer than 10 days.
- All right, deal.
- I'll bet you 10 more
of Jimmy's thousands.
- How about, I don't
care what he's saying?
Take this, no more bets.
- I actually want you
guys to take this 20 grand
and I want you to buy a ring with it
because I'm gonna propose to my girlfriend
at the end of this video.
- Oh wow.
- Are you sure you trust these
hooligans to buy you a ring?
- I don't, but I have no other choice.
On a real note though,
I have been wanting to propose
to Kenna for years now.
Being trapped in here has made me realize
how valuable time is.
I'm just done waiting.
- [Jim] So the audio might
have gotten messed up here.
- We're at the local diamond shop.
- [Jim] But Chris and Chandler
still made a deal with the jeweler
and found the exact ring
that Josh was looking for.
- Yay Josh.
We're back.
- So this is your first time ever
seeing your wedding ring.
- Yeah, this is crazy.
- Yo, that's insane.
Bits aside, this is exactly what I wanted.
I literally can't stop
looking at this ring
but to be honest it's
making me want to get out
more than anything.
Every day I spend in here
it's like I'm holding myself
back from being engaged.
- [Jim] Josh has now made $160,000
and been inside of this
room for two weeks.
And I was out of town on day 15
so I had to FaceTime Josh
with a special guest.
- Hey buddy.
- Is that Jake Paul?
- You're just winning at life.
(classical music)
- A perfect centerpiece to my room.
The recliner's gone, I'm
now down to nine items
and I have no clue what
I'm gonna give up next.
I don't look stupid playing VR.
You look stupid playing VR.
Oh my God. Oh no.
Oh no.
No.
It's gonna be the treadmill.
Nolan's here to hang out.
- What was that?
Ah.
Whoa.
Ow, what is that?
- Maybe this is cheering
me up a little bit.
Knowing that I could leave
right now with 190 grand
is making it incredibly difficult.
It's honestly like the lack of fresh air.
I feel sick.
The doctor checked me out today.
My throat's like kind of messed up.
Slightly considered the
possibility of pushing the button.
- Boohoo, I'm Josh.
I'm making hundreds of
thousands of dollars
to lay in a room and do nothing.
- Okay. Are you mocking me right now?
- No, no, no no. Here's your 10 grand.
What's the item?
It's gonna be the VR.
- Then what are you gonna do tomorrow?
- Play guitar I guess.
- You sound defeated.
- A lot of you guys are probably like,
oh this would be a cakewalk,
it's the easiest thing ever.
But it's something you truly
won't understand until you--
- You know what? You're right.
It's very hard, you should just leave.
- No, I can't.
- Hello Josh.
- What's going on?
- Is he wearing his
clothes on the hot tub?
Buddy, how you doing?
- I'm just existing right now.
- Just existing in the hot tub.
The item he's getting
rid of is the hot tub.
- Mm-hmm.
- You're in charge of removing it.
Turn on the lights.
- Here we go.
- I don't think it'll fit.
- Wouldn't it just be easier to drain
and disassemble the hot tub in the room?
- Wouldn't it be easier
to worry about yourself?
- That's fair.
(saw whirring)
I think I can ram the forklift into it
and it'll just fall.
- Oh no.
Oh my God.
Oh my god.
- Honestly, Jim this is the
most excitement I've had
the whole time I've been here.
- This is actually very entertaining.
Just watching him being idiot.
- Oh, stop, stop, stop, stop.
- Oh my God, my room.
- Oh no, I'm getting the rug pulled on me.
- What is going on?
(horn honks)
- Oh God, oh God.
- Okay, oh he made it.
- How is this going well right now?
(wood cracks)
- Am I going through the floor?
- You're about to.
- Oh my God, get it out, go.
(Chris screams)
Oh my god, the floor.
(Chris screams)
Oh my god.
- He got it out.
- Let's go.
- [Jim] Oh yeah, oh.
And that concludes Chris being an idiot.
Here's what things look like
at the start of the video.
And here's what things look like now.
I think the forklift tire
marks really add character.
- I mean, look at this place.
I feel like I'm living
in a construction zone.
(upbeat music)
Oh my God I forgot about
all the water jugs.
Early on, I had to fill my
hot tub up with more water
'cause it was getting low
and I threw these up here.
Can you gimme the stars?
(mellow music)
- Lights on.
What up, Josh? Josh?
- I'm up here, Jim?
- Here's your 10 grand for the day.
What item are you giving up?
- I think it's gonna be
the pool table today.
Jimmy, can you let me down first?
Jimmy no.
I don't want to be here anymore.
- Then leave. I just made you rich.
- Yeah, I know, thanks Jim.
Hey, on a real note, you're the best.
- I love you.
Speaking of love, I
talked to your girlfriend
and she said, she misses you a lot.
- Bro.
- That's enough human interaction.
If you survive the night
we'll bring a ladder in the morning.
- I miss everything outside of this dome.
(guitar music)
I just keep thinking about Kenna.
- [Jim] I think Josh is
getting sick of people
watching him all the time.
- Let's go.
Nope.
Oh no.
- What are you getting rid of?
- Basketball.
- Say no more.
- Oh my god.
- Honestly now the most
exciting part of my day
is them taking my items.
- All he has left to live
off of is this guitar
and this bed, and 230 grand.
- It's less depressing when
you add that at the end.
Because I kept the whole bed together
I only have the guitar
and now I need to start sacrificing sleep.
(dramatic music)
(string twangs)
That's it, that's the last straw.
I just broke the string on the one thing
that was remotely keeping me insane.
Keeping me sane.
I can't even talk.
(dramatic music)
Woo. Oh, that felt good.
What is this?
(guitar music)
What? Is this a check for a hundred grand?
Woo. Let's go.
- What's up Josh?
- Look what I found, Jimmy.
- Why'd you smash it?
- There's my item.
11 briefcases for today.
- There you go.
- Beautiful. Jimmy, it's time.
Go get Kenna.
- You want me to go get your girlfriend?
- Right now.
- Are you sure?
- I am 100% sure.
- You don't want to stay in this room?
- I made 340 grand, I'm done.
I'm good. We're doing this thing now.
- Okay.
- And I'm leaving.
- Enjoy the last few
moments before he gets out.
- I just want to talk for a minute.
Like on a real note,
spending this time apart from you
has made me realize even more
just how much I love you and need you.
- He's about to do it.
He's about to do it.
- I wanna spend the
rest of my life with you
and I want to grow old with you.
And I need to ask you a question.
- Oh my God.
- Will you marry me?
- Yes, yes.
- Oh!
(Kenna laughs)
(Josh laughs)
- They tripped over the
money they just won.
- [Jim] And on top of that,
we brought your family out.
- Oh my god.
(upbeat music)
- Okay, let's take a step out.
- Let's go.
- You're gonna make me cry, Josh.
- If you haven't already,
subscribe. Goodbye.
Someone random that
subscribes to this channel
in the next seven days will
receive $10,000 in cash.
That's right guys, we're
closing in on my dream
of 100 million subscribers
and I really wanna hit it.
It would mean the world to me.
So subscribe if you haven't already
because you could win $10,000 in cash.
- Woo, fresh air baby."
LnlKwzc_TNA,"- We are currently surrounded
by countless sharks.
Maybe even a thousand.
I don't think it's that many.
And in this backpack,
it's a hundred grand.
And if you retrieve that a
hundred thousand dollars in cash,
I'll give it to your number one fan.
- Oh.
- Who's conveniently right here.
- Oh!
- Let's go, Chris.
Okay. Let's go baby.
- There's literally shark-
look Tareq, Tareq, Tareq.
- Oh my God.
- The sooner you get the
money, the sooner you're out!
- Got it.
Oh really?
Got it.
Gotta make it back.
Get back to this boat.
- Here's your a hundred
thousand dollars in cash.
If I was you, I'd kiss Chris.
This is my friend Airrack.
To your right is the
coldest room in the world.
- It's freezing in here.
- And to your left is the
hottest room in the world.
- Youch!
- Hot or cold? Pick.
- They're both horrible
options, but I'm gonna go cold.
Oh my gosh.
Bro, this is freezing.
- At least in here you have a bed.
- What is this, Jimmy?
- Every hour you survive in this room,
I'll give a random person 10 grand.
- Starting right now?
- Starting now.
- No.
- The time starts now.
- You better stay in there.
I'm not leaving here
until you win millions.
- That's right, man!
You and I are gonna bankrupt Jimmy today.
- This is what 10 grand
looks like by the way.
- Hey, Hey, it hasn't been
an hour. Get outta here.
We'll see you guys in a little bit.
For this next challenge,
we brought back something
I know you all love.
Glass Bridge.
And we brought back 4,
5, 6 from our squid game.
It's pretty simple.
You guess a platform left or right.
If you pick wrong, you fall.
And if you can make it to the other side
I'll let you keep the
456 grand over there.
- 15 Platforms?
- I'm gonna give you a hand.
Pick right on the first one.
- Oh.
- Now obviously the
probability of him getting
to the other side of this
bridge is extremely low.
So I'm just gonna tell you the answers.
You jumped right,
then it's left, left, left,
right, right,
left, left, left,
right, left,
right, right, right left.
You should get to jumping
before you forget.
- All right. It's left for sure.
- Correct. 13 more, John,
456 grand on the line.
- This one
- It was three lefts in a row.
Sucks for 456.
We brought back 067.
The correct answer is right.
And if you can make it
all the way to the end
I'll let you keep the
456 grand over there.
I'm gonna give you all the rest.
Right, left, left, left,
right, right, left, left,
left, right, left,
right, right, right left.
- Can I get that again?
- No.
- Oh, all right.
- Your heart looked like it stopped there.
- It did.
if you could just-
- That's the good option.
- Oh my God.
- That is not the good option.
- Oh, are you okay?
- Yeah.
I'm good.
- I'm not gonna lie,
I thought they would
make it a little further.
Chris.
- Oh, no.
So you have heard me say all the answers
to two different people?
- It's a bad time to
have a horrible memory.
Oh gosh.
Am I gonna die?
Am I waiting to die?
- I am so glad you picked
the right one here.
- No, I picked the left one.
- Oh gosh. He went.
I give up. Next bit.
- So my plan as of right
now is to snuggle up
in this ice bed that Jimmy has made for me
and pretty much just sleep
through this entire day.
- Now we're back at the
world's coldest room
and it's officially been an hour.
So here's 10 grand.
You've suffered for an hour.
She's won 10 grand.
How are you doing?
- I'm feeling like you need to go get more
of those briefcases out.
- Almost the entire time lapse
you're laying in the bed.
Were you actually asleep?
- I'm sleeping.
Yeah, it was great.
- Hey Chris.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- It's literally just sleeping.
- You can't feel cold when you're asleep.
- You know what to do.
- Whoa!
- Crazy, buddy.
We got the job done.
- Where are we?
- Go take a nap.
- Okay.
I'll see you in a couple more hours.
We're gonna go film.
- Why would you do that?
- We are now on top of
a 1000 foot tall canyon.
- I'm terrified.
- And if you're crazy
enough to cross this canyon
on just that slack line,
I'll let you keep the 20
grand on the other side.
- I'm pretty nervous.
The wind keeps on picking
up and like slowing down.
My goal is to get to the end
of the line where that 20 K is.
- And my goal is for you not to fall.
- Let's freaking go.
- She is now descending onto it.
The 20 thousand's on the other side.
- Please don't fall.
- I'll try not to.
- Thank you.
- All right. She's doing it.
As long as she's not dangling
from the rope, she's still in.
- She's fearless.
- This is crazy.
And while she's crossing,
I'm gonna tell you guys
about experian, which is a free mobile app
that lets you take control
of your credit score.
I can't even focus on the
ad because this is so crazy.
- You got this, just focus.
- Take your time.
This app gives you access
to your credit score
and helps you improve it.
experian also has experian Boost.
So you can basically
leverage things like your
cell phone bills, your
utility bills, even things
like Hulu and Netflix to
build your credit score.
Do you know what your credit score is?
- No idea.
- Okay. Sorry. Don't worry about it.
Boost is only used on
your positive payment.
So if you have a late payment,
it won't hurt your FICO score.
- The money's right here.
- Oh my Lord.
- She is not looking.
She's so focused.
- This can obviously help you
qualify for affordable loans
that you can then use to buy
a car, a house or a yacht.
- Sup guys. How's it goin'?
- I'm just holding your prize.
- People on average using experian Boost
saw a 13 point increase
on their FICO score.
She's almost there.
Oh my goodness.
- Oh God.
- Oh my goodness.
- Woo. Oh, thanks guys.
That's one of the scariest
things I've ever had to do.
Thank you so much, Jimmy!
Download experian.
- Just click the link in the description
and download experian now.
And congratulations on 20 grand.
Meanwhile, Airrack's
been freezing for hours.
- Five. Not that anybody's counting.
I am so bored, but more than
that, I am horribly cold.
- How you doing in there?
She's starting to win
some pretty serious money.
- Yeah. That's the goal.
I'm gonna bankrupt you!
- That's scared me.
Somehow he was still going strong,
so we decided to crank up the difficulty.
Hey, see the timer?
It's paused until you give us your hoodie.
- What if I give you the hoodie
but you give her 10 grand?
- But shake on it.
I'll give her 10 grand for your hoodie.
- Okay.
- Oh my gosh. His hand's cold.
All right, bye.
Here's the thing.
We're not forcing you to stay in there.
- Are you bankrupt yet?
- No. I have tons of money.
- I'm staying.
I hate those guys.
- This is Marcus and in
front of us is 40 grand.
You have two options.
You can either steal this 40 grand
and keep it all to yourself or split it
with a random person you will never meet.
We also brought back this
guy that was stolen from
in a previous video.
- Wanna steal it then.
- The guy that lost out on 10 grand
is gonna be watching this.
- Wait, what?
- Let's see if his luck got better.
- What do you think he's gonna pick?
- Steal.
- You think he's gonna steal?
- Steal.
- You don't even wanna think on it?
- Not even thinking about it.
- Oh my God.
- What I tell you?
- Sorry bud.
- Oh man.
That's painful.
He's looking at the camera.
That is not good.
So messed up.
Yeah. Yeah.
He's taking a money bath.
He's swimming in it right now.
That's a good day he had.
- He's having a good day.
- I'm gonna go talk to the
guy who just lost 20 grand.
How's it going?
This guy was so much worse
than the girlfriend before.
- Didn't hesitate.
Right? He's taking pictures
right now with Chris.
Oh, you're forever gonna be here.
Are we just gonna keep going until someone
actually splits it?
And now we're inside the
alligator capital of the world.
And as you can see, there
are literally hundreds
of alligators all around this place.
And three can I borrow the camera?
Do you see those two
briefcases over there?
There's $20,000 in them.
If you go retrieve it, I'll
let you keep the money.
- Not doin' it.
I'm not doing it either.
I didn't even get to ask you.
I'm gonna be honest.
I knew the boys would say no
which is exactly why I brought Brian.
He spent his entire life handling animals
and I know he's gonna attempt it.
- Absolutely.
- Unlike Tareq.
- Tareq, you're a wimp.
- All right. So Brian,
I don't know if you see
but there's an alligator at your feet.
- He's just really
jumping in there with it.
- You just get out there
- Get back here, back to
back, back, back, back back.
You go away.
You go away.
Nice Jimmy, why am I doing this?
- The alligator didn't like that.
You should step lightly.
- This alligator right here's like,
""hey guys, can I be on camera?""
They want some screen time.
Only two more steps.
Congratulations, Brian,
on winning $20,000.
How are you gonna get off that island?
- I didn't think about that.
- Oh!
- I didn't either.
I'm gonna go to the next bit.
- I am so cold.
I've never been this
cold in my entire life.
Ugh, Eve I have nothing left.
I have to get out.
- It's okay, man.
- Buddy, you look a
little cold over there.
- I'm freezing.
- You just crossed another hour mark.
So here's another 10 grand.
- Do we feel good with 80 grand?
- Yes.
- Okay. We're done.
Oh boy.
Outta here.
Oh my gosh.
- Congratulations on winning this
80 grand in cash. Bring it in.
We're going to the hottest room.
- Stop. Stop.
You can't go from the coldest room
in the world to the
hottest room psychopath.
Most of the contestants you saw
in this video are random subscribers.
If you haven't already,
hit that subscribe button
because it could literally win you money."
3jS_yEK8qVI,"- [Jimmy] I built the world's
most dangerous escape room
and if this contestant can
finish it less than one hour,
he wins $100,000.
Level one is simple.
They must escape this room
before these spikes impale them.
I'm gonna head out.
- Wait, these are actually sharp.
- Too bad.
The walls are closing in.
(dramatic music)
- Oh God, there's sand.
- You gotta break out of the room.
Break the brick wall!
- Get the wall!
- [Chris] Get the tools!
- Get the wall!
- This is literally only level
one and they're struggling.
(dramatic music)
- [Nolan] Jesus, hurry!
(screaming)
- [Karl] Go!
Oh my God!
Are you kidding me?
- [Jimmy] And that was just the first
of 10 different levels.
They have to find the exit in every level
to reach the $100,000
before the timer hits zero.
Here's the thing, the
timer's still going down.
- So we need to get moving guys.
- [Jimmy] Yep.
(dramatic music)
- Wait, be careful, be
careful, be careful.
- Holy crap.
(Karl laughing)
- There's a key hidden somewhere
in this room, good luck.
(door slams)
- It's not on this clock.
(rock music)
The key might be up here.
(rock music)
- I should probably check
inside the light bulb.
(glass shatters)
It's not in the light bulb.
- Where is this thing?
- Gentlemen,
you guys see this $100,000 right here?
In exactly 55 minutes it's
gonna get dumped into this fire
if you don't take it
off this conveyor belt.
- Where do you put a key?
Where do you put a key?
- That's a Jimmy thing to
do is put it in the toaster.
It's not in the toaster.
- Where have we not looked?
- Give me a boost.
(dramatic music)
- Is there anything in there?
(upbeat music)
- He's standing on Akira's back.
- [Chris] Door's open.
Oh my God, it's Minecraft.
- [Jimmy] This is the Minecraft level.
I wonder if the exit has anything to do
with the TNT block in the wall.
- We need to light it.
- Do you actually think it'll blow up?
- One way to find out.
- I'm saving my checkpoint.
Yo, there's a cave.
- Oh my God.
There's a cave and fire.
- [Akira] There's a bow!
- I think I figured it out.
- If you've ever played Minecraft,
you know that a flaming
arrow lights a TNT block.
The second he shoots it, we need to run.
Just run right after you shoot it.
- Okay.
Three, two, one!
- He missed!
He literally missed.
- Three, two, one!
It's hard to aim with it.
Screw it.
- Wait, are you just gonna jam it?
Oh God!
- Go, go, go!
(yelling)
(explosion)
- [Chris] Jesus Jimmy.
Is the wall still there?
- [Akira] Yeah it's fine.
Let's go, go, go.
- [Jimmy] All right.
- Whoa.
- Ah, a goat, oh my goodness, hello!
- [Jimmy] Boys,
welcome to level four.
- Jimmy shut up, there's a goat.
- [Jimmy] Yeah, I know.
This level looks like they
need to dig out the key
in the middle but what they don't know
is the door's just unlocked
and they can actually leave whenever.
Let's see how long it takes
them to figure it out.
Akira are you just gonna give up
a hundred grand for a goat?
- No, no, no, no, no.
Looks like we're gonna have to
get this out with a pick ax.
- I think the goats have
something to do with it.
- Akira has lost over $2 million in videos
and you're not gonna help him?
- [Karl] I'll help him.
- [Jimmy] They wasted so much
time trying to dig out the key
that I decided to give them a hint.
Guys.
Just get the key out so
you can open the door.
- Wait.
- Grab the key
and open the door.
- [Akira] Hold on.
He said just open the door.
(dramatic music)
Guys it's open, come on, it's open!
- Welcome to my scale replica of a hotel.
We worked with Zach King
to design this trick hotel
with tons of rooms in secret hallways.
But Chris instantly cracked the code
by kicking down the fake brick wall.
- [Akira] Oh, there's a secret entrance.
- [Chris] Oh, is this it?
- Whoa, this is crazy.
- [Karl] What?
- [Akira] Whoa!
- [Chris] Oh my God.
- [Akira] There is a
lot of snakes in there.
- [Chris] Yeah, you think?
- [Akira] They're huge.
- [Jimmy] One of those
snakes is 18 feet long
and weighs 200 pounds.
- I'm gonna go through.
What? I think we need to stand on this.
Excuse me.
- [Akira] Did that open something?
(all responding)
- [Jimmy] Step off real quick.
Oh, it closed.
I think it's obvious what needs to happen.
- We leave Akira.
- One of you has to go
stand on the pressure plate.
- Wait, somebody's gotta stay behind.
Who's doing it, me or you?
- On shoot.
- One and done?
- One shoot, one and done.
- One and done or three?
Should we do three?
- Three.
- Three, okay.
Rock, paper,
- Go, you go, go, go, go.
- [Chris] I didn't lose!
Oh my God.
- Goodbye Chris.
- Wait, I don't get to come?
- Gentlemen, welcome to the next level.
Drop the chocolate.
(clattering)
- [Karl] Yeah, all right.
Why are the thousands of chocolate bars?
- One of these has a mystery
ticket on the outside
that will get you out of this room.
And while they're looking
for the mystery ticket,
I wanna tell you guys
about my new snack company, Feastables.
Which is launching with three flavors.
Original, Almond, and Crunch.
- Crunch is my favorite.
- My favorite's Almond.
- Oh, no, nevermind.
- They're made with only five ingredients
but still taste amazing.
This is our Crunch bar.
Tell me if you like it.
- Hmm, that's actually really good.
- [Jimmy] And I'm kicking off Feastables
with something I've always wanted to do.
10 random bars are gonna
have a mystery ticket
inside of them and if you
get this mystery ticket,
we will fly you out to compete
for a chocolate factory
in one of our videos.
And on top of that, Chandler,
we're giving away over a million dollars
in other prizes to random
people that buy the bars.
- Dude, I need to buy these.
- It was in here this whole time?
- Just go to feastables.com
or click the link in the description
and buy yourself some chocolate bars.
They're better for you
and they taste amazing.
- Go, go, go.
- We are now moving on to level 8.
This massive library has
over 1,000 books in it
but only one opens the trap door.
19 minutes remain.
- Okay, um.
- Time is ticking.
- Elon Musk.
I don't know anything about Elon Musk.
- Where is he looking?
He's looking over here.
- How do you know he's looking over there?
- What do you mean how do I know?
- The direction his eyes are pointing?
Akira, I'll give you a
hit if you let us burn
5,000 of the hundred grand.
- Burn it.
- You sure?
- Yes.
- Hey Chandler.
- Yeah?
- Burn five grand.
- Okay.
That looked like five grand, right?
- Now that that money's on fire,
I'm gonna point in a certain direction.
- Oh man.
Uh, Elon Musk, Elon Musk, uh.
I can't read.
- That's a problem. Maybe
you should send Karl up.
- Whoa!
Yo this one says Elon Musk!
- [Akira] Grab it!
- Yoo!
- You have less than 15 minutes
for a hundred, or 95 grand.
Run!
13 and a half minutes.
- [Akira] Okay.
- Akira, welcome to level nine.
You remember in an earlier level
where you had pickaxes and weapons?
- Goat.
- I have to go all the way back?
- You have less than 13 minutes.
(dramatic music)
- There's no time.
- If he does not touch this money
in the next 11 and a half
minutes, you dump it in that fire.
- Like this.
- Yeah.
Oh gosh, he actually burnt it.
(dramatic music)
(Akira groans)
- Okay. We got something, let's go.
(dramatic music)
(clock ticking)
(dramatic music)
- This is the final level.
So if you look over there,
you'll see the 90
something thousand dollars.
You have to make it across
without touching the lava.
Okay. You've only lost $2
million on this channel
in these videos.
- Yeah.
- I don't know where
I was going with this.
I just wanted to bring it up.
(clock ticking)
(dramatic music)
- Wait, wait, wait, how's your hamstring?
- It's fine.
- 'Cause it's already
cost you a ton of money.
(dramatic music)
- [Karl] Yeah you're fine, you're fine.
- I would tickle Akira,
but this is a lot more serious for him
because he actually gets the money.
- And I'm very ticklish.
- Okay. Now the final part.
- Ready.
(clock ticking)
- Hundred grand.
Think about.
Oh man, he's doing this pretty easy.
(dramatic music)
(clock ticking)
- [Karl] There's the fire right there.
- [Jimmy] Don't push it in the fire!
- Let's go!
- Congratulations.
- I did it!
- I'm passing.
He did it with two minutes remaining.
Obviously that's fake money
'cause it's illegal to burn real money but
- Oh!
- The real money is
right here in these bags.
If you're hungry, go to feastables.com
and order our brand new chocolate bars.
They taste amazing.
They're good for you.
And subscribe or I'll
punch you in the throat.
- Subscribe!
Let's go baby!
We did it!

00NgUctWoLQ,"(techno music)
- This is the largest stadium in the world
and inside are the 10
biggest creators on YouTube.
This is $1 million and
whichever one of them
I find last keeps it!
(crew cheers)
I'm gonna count to a hundred.
Go hide.
(crew cheers)
- See later, everybody.
Three.
- Okay, This is for a million dollars
- Six.
Hey, Mark, good luck!
- Thank you!
- [Jimmy] This stadium
can hold a hundred thousand people
and has a million places to hide.
- 51, 52.
Do I really have to count to a hundred?
- We need more time, Jimmy.
- Three, two, one.
$1 million for your fans.
Good luck.
In my previous video, I
invited a bunch of YouTubers
that had a bunch of crazy challenges.
The 10 people competing
here were the winners
of those challenges.
So let's go left.
- They are not finding me.
- I haven't run this much since P.E.
- [Boy] Okay.
(upbeat music)
- I'm gonna go that way.
You go that way.
- Okay
- I have the perfect hiding place.
- They give us no time to hide.
- We scaled up an eight-foot wall.
Jimmy, you can come find me.
- Come out, come out where you are.
- Trust me.
There's somebody over here.
I'm gonna find you.
Give it a rest.
(Jimmy knocking)
Do you smell that?
- If they're in here, they want it.
But this smells so bad.
- So am in a trash can right now.
Oh, my God.
This is disgusting.
Jimmy, I've been looking
for like a year, I think
and I still haven't found anybody.
- Why do I keep picking
giant places for this stuff?
We did three laps at the
stadium and found nothing.
I feel like this game could take forever
but sometimes you can get lucky.
Steps to the perfect hiding spot.
Pop open the top, climb in.
(dramatic music)
It is the perfect hiding spot.
Perfect.
And while Mat Pat was climbing
in a trashcan, we got him.
You're not some trash worker.
- No!
Trash worker.
- Yes, I found someone!
Attention, everybody!
Mat Pat is officially out!
- Look at my shame.
- No, not Mat!
- Dang it!
I was rooting for him.
- No joke, I was like 40 feet away
from the cleaner when you found me.
(Jimmy screams)
- I searched a hundred more
rooms and found nobody.
I literally have no idea
where they're hiding.
- Jimmy, there are cars in the building.
There may be somebody hiding in there.
- You're right.
Let's see if someone's in here.
- No way.
(dramatic sting)
I almost hit the door. (laughs)
- (hisses) I barricaded myself
in stacks of various beverages.
- My butt is wet right now.
I'm pretty sure I'm out
here sitting in throw up.
I'm gonna win this.
Mark my words.
(piano music)
- This is gonna take forever.
I'm really struggling to find them.
So I invited the five people
that lost in the last video
to help me seek.
The objective is simple.
We rip a million dollars
outta someone's hand.
- Yeah!
- I love the energy
- All five coming after us.
I'm scared.
- You check that cabinet.
I check this cabinet.
- One, two, three.
- I'm not leaving this place
until somebody gets found.
- Oh, I hear them.
- We gotta get to the first floor, guys.
- First floor, first floor.
Where else can we check that
we have not checked so far?
(dramatic music)
- It's very hot in here.
It's very dark.
- [Boy] I don't think
there's anybody in there.
- You don't think so.
- There's nobody in there.
- I'm feeling it.
- Wow!
- I would honestly say outside.
(dramatic music)
- Zach!
- [Girl] Oh, my God!
Oh, my!
- [Boy On Walkie Talkie] I found ZHC.
- Looks like we found somebody.
- I'm so sorry.
- No, I'm so sorry.
- Meet me at the field, pronto.
But before I could go on
the field to eliminate ZHC,
Carl and Nolan noticed
something interesting.
- What is this worker working on?
He's just moving the cart and forth.
- [Nolan] He's doing worker things.
- Just looked a little bit suspicious.
Jimmy, I found somebody.
But he doesn't know that I saw him.
- Who is it?
- So I'm hiding in this basket thing.
People won't think to check it
'cause it's like, ""Oh it's like a worker.""
Big brain move, baby.
(dramatic music)
- Carl kept guarding the
very suspicious cart.
Let's see if his hunch was right.
- How much are they paying
you to push them around?
- He gave me 500.
- I'll give you a thousand dollars.
(dramatic music)
We're gonna push him to the field.
- It's not fair.
I thought I had it.
You'll ever take me alive!
(guys laugh)
- And I brought you on the field
because that's where the prison is.
Follow me.
- Aww!
- Reason I caught on is
'cause he literally
just kept taking plastic
and then putting it back on the
cart and then taking it off.
Look, NPC.
- We found Mark, Rover and ZHC.
Only seven of you remain!
- Only seven more left.
(Logan breathes heavily)
- Maybe I do need my mom
right now because I am scared.
- And to celebrate
getting three people out,
we're officially shutting
off the sixth floor.
I'll give you like 10 minutes to move
if you're on that floor.
- Jimmy just told us to move floors.
I was super comfortable and that sucks.
- You want me down a floor.
(upbeat music)
(door creaks)
(Larray panting)
- You guys wanna subscribe (indistinct)?
Make sure you subscribe.
(soft music)
- Just to confirm,
you are all off the
sixth floor now, correct?
(walkie talkie buzzes)
- I think I found a great spot. (blowing)
I think I'm good.
- Shh!
- [Man] Shh!
- Shh!
- All right, so I'm gonna freeze.
- I really don't know how
much longer I can stay in here
because it smells so bad.
- I'm a bush.
- Even with Zach branching
out his hiding skills,
we were getting closer.
Well if this isn't a
suspicious room. (laughs)
Okay, if I were them I
would create a blockade
using these guys to distract away from...
(dramatic music)
Ah, the mop closet!
Darn it!
I thought for sure.
- There's so many to choose from.
(dramatic music)
(Logan laughs)
- Oh, my God, my allergies.
(Larray sneezes)
- Wait, go see who that was.
- Oh, my God.
- Despite not finding
anyone, Air Rac got lucky.
- I 100% just saw a
face in this trash can.
Okay, is this a person?
- [Jimmy] Oh, my gosh!
That is a real person.
- Oh!
- [Jimmy] Oh no.
You've been in this box
for like five hours.
- I thought it was worth it
'cause I'd win the money,
but now it's not worth it.
(Jimmy laughs)
- All right, everybody.
We officially have our fourth person out.
She was hiding in a trash can
just like Mat Pat.
I'd advise you stop hiding in trash cans.
They don't work.
Because of Mat Pat and Sofie,
I could never trust a trash can again.
No one.
Can I inspect these bags?
(upbeat music)
Okay.
You're good to do your job.
Because Rosanna's still in,
I even have to check things
like this little trashcan.
She could fit in anything.
Like if I were a tiny Rosanna
Pansino, where would I hide?
Boom!
If I were a tiny Rosanna
Pansino where would I...
Hide!
(dramatic sting)
Ah, I thought I had her for sure.
(upbeat music)
For sure!
(upbeat music)
It had been another two
hours since we found anyone
and I was tempted to make
the circle smaller again.
But right before I could do that,
I stumbled across one more person.
If I were to hide anywhere,
it would be this room.
Wait a minute.
Is that some sneakers I see right there?
I'm gonna guess it's Logan.
This feels like some Logan stuff.
Oh Bella, how long have you been here?
Sorry it didn't work out, Bella.
You didn't manage to win this
million dollars for your fans.
- I tried.
- I'm gonna go find more people.
Attention, five remaining contestants,
Bella has been found.
I'm shrinking the playing
field down to the first floor.
This is where things get serious.
- We're having to move floors.
Fine.
Okay, we're moving.
(rapid music)
(car engine humming)
- They've gotta be moving.
(rapid music)
Wait, what's that?
(guys speak indistinctly)
Wait, what's that?
Wave!
Point your camera!
(guys speak indistinctly)
Oh!
Oh, no!
Raz, you're not fooling
anyone with those big pants.
- I don't know what I'm
doing out here by myself.
(rapid music)
- Quackity!
(Quackity laughs)
We got him!
Yes!
(rapid music)
- I saw you walking through
the windows right there.
- [Quackity] You just robbed me
of a million dollars, man.
- Come on, don't say that, Quack.
(soft music)
Look at that million dollars.
Yeah, you can wave goodbye to it.
With seven people now eliminated,
we are down to the final three.
- Massive stadium, but there's
not a lot of spots to hide.
- I literally showed up
here at 6:00 in the morning
pushing through with zero sleep.
- We are going head to
head and hide and seek
for a million dollars
for one of your fans.
You guys are currently
hiding on the first row.
This shouldn't take that long.
This is gonna be intense.
We're coming for you.
- Good thing I'm on the first.
- I'm so sleepy.
(dramatic music)
- Oh, frig, that hurts.
(dramatic music)
So I am up here.
Okay, I feel good about this spot.
- With Zach, Larray and Logan
and only one floor left,
there's nowhere for them to hide forever.
We're able to scour
every inch of this place
including the trash cans.
It's just a matter of time.
The real race is who will we find first?
- I think I left a little trace though.
You can see these black dots I dropped.
I don't like that.
- It's freezing in this freezer.
Go figure
- [Jimmy] There's some spots in here.
- Again, I hear everybody coming.
- I think one of them's in the ceiling.
Weird insulation on the countertop here.
Weird giant hand print, U print.
- [Girl] You think people are here?
- Yeah, let's look.
(dramatic music)
- It's 32 degrees in this
fridge and I'm in shorts.
- [Girl] He's not here, Mat!
I feel like he might have
been, but he gone now.
- I'm like a hunter.
I'm a hunter sniffing the scent.
(dramatic music)
- This is ridiculous.
(dramatic music)
- [Logan] No one believed
me when I set the scenes.
(dramatic music)
- Oh, there he is.
- [Jimmy] Turns out the
freezer was too much for Logan
and we heard him get out
and we literally found him
one minute before Zach.
(upbeat music)
Ah, got him!
- No!
- Yes, yes!
I knew it!
I had your numbers on!
(Zach screaming)
Whoo!
He was in the ceiling!
But here's where gets interesting.
Does this mean Larray won?
(Larray exhales)
About that, Larray actually
fell asleep while hiding.
(Larry snores)
We searched the entire first
floor and kept calling him.
We genuinely thought
he was a hiding master,
but it turns out he was napping
on the second floor of the entire time.
- And I literally just woke up.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what's the rules.
- [Jamie] While dazed and confused,
we eventually found him
coming down to the first floor
- Here I am.
- It also shows that
part of the skill of this
is not falling asleep
which is actually kind of funny. (laughs)
And because Larray was
outside the playing field,
we unfortunately had to disqualify him,
(soft music)
which means by technicality,
but well earned,
there is a winner.
- Wait, say it again.
- [Jimmy] You won.
That's for real?
- [Jimmy] Yeah.
- Are you--
(audience cheers)
- This is the million dollars
you just won right here.
(audience cheers)
- We won!
- This is the winner up here,
game three!
- What are you gonna give this to?
I will do Mr. B Style Giveaways of course,
put it towards foster care
and filmmaking ventures--
- Aw!
- that I'm into for--
- What a nice guy.
Thank you for watching.

x9TQ6culXIA,"[MrBeast] This is $1,000,000
 and these are 15
 of the biggest Creators

 We have Logan Paul,
 Bella Poarch, ZHC,
 and so many others.
 They're gonna be competing
 in 10 huge challenges,
 and the winners
 of each challenge
 will move on to compete
 for $1,000,000.
And for our first challenge,
we have an Olympic sprinter.
Whichever one of you touches
him first moves on.
Go for it.
[woman] Oh, no!
[Logan] I'mma get you, baby.
Like I said before,
there's only 10 slots
in the next video
and there's 15 of them.
[Logan] Slow down now, brother!
[MrBeast] Whoever touches him
first gets the first slot.
Oh, my God, look at that.
[Logan] I'm gonna get you.
[MrBeast] Oh, oh!
[Logan] [indistinct]
Wow, that was quick.
I'm the fastest man
on the planet.
For the second challenge,
you pick who moves on.
-[man] Dang!
-[man] Oh.
We're banging these out.
[man] Wow.
[MrBeast] Oh, wow,
that was awesome.
These are the seats of winners,
you two claim
the first two,
I'm gonna move on.
-That was easy.
-Yeah.
[MrBeast]
 For the third challenge,
 we went and blindfolded
 everybody and we hid the money
 on the top floor
 of this $10 billion stadium.
And if you look down there,
they're all just standing there
in the middle
of the field confused.
You can all remove
your blindfold.
 The million dollars is hid
 somewhere in this stadium.
First one to touch it moves on.
-Go--
-Go! Go!
[ZHC] I don't see it
anywhere here.
Let's go to level four.
I wanna say six
because it has a star
next to it.
[Lexi] I'm on the third level.
Hello, million dollars?
[Quackity] It's got
to be on the main floor.
I don't think it went higher.
[Ryan] I just did a full circle
on the top floor.
Didn't find anything.
Look at all this.
So much to explore.
I'm going up. Let's go up.
[Ryan] We're six.
[Mark] Ah, the cameras are here.
That's got to mean something.
[Quackity]
There's a camera over here.
-Ah, so much running.
-[Quackity] Yeah.
-Yeah, there it is, yeah!
-[Mark] We found it.
[Quackity] Yeah!
I found the million dollars.
[woman] The money
 has been found.
-No.
-[groans]
I'm glad I woke up for this.
[MrBeast] Next I brought
 our remaining contestants
 and our three winners
 to the YouTube Theater,
 which is right beside
 the stadium.
This next challenge is trivia
and it's pretty simple.
I have one question,
what is the total subscriber
count of all 15 people
invited plus me?
I'm starting a 60-second timer.
Good luck.
I have seen everybody's channels
but I actually don't know
how many subscribers
-everybody has.
-I'm gonna take a wild guess
because I don't have
60 seconds to do this math.
It's called simple arithmetic.
Preston, what are you on?
Aren't you only 20?
-Close.
-Hey, Logan,
-how many do you have?
-Twenty-three.
-[MrBeast] Twenty-three.
-Stop asking.
I think he just hit 20, so.
I'm not telling anyone.
How many subs do you guys have?
-I have 8.2.
-I have 5.8.
Bella, what do you think
the number is?
I wouldn't know either.
I see Zach doing a lot of recon.
Zach's asking a lot
of people their sub count.
-Twenty seconds remain.
-What? What? What?
Don't distract me
right now, Chandler.
Here, you wanna see my answer?
Yeah, I wanna see your answer.
Wait, zero is behind
[indistinct]
[Mark] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm saying.
[MrBeast] Okay. Ten seconds.
Three, two, one.
All right.
Put your pens down.
The number is 233,042,520
-is everyone's subscribers, so.
-[man] Wow.
You guessed it, bro.
[MrBeast] No one was even close
 to ZHC's answer.
All right.
Congratulations, Zach.
[ZHC] Aye!
[MrBeast] Give it a kiss.
Now we have four of our ten
contestants already picked out.
For this next challenge,
we filled the entire stadiums
with cardboard cutouts
and mannequins of Karl,
but one of these
is actually Karl
and whoever touches
the Karl first moves on.
You can go.
-[MatPat] Great.
-[man] Okay.
-[MatPat] Find Karl!
-[woman] No!
[Airrack] Oh, my gosh.
This man's running.
This man's running.
Okay. I'm looking around.
I'm looking for any movement.
[Ryan] Karl! This is so freaky.
[Karl] There are so many Karls.
They can't find me.
Where's this man?
[Zach] I'm gonna find you, Karl.
He's upstairs.
Why are these mannequins
so realistic?
[MrBeast]
You're looking for Karl.
He's around 6-foot tall.
Jimmy said I'm 6-foot.
If I had to guess,
I have a feeling
Bella's gonna win this one.
Wait, no, that means
she was on the right track?
Okay.
I'm following Bella.
-[man] Nope.
-[Bella] Oh, my gosh.
[MrBeast] Hey,
that's just Chandler.
It's only a matter of time.
This is so nerve-wracking.
[Sofie] Oh, my God.
Oh, I got him.
Congratulations,
you found me.
I was almost gonna go back.
[Airrack] They're right there.
I was literally
on the right floor.
So far, we have half
of our 10 contestants
picked out.
And if I was one of you ten,
I would start
to get a little nervous.
Second half
is when I turn it on.
Airrack has not said a word
in a very long time.
-Leave me alone.
-He's getting pissed.
Are you even
in this competition?
-Have you done anything?
-I'm trying!
I'm trying!
We have custom-made dolls
of each one of you
that we're gonna load
into this cannon.
And if you look out there,
you'll see a giant target.
Whoever lands
closest to the middle, wins.
-Here is your custom-made doll.
-[laughing]
[all] Oh!
Don't move.
I think this is a good angle.
-[man] Wow!
-[man] Whoo-hoo!
That was actually not bad.
Who's next?
She's not tall enough
to see the scope.
So she's gonna stand on Mat.
This is called friendship.
[Rosanna] Whoo!
[Karl] Wait,
that's actually really close.
[MrBeast] Oh.
That might be the winner.
I'm not gonna lie.
-[man] Oh.
-[all] Oh!
All three shots
have made it on the target.
They're much better
at shooting dolls
than I thought.
You don't wanna go
too low or too high, right?
It's about
finding the sweet spot.
Look at him
explaining what he's about
to do even though
he's about to fail.
[MrBeast] Oh, okay.
-Oh, wow.
-[Chandler] Oh, aah.
This is the story
of every Creator Games.
[man] Okay. There it is.
There it is.
That's the worst shot yet.
This is my doll and he's going
right to the middle
of that target.
[man] Oh.
[Ryan] Oh! Yes!
-[Karl] Oh, my God.
-That's so close.
Wait, I actually don't know
who's in the lead now.
Everyone knows this is the most
accurate way of measuring.
She's a thumb and a pinky away.
You're a little bit more
than a thumb and a pinky away.
Rose, congratulations
on moving on!
And for this next competition,
these nine Creators are going
head to head in a talent show
with Dr. Phil as the judge.
Hey, guys.
The contestants keep asking me,
do you have any idea
what you'll judge on?
So if I throw up, bad.
If I don't, good.
Mr. Doctor, it's a pleasure
to meet you today.
-How are you?
-I'm better now
that I'm hanging out with you.
Let's see this talent.
I'm coming.
I'm coming.
I'm coming to you, Doctor.
Oh, look at him go.
[Airrack]
This is very dangerous.
All right. Come on.
[groans] My finger.
You got it, you got it.
You did it,
you did it, you did it.
[Airrack] I love you, Dr. Phil.
-Well...
-Did I win or...
-Well, we'll let you know.
-Up next is Lexi Rivera.
[crowd cheering]
That's all I've got.
What do you mean
that's all you got?
That's pretty damn impressive.
[MrBeast] As the talent show
 went on, it became clear
 that some contestants
 had more talent than others.
[piano music playing]
3.14.
[Dr. Phil] All right.
All right.
Uh, what do you call
a late night talk show host
who lost his balance?
Jimmy Fallin'.
That's just a normal
dollar bill, right?
Do some mark,
something I couldn't guess.
I've got a handkerchief here.
I want you to go ahead
and hold this.
-I've got it in there.
-Abracadabra?
Magic isn't real, Dr. Phil.
I'm gonna cut.
Is that your dollar, Dr. Phil?
That is my drawing
on the dollar.
Knife drop.
[MrBeast] And now that they've
 all performed their talents,
 it's time for Dr. Phil
 to pick his favorite.
It comes down, I think, to...
I got to give it to Mark.
[cheering]
Congratulations, Mark.
You're moving on.
And we're heading
to the next challenge.
 There are eight contestants
 left but only three slots
 in our next video.
 The funny games are over.
 This is where things
 get serious.
Chandler,
reveal what's under that.
Whoever flushes the toilet
and comes back here first, wins.
[indistinct chatter]
[Preston screaming]
Holy frick, they are so fast.
Did he say
the entire freaking stadium?
I don't think they realized
that they could
have just flushed this toilet.
[Zach] I'm gonna head upstairs.
[Airrack] I mean,
the further I go,
the better chance I'll have.
What kind of a challenge
is this?
I see Ryan over there.
I hope they're having fun though
looking for, you know, a toilet.
Probably not.
[Ryan] No.
[Preston] Wait.
-[Zach] Yes!
-[toilet bowl flushing]
[Ryan] Done. Whoo!
[Preston] Flush!
Let's go.
I think I got it.
-[Airrack] No!
-[Zach] Whoo-hoo!
I can't believe it.
Oh.
Congratulations, Zach,
you're the best
at finding a bathroom
and flushing a toilet.
And now only two of you
are moving on.
For this next challenge,
we have seven bowling lanes
each with one hundred pins.
Whoever knocks down
the most pins moves on.
And this first lane
has MatPat's face on it.
So you're going first.
Bowling is kind of a religion
in my extended family.
-It doesn't matter, just bowl.
-Great.
[MrBeast] Okay. It's off.
-[MatPat] Oh.
-[MrBeast] Let's see it.
Oh, that was right on.
[MatPat] Whoa, keep going,
keep going, keep going!
Whoo! I'll take it.
You knocked out 86 pins.
I don't know if that's gonna be
strong enough to win.
I suck at bowling.
[MrBeast] Bowl-a Poarch.
Oh, in the side.
[woman] Whoo!
Whoo, whoo, whoo!
[MrBeast] Oh, wait.
Whoa!
[MatPat] What?
Are you kidding me?
She only knocked down 84.
Mat is still in the lead.
-[woman] Oh.
-Oh, I was close.
Just lock down the pins, yeah.
Keep going, keep going!
No!
-[Ryan] No!
-[man] Okay. Wait, wait.
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!
No!
Hey, Lexi,
I've been there before.
Oh, these, like,
get me nervous.
Preston, you've lost
a bunch of challenges.
Is he better than MatPat?
Let's find out.
It doesn't look like he is.
[Preston] Whoa, oh.
[MrBeast] No,
I'm not even gonna count it.
The only person standing
between you and competing
for a million dollars
is this man.
Brothers to the end.
-[Airrack] Ah.
-[MatPat] Sike!
[all] Oh!
[MrBeast] Airrack versus MatPat.
That's a good one.
Oh, it's close,
it's close, it's close.
[MrBeast] I'm gonna
give a precise count.
-Come on, come on, come on.
-[MrBeast] Thirteen, fourteen,
fifteen, sixteen, seventeen,
MatPat did in fact win.
[MatPat] Yeah!
I'm devastated.
He's moving on and we're moving
on the next challenge.
And now it's time
for the final challenge
to figure out
which one of you joins
the $1,000,000 game
of hide and seek.
I'm giving my fans 10 minutes
to vote on which one
of you they think
should move on.
I'm gonna put out
a YouTube community post

how you want.

come on, come on, come on.
Okay, share with your audience.
Okay, please vote for me.
How do I win this?
How do I win this?
-How do I win this?

Bella Poarch is in the lead.
[Preston] Wait,

-You're in third.
-Whoa!
[MrBeast] Bella,

 36% of the vote.
I, like, posted

my Story, and my Twitter.
Preston, you're the only one
that stands
a chance against Bella.
I'm trying.
How do you copy the link?
[MrBeast] Three
 minutes remaining,
 Bella is still in the lead.
Philippines is awake.
I posted so much.
[MrBeast] Preston

QbJJwaVdgIs,"- That helicopter is
carrying a military squad,
and it's gonna land right over there.
(explosion booms)
If that squad successfully
hunts me down before the end of the day,
they get this hundred grand.
Run, run, run.
Get in, get in.
- Go, go, go.
- Oh, they're running after us.
They are right on our tail,
we gotta get outta here.
I purposely put their car further away
so I can get a head start.
- [Sean] Get in the vehicle, let's go!
Come on.
(intense instrumental music)
- Right now he's not too far away.
He's right on the other side
of these trees it looks like.
- All right, we gotta be quick.
Okay, we're crossing the bridge.
Hey Chandler?
- Yeah?
- You know what to do.
- I got you.
(engine rumbling)
I've been waiting for this.
- So I've done this in the past
where I ran away from a
bounty hunter, and the FBI,
but I've never ran away
from three different people.
(intense instrumental music)
(explosion booming)
- I think Jimmy can get away now.
- We're like a mile down
the road and I heard that.
- Ooh.
- Oh.
- Yeah, you might have to go another way.
- The quickest way out of
that field is this bridge
that we just blew up.
(explosion booming)
So now they have to take the long way out,
and that should give me like a
five to 10 minute head start.
I rented an entire museum,
have dozens of cars,
giant military equipment,
and so much other cool stuff.
This is just the beginning.
- He's heading up, back up like northwest.
- This is where things get fun.
As you see the Squid Game mask over there,
we're in the right place.
- What?
Who is this guy?
- Now we are in a warehouse full of jeeps.
Let's just say when they pull up,
they're gonna be very confused.
Do you know what to do when they get here?
- No.
- No.
- [Jimmy] Just drive
in a random direction.
- Right now?
- No, when they get here.
- Oh.
- And now we patiently wait
and monitor the security cam.
- Looks like he's stopped at a building.
- [Cameraman 2] What's the
strategy? Wait, is that a knife?
- Yeah.
- Is this the spot boys?
- Yeah, this is the spot.
(intense instrumental music)
- We've spotted the military
squad on the security cameras.
All the doors on this building are locked.
Let's see if they break
into the warehouse.
- I'm gonna stay out front,
just in case somebody decides
to run out the front door.
- We're gonna check out the backside,
see if there's a vehicle back here.
- So one of them is
waiting at the front door,
and two of them are in the back.
We're just gonna patiently wait.
- The tracker is still in the building.
- [Zach] We got some glass doors
we can break up front here.
- All right, sounds good.
I'm gonna grab this to
go break some windows.
- There are fresh tire
tracks leading in as well.
- Jim's going to get the vehicle,
I'm gonna go ahead and break in.
- [Sean] All right, go
(glass shattering)
- [Voice On Radio] Military
has breached the building.
It's time to go.
- I should probably recline,
so its harder to see me.
I'm gonna hide under this blanket,
so they can't see me in this car.
Lock your doors.
- Go, go, go, now!
- Zach, let's roll back to the Hummer.
(intense instrumental music)
(engine noise drown out speaker)
- [Jim] Which one? Which one?
- [Cameraman] That should
be them, right there.
- [Jimmy] Do they notice me?
- [Cameraman] We drove
right past each other.
(intense instrumental music)
- We made it out with all the other teams.
Oh my gosh!
Dude, they didn't even know how to react.
- He's on the move again.
He's straight ahead due south.
- This is the tracker that
is telling the military squad
where I am at all times.
And if I put the tracker
inside of this special bag,
it jams it.
And now they don't know where I am.
- It looks like the
vehicle may have stopped.
- I don't see Jimmy.
I think he's messing with us.
- All right, so hold on. It just updated.
He's straight north again.
(Sean cheering)
(upbeat instrumental music)
- And now we're in the middle of nowhere.
There's literally nothing out here,
except this old barn
that I had constructed.
- Whoa.
- Mind if I set
my hundred grand right here?
Bad news.
There's only two seats inside of here.
(Jimmy groans)
- I think I see them.
(duck quacks)
- Coming up on the tracker.
- Holy cow, here they come!
- Check the car, and take the top.
- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
- Hey, hey, hey, look, look.
There he is. There he is.
- Brace yourself.
(wood splintering)
(intense instrumental music)
- [Jim] Get in, get in.
- [Sean] Let's go.
- Oh my god!
- Run away! Don't stop!
Go!
- Hey guys! Guys!
Hey, I'd like to join your guys team,
what do you think?
- Get in.
- You think?
(Karl laughs)
- [Cameraman 2] That's not funny.
- Saved Jimmy some time.
Hopefully that's enough.
- Go, go, go, go, go.
- All right boys, here we go.
Let's go.
- It's this as quick as she goes?
- Full speed.
- There he is. There he is.
We're coming for you Jimmy.
- Oh my God! They're catching up!
Go!
(intense instrumental music)
- [Cameraman] This is scary man!
- We're coming up on the rocks.
(squad laughs)
- We got you!
- According to our calculations,
their cars shouldn't be
able to go over these rocks.
All right.
- Here we go!
- Go, go, go, go.
Just go.
(truck engine rumbling)
(cameraman laughs)
- [Cameraman] Later nerds!
- Let's go, yeah we can go.
Just go.
(intense instrumental music)
- Oh no!
(cameraman yelling)
- Clear.
Boys let's go.
- Wait!
They weren't supposed to go over the rock!
- I don't think he thought
we were gonna do that.
- Oh no! I'm screwed!
The plan was to get in
those porta potties,
but then the rocks didn't work.
Just go!
(intense instrumental music)
- [Zach] And what's the plan?
Let's think of a plan.
- The plan is
we're gonna catch him.
(squad laughing)
- [Zach] That's it. That's it.
(intense instrumental music)
- Send the helicopter.
Go, go, go.
(intense instrumental music)
- [Cameraman 2] You heard Jimmy?
- Hurry up, he's in there.
He's in the truck.
- Get me out of this
and I'll give you ten grand.
- We're coming for you.
- That's a badass truck.
- Yeah it is! (Sean laughs)
They can't go very fast though.
(engine roaring)
- All right, we've got a proposition.
You double the money to 200K,
we'll give you 10 minutes from right now.
- What about 150?
- 150, deal?
Pull over Jim.
- Can we get
a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup Blizzard?
- Do know who Mr. Beast is?
- Yeah, I do.
- We're actually chasing him
right now, so we're gonna
need these pretty quick.
We just gave Jimmy a 10 minute head start.
We already decided we're
gonna donate the money anyway.
We know we can help out
a lot of people with it.
- And while the military got ice cream,
we buried Nolan alive so that
they would think he was me.
(slow instrumental music)
Nolan?
- Yeah.
- Are you ready? I'm about
to drop my tracker down.
I dropped it. Did you get it?
- No.
- Good cause I didn't drop it,
but I just did.
(Nolan groans)
- [Nolan] Ow, it hit my face
- Act like your me, I'm gonna go hide.
Me and Chris are hiding in the woods,
let's see what happens.
Do you think they'll see us here?
I swear to god if we lose a 150
grand cause of your hiccups,
I'm gonna kill you.
(Chris hiccups)
- I can't help it, I can't get rid of-
- Can you just go walk down
and see if you find them?
- Yeah, sure.
It's very dark and spooky out here.
Couple of, oh...
You guys aren't very good
at being military people.
Oh god! Don't tackle me.
(Chris screams)
- I just heard Chris screaming.
I'm gonna call him.
- [Chris] Jimmy they got me.
- Did you see that video
where I buried myself alive?
- We've done a lot of
reconnaissance on you my friend.
- I can tell.
This whole video you've been
screwing up all my plans.
It's annoying.
I'm currently buried alive.
Good luck.
(phone beeps)
I hung up on them.
That was a complete lie,
let's see if they fall for it.
- So right now he's still
supposed to be buried in here,
so we'll see.
(phone rings)
- [Karl] Hello?
- Karl, they're almost here.
You go investigate, report back.
- Okay.
- Hurry.
(phone beeps)
These guys are good.
I'm terrified.
- Hello?
- [Jimmy] Who was it?
- Are these my Marine friends
that are right in front of my car?
- Is it a Hummer?
Wait Karl who is it?
- That are right
in front of my car.
(engine rumbling)
- Karl, is it them?
- Hey, what's up?
- Karl, is it them?
Karl, is it them?
Karl! Karl!
- Wait before you go,
wait, wait, wait, wait. Oh,
you're driving away right now,
and he is driving through
the path right now.
- They blocked off our exit route.
I have no idea what they are,
I'm just laying in the woods.
- Jimmy?
- Yeah?
- Earlier today, before we
jumped on the helicopter,
who'd you talk to?
- I don't remember, that
was a long time ago.
- Was it FaceTime or phone call?
- FaceTime.
(Sean grunting)
- Not him.
- You couldn't have been
like, ""I don't remember,
I'm Jimmy, I'm famous.""
- I have the tracker.
You can't find Jimmy without me.
- Fair enough.
- You literally have to dig me up.
- You guys have to dig
up Nolan of all people.
- Hello?
- Let me know if he comes down this path.
- He's passing my car right now,
you gotta go somewhere.
- [Jimmy] Yo, yo, yo.
He literally just walked
right past me, oh my gosh!
- [Karl] Just move it that way.
- I can't believe he
literally walked past me.
I've been laying down
on the side of the path.
(intense instrumental music)
- If you come to me right now, we're fine.
I moved their Humvee, so
it's not blocking us anymore.
- So the coast is clear Karl?
- Yes.
- Okay, I'm coming.
I'm trusting you.
- Okay.
I don't actually know if it is.
(intense instrumental music)
Close the door, oh my God!
- Just get us outta here.
Go, go, go.
Oh my God, I can't believe we got away!
We're currently driving
to the final location.
I literally rented an entire museum.
Two hours until midnight,
$150,000 on the line,
let's do this.
(Karl cheers)
- Hey Nolan, just letting you know
they're contemplating breaking the glass.
- [Nolan] Oh don't...
No seriously, I'll die.
- If you tell me the information
that we need to know to keep moving,
I'll get the Bobcat,
and we'll dig you out
a hundred times faster
than Jim and I can dig
you out with shovels.
Deal?
- Deal.
The North Carolina Museum
of Natural Sciences.
- I'm just letting you know,
they're not getting the
backhoe, they're leaving.
- No.
- All right,
we'll see you later Nolan, bye
- Are they lying?
Chris!
- And now we are finally at the museum.
- Let's spend a night here.
- There's literally
multiple different floors
to this museum,
and I could hide anywhere I want.
Now I'm gonna sit in
this corner right here,
and I'm gonna cover up
my back with this jacket.
(Karl grunting)
Now I'm hidden below this makeshift rock.
Cut the lights.
- Oh.
I'm gonna go meet with them,
and try to get them to
go other directions.
- [Jimmy] Okay, have fun.
(Humvee door slams)
- All right.
- Exactly an hour left to find Mr. Beast.
- The military guys are calling me.
Hello?
- Hello?
- I promise you I will
not leave this museum.
I am in here somewhere.
Goodbye.
(phone beeps)
Why is it so much fun
to hang up on people?
- Hi guys.
- Hey.
- What are you guys looking for?
- [Jim] Ignore him, he's the enemy.
- I'd check the theater.
- I'd check the theater.
- No.
- Yeah, he's not allowed
in there.
(all laughing)
Yes, he's probably this way.
- Ah, nope. That means no.
Jimmy come out.
Do you know where Jimmy is?
- Yes I do,
and of course I'll tell you.
- Okay, where is he?
(Sean groans)
Jimmy.
All right, nothing.
- Hello?
- Did you by chance
go across any bridges?
- Lots of bridges,
especially the bridge I
blew up at start the video.
(Jimmy cheers)
- Oh!
(Karl laughs)
We got 45 minutes.
- Jimmy.
We know you're here.
(suspenseful music)
- Oh no.
What gave it away?
- Your shoes.
- Wait, really?
He's taking a picture
(camera snapping)
for his son.
All right, get this
stupid rock off my head.
You guys just won a 150 grand.
(squad cheering)
What are you
gonna spend it on?
- We're gonna donate it to
the HunterSeven Foundation.
The HunterSeven Foundation does research
on toxic exposures for veterans
from the last couple wars.
- By the way, your friend
Nolan, he's still in the ground.

If they move right now, they're out.
They have to hold this position

And I can take all the time I want,

This guy's doing a full squat.

Oh they all stopped.
Red light.

You're still moving.
She was jogging over here.
We're gonna go see who's in the very back.
You are in dead last.
What's going on?

- You literally haven't even moved.
- Well, a couple steps.
- We'll see if it pans out, green light.
Yellow, red light.
Oh, that we got her,
the yellow light worked.

throw a yellow light out there.
- Since 067 was a big part of the show.
I'll let you say green light.

funny if she just got out.
As you can see, over 100
people have been eliminated.
Do the honors, Chandler.

shape, they're eliminated.
All right, so everybody
I'm gonna need you to get
in the line in front
of one of these question marks.
(tense music)
Why did you pick this one?
- Just like, the middle.
- Basically you don't think it's umbrella.
- There's an umbrella?
- Did you even watch Squid Game?
- So many of these people
are about to get out.
- Reveal shape number one.
(contestants cheering)
- Reveal the second symbol.
(contestants cheering)
Look at how hype they're getting.
If I was you, I'd be
getting pretty nervous.
Reveal it!
(contestants cheering)
Chris, go for it.
- No!
- I know umbrella going home.
That's all I got to say.
- We got the circle. Thank God
we didn't get the umbrella.
(tense music)
- You look pretty nervous over here.
Even though you got the star,
you're the main character.
so you have plot armor, you're fine.
Start the timer.
The challenge is underway.
You just hear them all scraping.
- I hate my life.
- I was taking it out of the tin,
and it just snapped in half.
- Lets see it.
- It's working.
(clock ticking)
- Take your time.
- You had an umbrella?
- Yeah.
- Sorry bud.
- Look at this. We have
a successful triangle.
Congratulations.
- Thank you.
- Oh no.
- What Jimmy doesn't know
is I brought a lighter,
and I'm gonna drop it for somebody.
- What, what, what?
- One and a half minutes remaining.
(Yoshi licking sounds)
- Let's get it, baby.
Yeah, yeah.
- Oh my gosh, this is the first
perfect umbrella I've seen.
- Oh yeah, easy peasy.
- Whoo!
- Six, seven, okay, she passed.
She does have plot armor.
- [Woman] Almost there.
- So close, 30 seconds.
- Oh my God.
- Are you serious?
- Three, two, one.
Time is up.
- You did it?
You did the umbrella?
- And just like that,
all these players have been eliminated.
But don't worry because
they're all walking away
with $2,000 in cash.
142 of you survived honeycomb.
(crowd cheering)
And if you leave in the next five minutes,
I'll give you $4,000.
Let's weed out some of the weak people.
$4,000.
- Thank you.
- I was not expecting this many people.
There we go, head on out.
And with that,
I'm gonna need you all to
split up into groups of 10.
We had them form teams
because next up is tug of war.
- This could determine your chance
at half a million dollars.
- We needed the strongest
people and the smartest people.
We have intelligence, skill, and brawn.
- We trying to recruit the biggest people,
so we can get real
strong and pull the rope.
- Sorry, no girls allowed.
- Oh, no girls allowed, boo, okay.
- I just sent three people off.
We got 10 now let's go.
- Let's go!
- I should have taken the four grand.
- We now have 12 different
groups of 10 people.
Let's move on to the next game.
And now let's decide who faces who?
(contestants cheering)
Okay, we're gonna draw one from here.
Six, we'll just draw this one.
Five, okay.
Follow me to the bridge.
And now the moment
you've been waiting for.
A game of tug of war.
Team six versus team five.
- Team five on three.
One two, three, team five.
- You've fall in the
foam, or your flag crosses
to the other team's
side. You're eliminated.
Are you guys ready?
- [All] Yeah!
- Are you ready?
- [All] Yeah!
- All right, three, skip a few, go.
- Pull!
- Power!
- Oh, it's going to team five right now.
Team six is falling.
Somebody's right at the edge.
Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig.
(crowd cheering)
- Congratulations, team five,
you have all moved on.
Team number two versus team number seven.
(team cheering)
They seem happy.
Team seven and two head on out.
- You keep me alive,
we're gonna get the money.
(team cheering)
- Give it up, this team's winning.
- Go, oh, it's already on right side.
Hey, let's check in on 067.
In the show you won,
so let's see if it works here.
And Karl, we have 067.
You should just lose.
- Karl no, give them motivation.
- Pull!
- Its over here, it crossed.
(team cheering)
Sir, can you come over here?
Why don't you draw?
Don't look, grab one from
here, and one from here,
and then grab one from here.
Team number four versus team number 10.
(team cheering)
If I was you guys, I'd be terrified,
'cause they have 456.
He's literally the main character.
- Let's go!
- Three, two, one, go.
Oh, they're getting, oh.
Oh, it's going over to 456.
They're falling.
They're dropping
They all just fell.
Obviously we have no way of rigging it,
but 456 and 067 both survived tug of war.
Let's draw, oh boy.
Nine versus 11.
(crowd cheering)
In this game with team
nine versus team eleven,
they went so hard that this happened.
They are going all out, look at them.
Oh they're falling.
Don't let them.
Oh yes.
Oh, they broke the set.
They literally broke it.
You guys can move on.
Go ahead and head on now.
Tug of war took us from
120 people down to 60.
And remember, only one of
these people is walking away
with $456,000.
All right, everybody.
Can we have your attention?
As you guys know from Squid Games,
game number four is marbles.
(contestants cheering)
- I don't know if I'd be cheering,
because instead of letting
you pick your partner,
we're gonna make you partner
with your best friend.
Throughout this entire challenge,
we've been monitoring who
you've been talking to the most,
and we're gonna make you
partner up with them.
And only one of you can move on.
For example, 067 and 431.
- That's my best friend.
- According to this, you two
are roommates and best friends.
We did our research.
- I have to come home
to the house we live in
at the end of the day,
gonna be a bit awkward.
- Wouldn't be able to
do it without you, man.
- We couldn't have done
it without each other.
- I'm glad I'm with you at the end.
- [Mr. Beast] Everybody
gets a bag of 10 marbles,
and they have to agree
on a game to play it
against their best friend.
20 marbles lets them move on.
But by winning, they
eliminate their best friend.
Go ahead and start the timer.
You can play whatever game you want,
but you need 20 to leave.
A lot of pairs went with marble games
that were played in Squid Game.
- Odd.
- Even.
- Odd or even?
- Even on that side.
- What?
What game are you playing?
- We don't know.
One marble at a time,
it's gonna take all day.
- If you keep talking, it might.
- Okay.
- [Mr. Beast] And other
groups got creative.
- What is this game?
- We're throwing it at the bricks, right?
If you get the middle one
right there, that's one point.
But if you hit the bricks in the behind,
then its three points.
Everything else is no points
until the clock runs down,
Whoever has most points is the winner.
- All right, well good
luck with your game.
- But one group just
wanted to get it over with.
You're doing even odds for all of it.
Yo, he looks so intense.
- He's got one marble.
- Are you sure?
- Oh, he got it, oh my gosh.
Congratulations on winning.
I'll see you in the next round.
- You're good buddy, you're good, okay?
- I'm so sad.
- Why are you sad?
It's gonna be okay.
- We promised each other we were not gonna
screw each other over.
I didn't even know we
were gonna be this close.
- I'm doing this for my
family, but I'm nervous.
- Best man's gonna win.
- Best man win man.
- Best man's gonna win.
- [Mr. Beast] Everybody,
you've got five minutes left.
- Don't look at me.
- They want to put
$465,000 Up to a coin flip.
- You had to make it sound like that, huh?
Tails.
- It's tails.
- Yo, oh no.
- Odd?
- I'll give you the honor of
eliminating your best friend.
- Oh no, that's even worse.
- Ah.
- Aww.
- It doesn't hurt.
Before I eliminate you,
I wanna let the viewers
know that someone random
that subscribes in the next
seven days is getting $10,000.
So if you haven't already,
hit the subscribe button okay?
- Can I do it?
- Go for it. Just hit right there.
- Oh.
- Don't fall, they're so dramatic.
So if you haven't already subscribe
and you could win 10 grand.
What game are we playing?
- Closest to the wall.
- A minute and 15 seconds remain.
When that hits zero, if you're in here,
you're eliminated.
- I have one more question to ask.
- What's up, man?
- You promise to remember me?
- Oh my gosh.
- What do you mean?
- You're literally both
about to get eliminated.
Oh, what was that?
- Why'd you do that?
- You sure?
- Yeah.
- He has been eliminated, thank you, sir.
- I love you, man.
- The time has hit zero.
Everyone in here is eliminated.
Congratulations on surviving marbles.
At this point in the real show,
there was an all out
brawl to thin the numbers.
So instead we're gonna play Ddakji.
You have to use this blue piece of paper
to flip that red one on
the ground by throwing it.
The first 16 of you to
flip your red square
moves on to glass bridge,
which is personally my favorite game.
Everyone throw.
Oh wow, we didn't even get anyone.
And while they're
fighting for their chance
in this competition, I wanna tell you guys
about Brawl Stars,
who helped fund this video,
which cost over three and
a half million dollars.
Thank you so much.
Throw.
- Yes!
- Brawl Stars is a mobile
game you can play at home,
on the go, in this
arena, wherever you want
against millions of
people across the world.
Oh, we got some.
Congratulations.
It's three minutes of
adrenaline filled mayhem,
and they have 12 different game modes,
including their own battle Royale,
which is kind of similar
to what we're doing here.
- Yes!
- Yes!
- Yeah, let's go.
- We have nine winners so far,
which means only seven places remain.
You said you played Brawl Stars?
- We both do.
- Oh, you both play Brawl Stars?
What are your thoughts on Brawl Stars?
- That it's pretty fun.
It's a mobile game, you can
download it on Android or Apple.
- I didn't tell him to say this.
- Lets go!
- Yeah!
- Yo, the main characters survived.
As you can see,
you see the Brawl Stars logo, he did it.
They have over 50 different
characters you can play as,
from a vintage driven robot
to a cactus named spike,
that kind of looks like Nolan.
- Hey.
- And like all our
contestants here are leaving
with $2,000 for free today.
Every single person that plays Brawl Stars
within the next seven days,
I will personally be
giving you a free prize.
So if you haven't already, go download it.
If you yell ""Thank you, Brawl Stars.""
Before you throw, I hear you'll flip it.
- [Contestants] Thank you Brawl Stars!
- Oh, it worked for him.
- Oh my God, it's true.
- Thank you, Brawl Stars.
- And for the 14 of you
that didn't flip it,
I'm gonna have to eliminate you.
Oh, that was so in sync, oh my gosh.
Now can all of you winners turn around.
Thank you, and now you
can turn around again.
We just filled the room with
16 different mannequins,
and here's the thing.
They're actually in a random order.
And the numbers on them are in Korean.
And the number they get here
is what order they have
to cross in glass bridge.
In a timely and orderly
fashion. You can all go.
First come, first serve.
What'd you get?
Oh, she got one.
Oh.
- 15, okay.
- All right, if you wanna
just go ahead and leave now.
Everyone has a vest with numbers,
let's go to glass bridge.
We are now at the glass bridge set,
and look at how insane this thing looks.
It is amazing.
And bring out the contestants.
I can't wait to see the
look on their faces.
- [Contestant] Oh, what?
Oh my God.
- Players, welcome to glass bridge.
(contestants cheering)
There is two platforms you can jump on.
One will drop you, and one will hold you.
Start the timer.
Begin the challenge.
- Okay.
- Let's go, girl.
- I'm sticking with the
guys I'm sticking with.
I'm sticking, I'm sticking.
- All right, she survived the first jump.
Okay, they are one for one so far.
- Go right?
- I'm always right.
- Okay.
- I don't know if I'd listen to Chris.
- Chris, this is on you.
- Hey, victory.
- We had our first loss.
If you're wondering where
she just fell, don't worry,
there's a giant foam pit
down there, she's fine.
Well now, now you know.
Now you know left.
- Come on, 13 Minutes guys.
- We now have three
people on the platform.
Only one out so far.
- I'm not moving.
I want somebody past eight
to take the next step.
- Past eight?
All right, I love that, yo.
- Hey. Three minutes has gone by.
- Is anybody willing to go?
Clock's ticking.
- [Mr. Beast] All right, let's see it.
(tense music)
- Come on, man.
You got this.
- Come on, Ted.
- Yes.
- Now go two.
Now you go.
- Come on two, you got this.
- I'll take the next one.
- All right, bro.
- Come on four, five, let's go.
- Let's go.
- Lets go, two.
Let's go, two.
Oh, you already knew that one.
- Oh, oh.
- Oh.
- You see how many I've gotten?
Take the next one.
- How many did you guess right?
- Three.
- Three?
- Yeah.
- Wow.
Yeah, honestly it's time
someone else steps up.
- Hey every second
somebody doesn't step up,
that's less time you got.
- Hey, if no one crosses,
I just keep the money.
- All right, three went for it.
- Three just got eliminated.
All right, two, he took the L for you.
- Adio time two.
- Hey honestly, hey two,
if you're three for three,
you might as well keep going.
Clearly, you're lucky.
- Oh my God, all right.
- [Mr. Beast] No pushing,
obviously, please.
- Come on.
- Two bit the bullet.
- Two's gone.
- Under eight minutes.
You've still got a ton of ground to cover.
- Yeah, he's good.
- I don't understand why number 10 went
in front of everyone.
That was dumb.
- Come on buddy.
- Yo did 10 make it again?
- All right, it looks like
number four is gonna go.
- Six minutes remaining.
- I'm doing this for the girls.
- Let's salute all the fallen people.
All right, continue.
Under five minutes left.
Tons of jumps.
This is gonna get intense.
- Oh, that was crazy.
- No ten's gone, no.
- [Mr. Beast] Another one gone.
- All right, don't move bud, don't move.
- I'm not moving.
- Your odds don't look
back there right now.
- Nah, I'm not moving.
I'm not moving.
- All right, just like
we thought would happen,
They're refusing to move.
Let's see who budges.
- I'm pretty good where I am.
- Lets go.
- You got it.
- Oh, he got it.
- All right, no, not a chance, come on.
- When are y'all big
numbers taking a chance?
- Under three minutes
with four jumps left.
- Somebody's gonna have to do it.
Y'all are in a real bad spot.
I'm not moving.
- What are y'all big numbers
taking a leap of faith?
- Hey, how are you doing back there, 15?
- Whatever, man, we could all lose.
- You guys better hurry up.
- They have two minutes,
why are they not rushing?
- If you go, I'll take the next one.
- All right.
- Come on.
- You jumping?
- Y'all really got me scared,
but hold up bro.
This is a real life decision.
- 90 seconds, one and a half minutes.
- Come on now, come on, come on, come on.
- Six.
- Jump, jump, jump.
Oh, you passed.
- I ain't moving, I am not moving.
Y'all, there's a God
telling me I'm not moving.
- One minute remaining.
Three jumps, one minute.
Hey, you guys in the back,
if you're not here when
it hits zero, you're gone.
- I took my leap of faith,
now I'm gonna stay right here and be cozy.
- Hurry, go.
- Y'all go.
- [Mr. Beast] It's just three.
(All clamoring)
- Take a leap of faith, come on, come on.
- You're up.
- I can't jump, they're in my way.
They're in my way.
- They're all crowded on that one.
- Hey, 30 seconds.
- Go, go.
- Go, take a leap of faith.
Go, go, go.
- One more jump.
20 seconds.
One more jump.
- I already jumped,
I'm not jumping I'm not jumping.
- 10, nine, eight, seven, six.
- Someone go.
- Let me go watch the replay real quick.
I'm gonna play the footage
and slowmo for the viewers.
As you can see,
the timer is on zero and
there were four people
still clearly on the platforms
when the timer hit zero.
The four people were
16, eight, 13, and five.
All right, so the four
losers, can you jump off?
Just jump, you're eliminated,
you're eliminated.
You're eliminated, get outta here.
Thank you for coming out.
And all of you are moving
onto the final game.
They're competing for $456,000, let's go.
Congratulations on
making it to the top six.
To celebrate, we made
you all steak dinners.
Now, unlike the show,
this isn't a real knife,
this is plastic.
But, you do have steak.
Everyone make sure you eat up,
so you have plenty of
energy for this final game.
- I'm thinking about winning
all of that money right now.
I'm probably give most of
it to my family, friends.
- That money's coming home with me,
giving $100K straight to my mama.
- I'm feeling great, it's
just blessed to be here.
- I'm gonna pull through,
I'm definitely donating
about 10,000 to TEAMSEAS,
which all of you should
if you have the means.
- I won't fold under no pressure.
I'm not worried about none of these five.
Ain't nobody got nothing
on me, so I'm good.
- You wanna just go settle
this with the final game?
- Let's do it.
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Let's do it.
- Welcome to the final
game of Beast Games.
So I think you guys can piece together
what we're about to play.
- Musical chairs.
- Musical chairs, yeah.
Let's test my hypothesis,
raise your hand if you know
how to play Squid Game.
Exactly, that's why we're
doing musical chairs instead,
because we're not Korean, start circling.
Start the music.
Karl, you can stop it whenever you want.
Karl do not look.
Chris, don't look.
Karl isn't looking so we can't be biased.
All right, let's see what happens.
Oh, oh he got it.
- I got more, man.
I'm pretty sure.
- He's way more.
I'm sorry about that.
Oh no.
- Sorry bro.
- Bring the coffin over here.
Hop on in the coffin.
He has officially been
eliminated, and five remain.
This chair is now gone.
Karl, start the music.
(ominous music)
Okay.
You have full...
Oh, hold on, hold on.
No more moving, come over here.
No why'd you get up?
- Nah, he had it.
He had it.
- At least he is honest.
Oh my gosh.
And while they're coffining
him up, play the music.
(ominous music)
Okay.
The music has begin.
$456,000 on the line.
- It's about to happen at any second.
- Oh man, oh, you sat.
Oh no.
- He sat early, he sat early.
- Karl did not stop the music.
Bring out the coffin, I'm
gonna have to pop you.
Man, that's such a sad way to go out.
- It was a great journey, I loved it.
It was so fun.
- Hop on in the coffin.
All right. Now you can't
say this is scripted.
Good luck.
(ominous music)
Okay.
The music has started.
Three people, two chairs.
One must go.
Keep it moving now.
You gotta keep moving.
Gotta keep moving.
Oh no.
- Yes!
- They were against me.
They were against me bruh.
- Oh my God.
- They plotted on me.
- You have been eliminated.
Open up the coffin.
Thank you for coming out, man.
- No problem.
- I loved your energy.
at the start of this
video, we had 456 people.
Now we're down to these two.
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
- Okay, I'm gonna take
this chair right here.
You guys gotta keep
moving the entire time.
No stopping and hovering.
This will determine which
one of you wins 456 grand,
Karl, kick the music on.
(ominous music)
Hey, let it play
a little bit, Karl.
Lets let them soak in it.
Karl's not looking at them.
He has no idea where
they are on the chair.
- Somebody's gonna get $456,000
because you pause the music.
- Oh boy.
Oh, this is, oh the intensity.
When will he pause it?
When's he gonna pause it?
- Yo, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!
Oh, my God!
- If it makes you feel better,
I'm gonna give you $10,000
for coming in second place.
- Oh, you're kidding me.
- No.

and officially won the very first
Squid Game in real life ever.

♪ Mr. Beast ♪
♪ Oh ♪"
cV2gBU6hKfY,"- This is one of the dirtiest
beaches in the entire world.
And we're gonna pick up
every single piece of trash
on this beach.
Starting with this water bottle.
One out of millions of pieces of trash.
- We did it!
- This will take forever.
[upbeat island music]
- Bottle me up, baby.
I'm hungry for your plastic.
- As you can see, this is taking forever.
Oscar, come on in.
This is Oscar, professional beach cleaner.
Is this basically how
you guys clean beaches?
- Mainly, we do the big stuff first
and then we bring a lot of
people with sifters as well
for the small stuff.
- You scoop it into this thing
and then shake out the sand,
and you got a bunch of trash.
This right here is the first bag of trash.
Hundreds more to go. How
do we do this quicker?
- We just need more people.
- That seems simple. Can you clap for me?
[Oscar clapping]
There you go! All the volunteers.
(crowd cheering)
- Okay guys, we're gonna
clean this up using the vice.
We're gonna clean this up. Groups of four!
Groups of four in this area.
- Part of me wanted to
see if me and the boys
could clean up this beach by ourselves,
and the other part of me realizes
that would've taken a year.
- I could've told you that.
- Jimmy!
- [Jimmy] Yeah?
The ocean's putting
more trash on the beach.
There's so much underwear in the ocean.
- I'm enacting a new law.
Thou shall not throw your
underwear in the ocean.
- Wait, did you guys
already fill up a bag?
- Yeah.
- You guys are better than us.
They are professionals to be fair.
(upbeat music)
- After 12 hours of cleanup,
this is what we managed to
achieve, which isn't enough.
Boys, bring it in.
Tomorrow, I'm gonna bring
in 10 times the volunteers.
Tomorrow.
(record scratching)
(flip-flop squeaks)
- Tomorrow.
- It's now the next day.
(crowd cheers)
(upbeat music)
- I'm helping.
- Nah, nah, nah.
- But as slowly as possible.
- Who's more bueno? Mark Rober or MrBeast?
- MrBeast.
(piano music)
- Make sure you watch
until the end of the video
to find out how we're gonna pick up
30 million pounds of trash.
- Thank you for coming to our country
and help us with this initiative.
That is really awesome.
(upbeat music)
- Right here. Right there.
Stop. He's not stopping.
I'm gonna move.
In this bad boy is 6,000 pounds of trash.
And now we have 36,000 pounds of trash,
which weighs the same as
3,000 cats or three T-rexes.
Whichever you prefer.
While I was talking
with some of the locals,
they mentioned that there's
a beach down the street
that was also very dirty.
So I said Nolan with a bunch of volunteers
to go clean that beach as well.
There's a whole car bumper right here.
- There's a car bumper here?
Did this come outta the ocean?
- People litter weird things.
- What type of trash have
you seen along the beach?
- Most importantly, most
commonly is plastics.
And we see that in every
form on the beach here.
- They ended up removing
12,000 pounds of trash,
which brought us up to a total
of 50,000 pounds of trash
from just two beaches.
- Check out this power move. Watch this.
Look at that!
- Is that how you want us to dump it?
- Yeah, dude, I'm taking one for the team.
I'm a team player.
Oh yeah. I don't even have to look.
- There you go, Mark.
- It actually kind of works.
- See?
- And if you guys look over there,
we're actually getting close
to the end of the beach.
This is what the beach looked
like at the start of the video.
And this is what it looks
like with like 20% left.
We're getting there.
- We're doing it!
- Unfortunately, between
the ocean washing up trash
to the beach and rivers
bringing in new trash from
the mainland, obviously this
beach is gonna get dirty again.
But with your guys' help, we
can stop a much bigger issue.
- We're almost done, Jimmy.
- I know! Four straight
days of picking up trash.
And just like that, we removed
over 60,000 pounds of trash
from the world's dirtiest beach.
And even though this 60,000
pounds of trash we picked up
might seem impressive,
there is sadly way too much
trash still in the ocean.
Two years ago, we crushed
our goals with Team Trees
and planted 20 million trees.
- And now it's time to do it again.
- Which is why we, along with
hundreds of other creators,
are launching Team Seas.
And for every $1 you
guys donate, like this,
one less pound of trash
will be in the ocean.
- But what if I wanted
to donate $10, Jimmy?
- I conveniently have 10
pounds of trash right here
that is now out of the ocean.
- Boom. Gone.
- You get the point.
One dollar donated as one less
pound of trash in the ocean.
And I'd like to personally
thank YouTube Originals
for supporting Team Seas
and helping us fund it.
They're gonna be matching
the first $400,000
worth of donations, dollar for dollar.
And we wanna remove 30 million pounds
of trash from the ocean.
- Which is just so freaking audacious.
This only happens if we all work together.
- Half the money we raise is going towards
funding volunteer beach
cleanups like we did here today,
all across the world, as well as literally
fishing trash out of the ocean.
- And the other half
will be used for these
trash-eating robots that
pick up trash 24 hours a day,
365 days a year, from rivers
that flow to the ocean.
- Go to teamseas.org or
click the donate button
below this video right now.
$1 equals one less pound
of trash in the ocean.
Making real change like
this isn't gonna be easy.
Go donate right now and help
us remove 30 million pounds
of trash from the ocean
before the end of the year.
Let's show the world that
we want a clean ocean.
(soulful music)
- What are you doing?
Get outta here. Go donate.
(bell dinging multiple times)"
qIsgdOVGA04,"- I grabbed 50 random people
and a brand new Lamborghini.
Everyone put your right hand on the car.
Whoever takes their hand off
last gets the $300,000 car.
(cheers)
And I have over 50
different cameras monitoring
every single hand on the Lamborghini.
We'll know if they take it off.
- Do you see how beautiful this car is?
It will be mine.
- As long as it takes,
we're not going home.
- I'm already ready to go home.
- You're probably wondering,
how do you use the bathroom?
Chris, rip off the windshield wiper.
(cheers)
We now have a windshield wiper
that if you're touching
with your right hand,
you are still technically
touching the car.
There you go.
You can get off the car.
(cheers)
I expected people to
get out in weird ways,
but I wasn't expecting
a little bit of water
to be one of 'em.
(yelling)
- Oh, he's out.
- What happened?
- It was all in my face and I reacted.
- Congratulations on being first out.
Here's a 1,000 dollars.
49 of you remain.
(cheers)
- It wasn't on purpose!
- You took the Lamborghini from that man.
- I know! And I feel bad, Cole.
Someone's eliminated.
Oh, I feel bad for them.
(laughs)
- 49 left, I'm not gonna be one of them.
- I think a lot of people
are gonna start slipping up,
because my brain's already slipping up.
It's only been 3 hours.
(rock music)
- Raise your right hand if you're hungry.
(crickets chirp)
(laughs)
One of these times,
we're gonna get someone.
But anyways, we brought you all pizza.
Give me a second.
(cheers)
- Oh yeah, good stuff.
- I'm hoping that while
they're all eating,
some people slip up and
take their hands off.
And with so many people packed together
it didn't take long for
something to happen.
- Somebody stepped on my foot,
and I moved my hand.
I got to see my kid, Doug.
(crowd awws)
- The Lambo would've been cool though.
- [Mr. Beast] It's harder than it looks
to remember not to use one of your hands.
All it takes is one little slip-up
and one of our 50 cameras will catch it.
The water bottle falls.
- Yep.
- You go to pick it up.
You then stare at the camera.
(contestants laugh)
Whoever gets out next
gets a special prize,
but you have 10 seconds.
- Me!
- [Mr. Beast] 10.
9.
- 8?
- [Mr. Beast] It is a brand new Nissan.
- Shut up!
- Congratulations on the brand new car.
Later, nerds. Drive us off.
- I don't know where we're going.
- And in case you're
wondering, every single person
on that Lamborghini is
walking away with a prize.
You should subscribe so you can compete
in one of these videos.
(upbeat music)
It's almost midnight and I'm
gonna give them sleeping bags
because I want them to fall
asleep and accidentally
take their hand off the Lamborghini.
Who wants the sleeping bags?
There you go, here's a sleeping bag.
I did not mean to hit him in the nuts.
There's some sleeping bags.
All right, everybody.
Get a good night's rest.
- I think these guys on the ground
definitely have a top tier strategy.
We don't trust ourselves sleeping
because our hands are gonna move.
- [Mr. Beast] It turns out he was right.
- Someone fell asleep and I
don't feel like waking him up.
I'm gonna give him $1,000
with this sticky note.
(laughs)
(dramatic music)
So you woke up and what'd you find?
- $1,000.
- Who put that there?
- I don't know.
(melancolic music)
(upbeat music)
- [Mr. Beast] Good morning, everybody.
28 of you survived the night.
How are you feeling?
- Half the team here
hate me, I don't know.
- I hate him, he talks too much.
- Oh wow. Really?
- I'm gonna be honest boys,
you've been pretty tame this video.
- Ooh.
Let's create mischief.
- And mayhem.
- Can I scooch past you?
(car revs)
Do you think that'd scare anybody?
If I did one of those real
loud and they're like, oh.
(car revs loudly)
(contestants yell)
I literally just said, do
you think that could happen?
- I just grabbed the bottle
and I'd looked up and I was like, dang,
I'm toast!
- Welcome.
Here's some prizes.
- Thanks so much, bro.
Still walked out with something.
Let's go!
- Could've won a Lambo.
- It's time we do something special, okay?
Bring in the ramp.
Full disclosure everybody,
we've built this ramp
for the last 10 minutes.
So, who knows what will happen?
(crowd cheers)
(rock music)
Oh, she clapped?
- I know, I clapped.
- Oh, really?
- [Crew Member] Let's go!
- We are now in the top 20.
Only 19 people stand between
you and a Lamborghini.
(electronic music)
Attention, everybody.
I have an announcement.
We just dropped our brand new documentary.
While I'm telling the viewers about it,
if one of you make a basketball shot
I'll give you 10 grand.
Our brand new documentary
is only available
on CuriosityStream.
(contestants cheer)
Did someone make it?
I need to do this quick.
CuriosityStream is the
number one streaming service
for science shows, space
shows, history shows,
basically anything educational
CuriosityStream has it.
Somehow while being jam-packed full of
educational information,
the shows are also
still very entertaining.
All right.
And stop shooting, stop shooting.
And like I said, it
also has our documentary
which I'll tell you how to
watch at the end of this video.
Of course, David freaking won the $10,000.
This guy's always winning money.
- Thank you.
- And congratulations, Corey.
- Thank you.
- At least this time you
didn't get out during the show.
- Yeah.
(electronic music)
- We're a little over a
day into this challenge
and so far 30 people have gone out.
I wanna get to the top
10 as soon as possible.
So I'm gonna bring out the big guns.
Bring her on.
As you can see, we have
another car to give away.
How many of you would like to walk away
with this brand new Mustang?
- It's a Camaro.
- It's a Camaro. I don't know cars.
Chris, can you drive it
back down and go hide it?
- [Chris] Yeah, I'll go ahead.
- And I think you guys can
piece where I'm going with this.
Whoever touches the
Camaro first can keep it.
(running sound effect)
(contestants cheer)
- [Mr. Beast] Oh!
(crowd voices overlap)
- Oh, we got another one.
(rock music)
- I wonder where the car is.
- Oh my gosh.
(screaming)
- Congrats on the new car.
- [Chandler] Yeah, that's a
good commercial for the car.
(car crashes)
Oh.
- Good thing we got other cars, right?
And now that those 4 contestants are out,
16 of you remain.
(contestants cheer)
Since these contestants survived this far,
I decided to reward them with some steak.
And I didn't realize how
hard it is to eat steak
with only one hand.
- It's so hard to eat.
- You got caught in 4k.
Here's the typical $1,000 prize.
Give it to random children if you want.
- I will do that.
- Jimmy took a nap but before he did
he gave us a bunch of money.
- So we put it in a cannon.
(cannon fires)
That hurt my knee.
3, 2, 1.
The strategy is when they
try to pick up the money,
they're gonna take their hand off the car.
- [Mr. Beast] And, it didn't work.
And then they all went to sleep.
Morning, everybody.
It's hard to wake you all up,
but two of you literally just got out.
We will start off with
our first victim, Corey.
- You just regained consciousness,
and couldn't figure out
where you were for a second.
- Our next person in question is asleep.
Oh, she did it again.
We don't have to show the footage now.
- Woo!
- We are one person off 10 people left,
which is exactly when this
challenge starts to get hard.
(contestants cheer)
- Final 10, baby.
And then it's gonna get crazy.
- We're about to do something crazy.
- I have been waiting for
this moment this whole time.
- Tomorrow's gonna be a
very big day for all of you.
So I'm gonna allow you to
duct-tape your hand to the car
for the night so you can get some sleep.
- I don't know if this is good or bad.
- Oh yeah, I can relax
my hand at some point.
Oh God.
Okay. Maybe not, I lied.
- I didn't interact with
them for a few hours
so they could fall asleep and
I could see what happened.
Let's just say that
people aren't that great
at keeping their hand on the Lamborghini
while they're asleep.
Let's go break the news to 'em.
All right, everybody.
As you can tell by the red
lights, Armageddon has happened.
Fidias, how many people
do you think got out?
- One?
- I hate to break the news to you but
half of you are literally out.
- Oh my God.
- [Mr. Beast] Everyone,
point your eyeballs
at the projector.
Up first is our boy Danny,
both your hands are clearly off.
- [Danny] I was asleep,
I didn't even know.
- Our next victim is David.
It appears your luck ran out.
An itchy nose just cost
you a $300,000 Lamborghini.
Up next, we have a Double Whammy.
So, we'll start off with our boy Neil.
You can clearly see
there's just no contact whatsoever, Neil.
It's okay.
Just another
(Akira cheers)
- Akira, if you look up here
at the screen, you're fine.
But your brother over here
might have some issues.
Scratched your head.
- Are you kidding me?
- [Mr. Beast] And then
went back under the tape.
Now that you've actually experienced it,
do you understand how he
lost a million dollars?
- Yeah, definitely.
This far in, it's a different realm.
- 1 final person has gotten out.
All right, pause it.
(contestants cheer)
(contestant screams)
I'm afraid she's gonna kill me.
At least your boyfriend's still in.
- Win this car for us!
- Everybody follow me in the prize room.
As a reward for making it to the top 10,
grab whatever you want.
You want that one, you want one?
Take another iPhone.
We'll make sure you guys
all walk out with some cash.
Here, take an iPad.
- I know there's a car out there,
but I'm low-key happy right now.
You know what I mean?
- [Mr. Beast] Oh my God.
This is why you've lost two Lamborghinis.
And after all of that, 6 of you remain.
One of you is literally
walking away with this
brand new Lamborghini.
This is what the Lamborghini
looked like at the beginning,
and this is what it looks like now.
And now it's time for the big surprise.
The Lamborghini is now being raised.
- Higher.
- And now the Lamborghini
has lifted 2 entire feet
off the ground,
and I can raise it all
the way up to the ceiling.
Do not forget that a
Lamborghini's on the line
and only one of you is getting it.
- It's not on the line, its in the air.
- This whole thing for me has
been about mental toughness.
- You gotta eliminate the
risk of mental failure
as much as possible.
- I want to get as much rest as possible
because I have a funny feeling
this will get more difficult.
- Me and Nolan have pretended to be asleep
in this Lamborghini for like an hour.
(car honks)
Should I open up the trunk?
Oh my God, he got out,
he got out, he got out.
- What did you wanna tell us?
- When you pulled this latch up,
I think my hand came up.
- We know it came up.
Here's the footage.
As a prize for making this far,
we're gonna give you $10,000 in cash.
- I actually meant to
lift the front trunk.
- Are you kidding me?
- And now that only 5 people remain,
Chandler, raise the Lamborghini!
You can raise it as high as you want
but that's probably a good spot.
You can stop.
I'm, I was about to run
over there, make it stop!
This is where things get fun
because every time someone gets out
we're gonna raise the Lambo.
(intense music)
Akira, what's going on buddy?
- [Akira] Jimmy, I'm at my breaking point.
- Think about it.
Think about the million dollar challenge
100 people last leave circle.
- [Akira] Jimmy, I'm not cut out for this.
I promise you though,
put me in the next challenge.
I will train every day.
- If that's the case,
I'll shake your right hand
and guarantee you a spot
in the next challenge.
- Put it there, Jimmy.
- Oh, let's go!
- Let's go!
- You just won $10,000 in cash.
- My right arm can't take it.
- Enough of this $10,000.
You need to go train
for the next challenge.
We now have 4 players left.
Chandler, raise it.
I give you permission to
go as high as you want.
That's probably high enough.
Chandler, if you go higher
Carl's not gonna be able to get out.
- I don't think I can anymore anyway.
- We trapped Carl.
If you haven't already,
hit the subscribe button below the video,
because this took a lot of time to put up.
I could make them do laps
around the Lamborghini,
stand on one leg and all sorts of things
to make this really hard.
But instead I'm just gonna leave them be
and see who actually wants it the most.
No messing around,
whoever has the most determination
is winning that Lamborghini.
Between me and you,
who are you the most afraid of?
- Myself failing.
- Wow, what a deep answer.
How about you, good sir.
How long have you lasted?
- I have a tattoo, your name.
- Since when did you get
a tattoo of my name here?
- You are my idol.
I don't want to disappoint you.
- Disappointing me is irrelevant.
A Lamborghini's on the line.
(intense music)
It's been 10 hours since someone got out,
let's make it harder.
We're gonna switch from a
hand to a single finger.
Which finger are you choosing?
The pointer finger.
Okay.
Which finger are you choosing?
- Going to the pointer as well.
- Okay, pointer finger.
Oh, keep that bad boy on.
- Oh, this is hard, boy.
- All that matters is that pointer finger.
They pick pointer fingers.
She picked her pinky.
We have a Lamborghini on the line.
These are big decisions.
Pointer finger, okay.
Three people chose their pointer finger
and she chose her pinky.
As of now, you all know the rules,
things got more interesting.
- I'm 100% sure now that
you don't fake videos.
Because I've been awake for 50 hours.
- [Mr. Beast] Standing for this
long was really starting to
wear the contestants down.
And soon enough, they
started making some offers.
What are you proposing, sir?
- How about a flat 20,
and one of those MacBooks?
- You drive a hard bargain. I love it.
20 grand and a MacBook,
if you get out right now.
Oh my gosh!
As you requested, here's $20,000
in cash and a brand new MacBook.
Congratulations in coming in 4th place.
You said you had a proposal.
Let me hear it.
- 25,000 would cover a
portion of my student loans,
my phone and my roommate's
phone broke in the last week.
- Replacing your phones and
25 grand for student loans.
I don't have a problem with that.
Let's shake on it.
Oh my gosh.
Oh, and her hand's very sweaty.
All their hands are sweaty.
Thank you for coming out.
I hope you had fun.
- 50 people comes down to
two people, is me and you.
- Oh my gosh! I'm just kidding.
- This is crazy.
- You're saying this is crazy?
Wait for me to raise the Lamborghini.
- No! No!
- Good luck, Fidias.
- Yeah, I, whoa.
- What? That wasn't much.
- Enough.
- Are you on your tippy toes?
- Yes! Please.
- Okay. All right, fine. I'll chill.
Okay.
- Gentlemen, one of you is walking away
with this Lamborghini above your head.
And one of you isn't.
Good luck.
- I'm coming for Fidias.
No matter what, even if
it takes the death of me.
- [Fidias] I love you, brother.
- Love you too.
- Your arm is fully extended.
Your finger has to be hurting.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
- Oh, really?
- It doesn't feel great.
Hurting so bad.
- Your finger's shaking
more than I've seen
this whole challenge.
2nd place does give 40 grand,
which isn't a $350,000 car
but 40 grand's better than nothing.
Oh, well.
Seriously think about this.
- It hurts so bad.
- How about Fidias is just like.
- He's in no pain, and I'm dying.
- Just take it off!
- No!
- Oh my goodness.
It's only you.
(Noah screams)
- Oh my gosh!
I didn't know if you were joking or not.
- I just won!
- Here is $40,000 in cash, and Fidias!
Are you crying for real?
And while he's driving
his brand new Lamborghini

cExLQ1o2pDw,"- There's over $100,000
inside of this bank vault.
And now that it's sealed
this key is the only way to get inside.
And whichever one
of these guys touches the
vault first gets what's inside.
Go!
- Oh boy.
- What do we do?
- Oh.
- Hey, Chris is through.
Is anyone else gonna make it?
Oh, and Chris touch the vault!
- I didn't really even do anything yet.
- Just pull on the handle.
- Oh.
- You get nothing.
This was just a decoy vault.
Now the boys are gonna run
through all the challenges
and hope that the safe
they win is the safe
with the $100,000 prize for their dad.
- Oh my God.
Nolan go.
He's going.
Nolan, watch out.
There's one over your head right now.
- Oh.
- Did Chandler hit one?
- No, no
It was so close.
- I'm so scared.
- Watch out, watch out, watch out.
- I'm gonna go for it.
- Nolan's making progress.
He's about to win and there we go.
- Yes!
- No! No!
- Why am I so good at this?
- Because you're so skinny and lanky.
- Did your dad just win a hundred grand?
Or next stage you have to carry mannequin.
- Are you kidding me?!
- At least the mannequin's very handsome.
- He is so handsome.
- Welcome to my favorite room.
The city of red solo cups.
There's over 1 billion
red solo cups in here.
- I just don't think that's true.
- Don't count them.
What could you possibly find
in here that would open a safe?
- A key!
- A key!
- I said it first.
- A key.
- Begin searching.
This is so satisfying to watch.
I don't even feel like
they're looking for the key.
- Chandler find that key, man.
- Oh! Boo-yah!
- That's what I'm talking about!
- Whooo!
- Let's see what your dad just won.
It's if you win the
hundred thousand dollars
your dad also gets a Tesla now.
- Whoo, yes!
- Keep watching.
Let's go to the next one.
I brought the boys to our
next safe and blindfolded them
so they couldn't see the garage door.
That is now falling.
You gotta make it under, go.
- Oh, do they make it?
Oh Karl did it.
Karl touched it first.
- Come on, show me a hundred grand.
- It's probably not a hundred grand.
- It's not a hundred grand,
but your dad did win $10,000 in cash.
- Yeah man.
You don't care about your dad?
- I tried, I ran.
- Pathetic.
- Let's see if the next
vault has a hundred grand.
This is a mountain of Legos.
And that is a key dangling in the air.
- Look at it dangle.
- Whichever one of you
uses those Legos to
build to that key first
gets what's in the vault.
- You go Karl.
- Start stacking, start stacking them.
- You weren't even close.
- He's a rule breaker.
- Chandler, you have a good vertical.
Can you try to jump and grab it?
- Oh my ankle. You see that?
- And while the boys are
trying to grab that key,
I want tell you guys about
Current, the future of banking.
With Current, you can do all
your banking on your phone.
You can literally sign up,
send and receive money.
Cash checks all from
within the Current app.
- Oh.
- Oh.
- A piece.
- No, he almost had it.
- This is the same company
that sponsored this video
and gave everyone that signed up $1
and 10 people a thousand dollars.
- Oh, he got it.
- Nice.
- And I got it.
- Before you open that, can
you apologize to Current
for cutting off the ad?
- I'm very sorry Current.
- What's in the safe?
- Hundred grand baby.
- It's not a hundred grand.
It is, If you don't win the
next challenge your kicked
- All this hard work to get nothing.
You pick the worst one to win.
- If you don't win this
next challenge, man
I'll be so disappointed.
- We're back in the laser
room and turn them on.
- How are we suppose to
make it through this?
- As you see it disappears
and then reappears.
- Okay?
- You have to cross in between the lasers
when they disappear.
I need to finish telling you about Current
because Chandler interrupted us.
- Sorry.
- The first 100,000
people to download Current
and use the code Beastbank.
I will literally deposit $1
into your Current account.
- Wow, that's free money.
- This is my Current tag.
And I'm gonna be sending
$20,000 in cash to random people
that request money.
If you switch your direct
deposit over to them
you'll get 5,000 points
which you can redeem for this sexy

And you can get this
beautiful Current card.
- Chandler?!
- Yeah?
- If you touch a laser,
you and your dad are out.
- I know.
- He's gonna attempt
it when it disappears.
Okay. Made it.
That's one.
Can he do it again?
- This is nerve wracking.
- Okay.
- Hey, why aren't you guys joining him?
- We didn't-
- Oh, what is this,
the Chandler challenge?
- Kind of.
- Oh, he's over here.
- We made it.
- That's it skinny boy.
- This is the last one Chandler.
This has the shortest duration
between when it disappears
and comes back.
Oh, wait, wait, wait, I
need to see the slowmo.
He's about to do it.
There is no break in the laser.
He successfully did it. Congrats.
- Yes! We didn't get kicked.
- Chandler, what's in the vault?
Oh, it's upside down.
- I hope you're Chandler.
Wait. How'd you know?
- I did this before you guys came in here.
- Oh.
- You won nothing, but at least
you're not kicked Chandler.
(cheering)
- This vault is protected by
a plunge of electric wires.
The wires only react to
metal, so it's safe to touch.
But I tried to scare the
guys with this little trick.
Just to show you what would
happen if you did touch it,
I would recommend you don't.
- No!
- There's sparks?!
- I thought it would look
hilarious to watch the boys tiptoe
around these wires thinking
they were actually electric.
But Chris, for whatever reason
just had no fear and just
ran straight through it.
- Oh!
- Oh!
- Chris touched it.
Anyways, Chris thought he won.
The guys thought he cheated.
So we decided to move on to the next room.
Thank you, Chris.
Welcome to the next room.
- What the heck?
- Everyone take a stand.
You guys are gonna be voting
for who opens the safe.
Maybe there's a hundred
grand behind that vault.
- So what's the rule,
we can't vote for ourself or something?
- You can't vote for yourself.
That is correct.
- Ooh, I knew it!
- Right? Who you want to open the safe?
Who'd you vote for?
- Karl!
- Yeah, baby!
- I voted for Nolan because
I don't want him to win,
and he'll somehow find a way.
- Nebraska Nolan.
- Nolan has two votes.
And Chandler who did you vote for?
- Chris.
- Chris? Which means
Nolan won with two votes.
- Yes, a hundred thousand dollars!
I'm gonna get this.
Dad I think this is it.
I feel it.
It's a hundred grand.
- Okay.
- Please don't be it, please
don't be inside of it.
- Next room you get to
use a metal detector.
- What for?
- Inside this giant beach is a key.
Let the challenge begin.
I think you can see why
you want a metal detector.
- I can detect the key.
- Stop. I'm trying to find a key!
- Oh, why are you trying
to use your metal detector?
Why don't you detect this?
- Oh, I found it.
I got it.
No! Move off me.
I got a rock.
- He thought the rock was the key.
- I got sandy for nothing.
- Okay. I'm gonna be honest.
They found the key, but it broke.
- It doesn't count.
- It does count.
- Yes!
- Congratulations.
On winning a $5,000 home Depot gift card.
(cheering)
- I'll take it.
- That's every dad's dream!
At the start of this video,
this big vault was empty
and we covered it with a black sheet.
But now we're gonna fill the same vault
with the $100,000 cash prize.
We're about to see whose
dad wins a hundred grand.
As you can see, you are
back in the first room.
- You put nails up there?
- Yeah, I don't want you climbing over it.
Remember whoever touches this
first gets what's inside.
- A hundred grand.
- Oh, I didn't say go.
- He didn't say go.
- He didn't say go.
- But I just said, go.
- Go!
- Don't kill me!
- There you go Chris, that was a good one.
- That was a lot of glass!
- How do I get through this?
- Ah! Ah!
- What am I doing wrong?
- Guys just break the glass.
- Hey Nolan, Watch out.
- Oh, Nolan touched it.
Nolan, the vault is unlocked.
Have at it.
- Hundred grand.
- Here we go.
Yes! Hundred grand!
Look at all this money! Look at all of it!
Look dad, you get hundred grand!
- I'm so proud of you Nolan.
You're the best bank robber ever.

uocETPj4Jx4,"- This is half a million

in cash.
And whichever one of
them, I tag last keeps it.
10,

eight,
- Oh my God. Oh my God.
- [Jimmy] seven,
- Oh my God.
- [Jimmy] six,
five,
- Oh boy.
- [Jimmy] four,
three,
- All right. We're going into the stadium.
- [Jimmy] Two,
one.
Ready or not,
here I come.
- [Contestant] Everyone's
running this way.
I don't know if that's a good thing.
- Look at all those people.
(bell dings)
(bubble popping)
These people are actually the finalists
from my previous video.
They literally sat in a
circle for 12 days straight
to earn a spot in this
game of tag.
This stadium could fit over
160,000 people inside of it.
This is gonna take forever.
- I'm running as far away as I can.
It's gonna get exhausting, quick.
- So I made an alliance
with Classy and Blakely.
And we have a triangular formation
to make sure nobody gets caught.
- Airrack's over there
watching the exit that way.
I'm watching the hallway this way.
And we got Blakely watching down there.
- It's definitely nerve wracking.
- We're currently on the
first of three floors.
And if I was trying to hide from me,
I would go as far away as possible,
which would take me to the third floor.
- Oh, this is pretty comfortable.
- Oh yeah, V suite, you know.
- I'm hiding here
behind this electrical box.
- As you can see,
this hallway is super long.
There's like,
50 rooms.
I'm gonna check them, one at a time.
That one's locked.
- All right, this door over here.
(bell dings)
But I'm pretty sure it's locked.
- I've been searching for hours
and haven't tagged a single person.
This place is just too big.
Attention contestants,
it's taking me forever to find you,
so I'm bringing in Chris and Chandler.
Come on up.
Chris, you go that way.
Chandler, you go that way.
I'm just pointing places.
Let's go.
- Both Chris and Chandler
are now looking for us
along with Jimmy.
(suspenseful music)
(bell dings)
- Who is that?
You see that over?
- Oh, there's people.
Go, go, go, go,
(bell dings)
go, go, go!
- [Jordan] Aahh!
(bell dings)
- Yes, yes! We got someone.
(buzzer buzzes)
- [Jimmy and Chandler] Yeah!
- [Jimmy] Oh, oh my gosh.
Attention contestants.
We got our very first person out.
- I think it was Jordan,
the girl in the green shirt.
They just escorted her over there.
- Here's a briefcase with
$10,000. (cash register ding)
We gotta tag more people.
- I guess one down, nine more to go.
- And while I was giving Jordan her money,
Chris saw Chris.
That sounded weird.
- Right there. (bell dings)
Go, go, go.
He's down here, down here, down here.
- [Jimmy] Don't hate me,
but Chandler might have
outran the cameraman
and tagged Chris off camera.
(punching sound)
Whoops.
(buzzer buzzes)
- No way.
- Pretty devastated.
He's a fast man.
- If it makes you feel better,
here's $10,000. (cash register ding)
- Thank you so much.
- Attention contestants.
A second person has fallen.
Only eight of you remain.
We're coming for all of you.
Taylor, you are so fast
that Frank couldn't keep up.
(bell dings)
- He's really fast.
- Here's a GoPro. Wear it.
- How do you feel being top eight?
- I feel fire. How do you feel?
- I feel bored. (laughing)
- [Jimmy] Now, remember
that these contestants are only competing
for half a million dollars
(bell dings)
because they're subscribed to our channel.
If you wanna one day be

hit the

(punching sound)
It is currently 5:00 AM,
and Chandler and Chris want to go to bed.
So, I've replaced them
with SapNap and Carl.
Let's go hunt more people.
- It's me, Carl and SapNap.
- Let's get it!
- [Jimmy] Carl, SapNap and I searched
throughout the entire night
and couldn't find anyone.
Somehow the contestants had
enough energy to outrun us
until the morning.
- It's the entire next day.
We've been out for so long.
- If yesterday were the semifinals,
today's the finals.
- It's gonna be stressful.
I am fatigued mentally and physically.
- We've only found two people so far.
But here's the thing,
it's tag, not hide and seek.
- Ooh.
- So, I'm gonna activate
the GPS
(bubble popping)
I put on all their phones.
(notification bling)
And I see a person over there.
You let 'em know.
- Hey, a little heads up,
Jimmy turned your guys tracker on
and he is on his way to catch you.
- He turned the GPS tracker on
and we're not sure if,
what's gonna happen now.
- Thanks to the tracker,
we found Jessica,
I saw someone right up here.
chased her down,
- Leave me alone!
- [Frank] Get her Carl, get her.
- [Jimmy] and tagged her.
- Oh.
Yo.
- [Jimmy] Right there Carl,
(bell dings)
is a ton of people.
Here. Can you take yourself to prison?
I gotta go.
- Take $500,000 from me,
(cash register ding)
and you're not even
gonna take me to prison?
(cash register ding)
- Another person down.
Only seven of you remain.
- Jessica just got out.
So it looks like,
I am carrying this for the ladies.
- We gotta contest meetup over here.
How we doing? (explosion)
- Ooh.
- Seven people left.
How you feelin'?
- I feel good.
(walkie talkie beeps)
- Wait.
Contestants, did one of
you get it a bad wreck
or did one of you flip a golf cart?
- It may or may not have
been me and Airrack.
(heavy metal music)
- Huh!
- We just flipped a golf cart.
- Why exactly did you flip a golf cart?
- Because the keys were in it
and they told us we couldn't drive it.
And if we can't drive it, neither can you.
- It's funny content.
So, I'm okay with it.
Despite having the tracker,
this place was just too big.
For whatever reason,
it had a ten second delay.
(clock ticking)
So by the time I got to where they were,
they were already on the
other side of the stadium.
- We're moving across the whole stadium
to try to get like, a better angle,
maybe a better spot.
Because you always gotta keep moving,
you know what I mean?
- We started this challenge
almost 20 hours ago,
and we've literally
only found three people.
I've never felt more
defeated in my entire life.
Why did we pick such a huge stadium?
I can't find anyone.
I need to drastically shrink this place,
or this is gonna go on for a week.
- Y'all, something's about to change.
We've been walking around forever,
and Jimmy said he's making an announcement
in a couple of seconds.
- It's time I do something drastic.
This is supposed to be a game
of tag, not hide and seek.
I'm gonna shrink the entire stadium down
to just the racetrack.
You have 10 minutes.
And one of you is getting
half a million dollars.
(cash register dings)
- Oh my gosh.
- This is full on tag.
No hiding.
- I think this is gonna
get a whole lot faster,
a whole lot quicker.
- Going in the circle
with Andy right now.
I think our plan is to
stay as mobile as possible.
- Like I said before,
contestants you have
10 minutes to get down
to the racetrack.
I'm in the middle with my eyes closed.
Go.
One, (intense music)
two,
- You're gonna count to 10 minutes?
- three, four,
- I guess we're just doing this.
- five,
Close your eyes.
Six...
(intense music)
- [Jimmy and Chris] 51, one minute 52,
one minute 53,
(intense music)
(both mumbling numbers)
- Ready or not, here we come.
We're ripping money out your hands.
- Huddled up, next to a Lambo.
Pretty cool.
- I think I got a pretty good spot.
If I need to move that way I can.
I can be here.
- It's gonna make me
uncomfortable to rip $500,000
out of a stranger's hand.
- I think he's going inside
the red building right
in front of us.
We are unnoticed, so far.
- We're in here.
- I sure hope there aren't
no people trying to hide.
- Oh Chris, Chris, Chris, Chris.
Out to the right. Out to the right.
All right?
(bell dings)
All right, on three.
Three, go.
(intense music)
- [Chris] My legs are
hurting from yesterday.
Jimmy, I'm on the left side flank.
I see him.
He's back on the back wall,
running right side.
(bell dings)
- Oh, hey.
There's another guy.
They're trying to do a splitzy ditzy.
I'm holding up a number behind my back.
Is it one or two?
What's your pick?
- Two.
- What's your pick?
- One.
- It was one.
Chris target red.
(intense music)
Okay, we made a mistake.
We made a mistake.
We're going for green.
He's slower.
You know it's serious
cause the hat's gone.
- [Andy] I'm hiding next
to a Lambo right now.
I dunno if that's metaphor
for something or what?
But...
- Let's just, let's just come in these.
- Oh no.
(intense music)
(buzzer buzzes)
- Oh hey wait, wait, wait Chris, Chris.
Forget about her.
He's getting away.
This man here is ruthless.
Go right there.
(intense music)
Yeah.
Oh my gosh.
We were chasing him,
and you just popped outta nowhere.
- I thought you guys saw me.
I thought both of you
made eye contact with me.
So I decided to dip.
- Not only did we get one person out,
(bell dings)
but we just got two people out.
(bell dings)
Only five of you remain.
And one of you is getting
half a million dollars.
(cash register dings)
- 500,000 dollars, right there.
Five people left in tag.
- This is it.
Made it to the finals.
- This is so scary.
I'm gonna try to steal a Lambo.
- All right.
We subbed Chris out for SapNap.
Let's do this.
Five people remain.
Most of them are pretty quick.
I need your help.
- You got it.
(bell dings)
- What's up?
- Sup?
- Pretty good spot.
- Find a spot where I can see,
and find a spot where I can run.
- I see them.
I see 'em in the middle.
You see 'em?
- Yeah.
- Where are they?
- I don't know.
- I thought I saw someone over here.
(intense music)
(buzzer buzzes)
Help me. Help me.
Sap help.
- Trust me.
You don't wanna catch me.
I'm getting the golf cart.
I can't outrun these guys.
I gotta steal a Lambo.
Hey, you don't wanna tag me.
Trust me.
Oh lock.
Lock, lock, lock.
- Wait.
Is he getting in the Lamborghini?
Wait, did he just...
- [SapNap] He's stuck.
- Great, move out the way.
- Go, go. Wrong door.
Jimmy, get on the other door.
- They're right on the other side of us.
- Oh no.
This is bad.
- All right.
Now he can't drive it.
All right.
We got him boxed in.
- No, no, no, no, no, no jam.
No, no.
- They're on the other side
of this car.
- He probably thinks
one of us has to leave,
and he just starts out the door.
Well, here's the thing.
I make the rules.
Hey Carl, can you bring
me the Lamborghini key?
- Oh no, no, no, no.
This is not how I expected
this to go down, man.
I don't want to hang out with Carl.
I don't wanna see this guy.
I don't wanna see Carl.
- Come over here.
- Hey, hey, hey.
I have not tagged anyone yet.
Give me the keys.
- Give Jimmy the keys.
- Give me the keys.
- Oh no.
- You are officially
going to be my first tag.
(buzzer buzzes)
- Yes.
- I actually got someone out.
If we actually left the
keys in that Lamborghini,
he could have zipped.
- I would've left, yeah.
I wouldn't be here anymore.
- They're walking away.
They were next to us for like 10 minutes.
- Step on into the prison.
And boom!
Only three people remain.
To the three of you that
are still out there,
only one of you is getting
half a million dollars,
(cash register dings)
and the other two will be sad.
(somber music)
(intense music)
- Absolutely terrifying.
It's down to three people.
- Somehow, I'm in the top three
for $500,000 dollars.
- I have to keep fighting.
I did not abuse my body for nothing.
- Oh, in Goodyear.
Hey, there's a guy in Goodyear.
- Oh man.
I can see them.
I don't know if they can see me.
I could be giving myself away.
- He can only go out
the left, (bell dings)
the right
(bell dings)
or the middle.
(bell dings)
There's only three ways he can leave.
- I'm gonna hide behind the U-Haul.
I need you to make noise that way.
And then whenever he runs this way,
- You'll get him?
- let me know,
and I'll get him.
(intense music)
(buzzer buzzes)
- Oh.
- Yes!
- No!
- I'm sorry
- Aahhh!
- Carl.
You genius.
- It worked. It worked.
- Yes. This is the weirdest
thing we've ever done.
If it makes you feel any better as
a consolation prize for
coming in third place,
we're gonna be giving you
$20,000 dollars.
- That's awesome.
(everyone clapping)
- Lincoln and Andy, you guys spent
12 days in a circle
and 24 hours running
from us in a game of tag.
And it all comes down to this.
One of you is getting
half a million dollars.
I'm gonna go find you.
- Top two, I guess.
- This is it.
- I gotta stay focused cause two
is great,
but it doesn't matter
till it's number one.
- We've literally done this for 24 hours.
One more person,
and then I get to go to bed.
That is ironic.
I saw him move from it.
- I really hope he didn't,
but I think he might have saw me.
- Hey, whoever's behind
that white barrel,
(bell dings)
go ahead and stand up.
Go 'head, stand up.
I see you.
Hey, we come in peace.
We come in peace.
- All right. All right. All right.
What do you guys want?
- They might have found someone.
I can't tell.
- Before I start chasing after you,
I'm just curious.
- Yeah.
- If you do win,
(bell dings)
what are you spending the
half a million dollars on?
- I wanna set up my future and I wanna,
I wanna help other people.
- Hopefully you outrun me then.
- All right.
- Go ahead and get a little closer, Carl.
- You might as well go that way, bro.
You are not getting past me.
(intense music)
- It is Andy.
Oh my God. Oh my God.
Andy's running.
(everyone screaming and cheering)
(dramatic music)
- Get him Jimmy!
(buzzer buzzes)
- You got him!
- I got him!
- I think it was the stupid
fanny pack. (laughing)
- Oh my God.
Did I just win this?
Did I just...
- Congratulations Lincoln!
You just won half a million dollars!
(energetic music) (everyone cheering)
- Oh my god, bruh. (laughing)
(horn honking)
- And on top of this brand new car,
you also won
$10,000 in cash.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, so congratulations.
- Thank you so much.
(explosion)
- Lincoln!
This is literally
half a million dollars
(cash register dings)
in one dollar bills.
Do you wanna get inside of it?
Cause it's all yours.
- I'm jumping in.

zxYjTTXc-J8,"- [Mr. Beast] I put 100 people
inside of a giant circle
and whoever leaves the
circle last wins $500,000.
But if you touch the
red line it's game over
I don't care how long this takes.
Whichever one of you leaves
last wins half a million dollars
(cheering)
- $500,000.
- Oh, I cleared my schedule.
I am literally good for next three weeks.
- However long it takes. Weeks.
Months. It doesn't matter.
- How long are you staying in this circle?
- Well, I took off work until January 1st.
You took off work for the next six months?
- There's literally a hundred people.
This place is packed.
They brought grass down.
The possibilities are endless.
- There's only one smart thing to do.
To begin the hibernating process.
- This guy right here is already
thinking about getting out.
He might be our first loser.
- To be honest, there's
a hundred people here.
I'm not gonna win.
What's the point?
- Hey everybody, this guy
just said he wants to get out.
All right, let's see it.
(cheering)
He's overplaying this so much.
Just step out.
Oh
Even though you got out first,
I still have a prize for you.
Just wait here.
Congratulations.
You just want a brand new
car for being first out.
- Who would've thought
being a loser would pay off
- Someone just left.
Honestly, I knew he'd be first.
I smelled the weakness from the beginning.
- Massive morale boost.
If everyone's weak like that
they're gonna be gone in no time.
- Time to update the board.
99 remain. Good luck.
Knowing they can win a random prize.
Definitely wore a few people down
and after a couple of hours,
things got a little emotional.
- This is gonna change my life.
Tomorrow I'm gonna take a
lot of this to pay my bills.
Thank you so much.
I was not expecting that.
She's got me about to cry.
I can't wait to see how
the person that wins
the half a million dollars at
the end of the video reacts.
- I'm about to raise the stakes.
- I hope you guys like filet mignon.
Cause we got you all a steak.
(cheering)
- They sent the filet mignons.
- Yeah, just casually eating
a steak at a pile of money.
- If they're gonna be
feeding us like this,
I could be here like for
the rest of the year.
- It's now nighttime of the first day
and 94 people are still in this.
Little do they know
I have something in store
for them in the morning.
Now it's time I introduced the
twist at the end of each day
we're gonna shrink the
circle a little bit.
We're gonna bring the new line to...
Is that good?
I'll do a little bit more.
All right, I'll go ahead
and start filling it
- Are you going to do all that?
- Nope.
When the camera cuts,
someone else will do it.
After seeing the new circle,
a few people started to crack
- Whoa, whoa, Jimmy, Jimmy.
So you're gonna play him
in rock paper scissors
and if you lose you'll get out?
- Are you kidding me?
- Rock, paper, scissors, chute.
Imagine losing $500,000
on a single game of rock paper scissors.
- That was the dumbest thing ever.
There was no upside.
- They just wouldn't stop
getting out one after another.
It seems like two days in a circle
is most people's limits.
There's someone sleeping on a cereal box.
It's getting serious.
- It's nighttime of the second day
and Karl decided to start some trouble.
- One second.
- And I think I just watched
one of the guys reach over the line.
- No way
- No.
- That's half a million dollars
worth of fruit snacks right there.
- I don't know who threw the gummies.
- Not only have the
contestants spent three days
in that circle,
but we've spent three days living here.
I've been sleeping in that RV.
- Morale's getting a little low.
- Hope breakfast is
something a little bit better
than oatmeal.
- Boredom's starting set it.
- I don't like oatmeal.
It taste like wet cardboard.
So this is pretty rough, to be honest.
The circle's gonna shrink again.
Not looking forward to that.
- It's the start of the third day.
So we gotta shrink this circle again.
- Boo
- Wait, wait, wait. Are you sure-
I'm not letting Chandler do this again.
Chandler made this line so long.
This is kind of boring.
Now the circle is fully painted in.
As you can see, we took a lot
of space out of this circle.
And while we were painting,
- Throughout this challenge
we realized that if we
give people things to do
they'll occasionally mess
up and touch the line
which is exactly why we put
this soccer goal here to see
if we could get some people out.
- I'm crossing my fingers.
I'm crossing my fingers.
- You stepped on it right there.
The soccer goal worked.
It's the start day of number four.
So we gotta shrink the circle again.
Chandler, I'm gonna trust you.
This is like three more feet.
I'll see you when it's done.
And there you go.
It literally took two
seconds to fill in the line.
- Whoa
- That's a lie
- It's like magic.
- You're lying.
- It's been a few hours
since someone got out. Karl.
- I know what I need to do.
I wanted to give you
guys music to listen to.
(alarm clock noise)
It's just a 10 hour loop.
- Does that make anyone wanna get out?
- This is music to my ears
because I press snooze
Every time.
- Do you think anybody's
gonna leave because of this?
- I don't think anybody's
gonna leave because of this.
- So you were saying you would get out
for a brand new iPhone?
- Yeah. I need a new phone badly.
- Here you go.
- Ride of into the sunset.
- Now that she's out,
we're gonna keep playing that.
They didn't like the phone alarm sound.
So now I'm playing man
screaming for ten hours.
(cheering)
- He got it.
- Hey, Karl.
- Karl, we just want to talk.
Come here Karl.
- Get him.
- Get out Karl.
I got you.
- Day five.
- It's just a fever dream now.
Everyone wakes up screaming.
(laughs)
- I not going to lie
it's slowing down a little bit,
but I'm gonna try to keep going.
- All right, everybody.
You know what time it is?
We gotta shrink this circle.
Right there.
Jump cut. Boom.
- I can move now.
- The circle keeps getting smaller
and people are dropping like flies.
- Halfway done.
- Grass ball has taken over
my entire mental capacity.
It's all I can think about
- Grass ball.
- I'm losing brain cells by the second.
I just lost 10.
- We started day six like
usual by shrinking the circle.
Since they want me to take a lot,
I'm just gonna take a little bit.
And then I made a mistake
by putting Nolan in charge.
- If anybody's butt even
touches a blade of grass.
You're out.
- It's been five seconds and
he is already instigating.
- New rule. No making fun of Nolan.
- The standing challenge
got one contestant out.
Sorry bro.
- Simon says
Hit yourself in the face.
(laughs)
Simon says, do a push up.
I can't do a push up without
my stomach touching ground.
So I'm not doing it.
All right, just don't do it then.
Your knee touch?
Unfortunately your knee
did touch the ground.
Here's your thousand dollars.
(cheering)
I have so much power.
Is this what Jimmy feels like?
- Do you all know why
the party lights are on?
Because you survived an entire week inside
of this circle.
To celebrate an entire
week inside of this circle.
I decided to give them a challenge
with the Tesla as a prize.
Who wants a Tesla?
(cheering)
The boys are rolling out a special tarp.
Starting now all of you can
walk on this thing right here.
If you can ride this and touch the Tesla
without touching the ground,
I'll let you keep it.
You're not doing it?
- No, that's scary bro.
- Okay. Oh, he's getting run.
All right everybody's
back up. Let's see this.
Is this it?
Is this it?
- No.
- They're literally engineering a team
to win this man a Tesla
- All right.
- He's on the tire. They're
about to launch him.
Oh.
Did he step out?
Okay. Everyone time out.
We gotta review footage.
We'll be right back.
Unfortunately, Corey
definitely stepped on the line.
Get rid of this thousand dollars.
Give him five thousand dollars.
Thank you for putting
others above yourself.
Then finally, with the help of
Airrack to give him momentum
Jack did the unthinkable.
He got it.
Get on in. Let me see what you think.
- Oh my God.
- Look at him.
- Going to throw up in my own car.
- We had to help.
Guy just won a Tesla.
I'm incredibly proud.
It's unbelievable.
- Before I brought the
Tesla in we had 36 people.
Now we're down to 32.
The numbers are dwindling.
It's day eight and we needed
to do something different.
So we split the contestants
up by their shirt colors
into quadrants.
Today is day number eight.
And so far no one's gotten out.
So I made this mystery wheel
because we need to get some
people out who wants to spin it?
- Hey, I'll spin it.
- Spin it hard though.
Not no like half spin.
That's exactly what I was looking for.
(cheering)
- Congratulations. You just
won three thousand dollars.
- He just spun and won three
grand and he's going again.
- David. Go for it.
All right. Let's see it.
He found an infinite money glitch.
What the hell. How does he keep doing it?
- Jimmy came out saying
we gotta get people out.
And David is rocking three briefcases.
- I just don't think that
could have gone any worse.
- It's day nine and we lost another person
during the evening.
But then something happened
that I never would've expected.
- Oh my God.
- Will you marry me?
- Yes.
- Did you guys see that one coming?
- No.
- Let's give it up for
them. Congratulations.
Sounds like we need to get
a briefcase for $10,000
to go towards the wedding.
- I've been in the circle
for the past nine days,
but I could not be happier.
- Now. It's time for a
very important message.
We are too lazy to write the other half,
but you should still subscribe.
Are you guys subscribed?
That's exactly why they're here.
Hit the button. You can be in a video.
Woo.
And now it's time to shrink
this circle for the day.
All right, instead of shrinking the circle
we're expanding the line.
But now it's time
we introduced the difficult part.
Earlier, I asked them to pair up
and now we're gonna be duct
taping the pairs together
for the day.
For the rest of the day you
could also no longer sit down.
- Day nine and guess what they did to us?
- Let's go.
- Forever together.
- Forever, forever
- Together forever.
- Ha, ha
- Oh boy.
- How are you feeling?
- I don't really like
my partner that much.
So it's gonna be kind of hard.
- Well, this is awkward
- Earlier when I was
explaining the rules that
this happened
and I had the replay right here
and as you can see, he
stepped on the line.
Neil, man.
First he loses a Lamborghini
and how half a million dollars.
Neil, buddy.
I pulled up the footage.
It's on the line.
I'm sorry, Neil.
- All right, I guess I'll take my walk.
- Here's two thousand dollars.
- Oh, it's still bitter
- What's wrong?
- We've been final two this
whole time from day one.
And I was hoping I'd be
there with him at the end,
but that's the game.
- I've never seen Akira
this determined before.
He looks like a man that's gonna win this
- Mark my words that man's
gonna win this challenge.
I promise you.
Get it, Akira.
- Boys, put the balance
beam on that quadrant.
Bring it on over.
Now this is $10,000 in cash.
I'm gonna set it right here.
Any takers?
10 grand on the line.
- Don't think about how
this took nine days.
And if you fall, it's all for nothing.
Like that.
- Let's see if David's luck continues.
I assume by your stance,
you do gymnastics.
- I do, yes.
- I can tell you look very calm.
All right, that's all you.
- It's wiggling.
- It's waggling.
- Why did we let a gymnast in this circle?
- He's counterbalancing.
- Oh, oh.
(cheering)
- David has so far won $19,000
without leaving this circle.
If anyone else, not named
David, wants to have a go.
Here's another $10,000.
And he's off there.
- Here's the bin.
- That's a good pivot.
That's a good pivot.
- How is everyone just robbing
me a money at the moment?
- I told you it was easy.
(cheering)
- Boys, boys, the balance beam's gotta go.
That did not go like I thought it would.
Here's what the circle
looked like at the start
with 100 people inside.
And this is what it looks
like now on day nine
with only 25 people.
By day 10 we decided to just
mess up the circle completely.
And at this point, our
luckiest contested, David,
had a really strange request.
You wanted your magic ball.
- I want to ask it if I
should get out right now
or if I should stick it through.
Magic eight ball, should I
leave the circle right now?
Oh, boy.
- Indications say yes.
Oh, it literally says yes.
(cheering)
Congratulations. You just
want another five grand
on top of the 19 grand you won.
Anyone else want to shake
the magic eight ball?
- No, we're good.
- He's literally walking away
with four briefcases of money.
- I'm just glad I could be a part of this.
- I'm glad you had fun.
Bring out the thing.
- The things coming.
- Majority of the
balloons have fun prizes.
Some of the balloons have punishments.
Punishments included
being double blindfolded
or having to wear a giant shoe.
- Chandler, which one should I go for?
- That one.
- You have to do a hundred
pushups before midnight.
- Yo, my bad.
- Other contestants got prizes.
You just want a go-kart.
You actually won $2,000.
Here you go.
Some contestants had a little
trouble with the balloons.
He won a blanket
- I can finally sleep.
- You're not worst than Classy.
- Yay.
You can have goldfish whenever you want.
Who actually likes goldfish?
- I do.
- You gotta tape your feet
to someone until the morning.
You have to sit on the tire
swing until the morning.
And now we are done with the balloon wall.
That was fun.
- Whoa.
- Remember if you touch
the ground, you're out.
- Sir, yes sir.
We're going through the night, baby.
We're gonna get this.
Wee.
- Another long night in the circle.
Let's see how they're holding up.
- Welcome to my crib.
I hate it here.
- It's 6:00 AM.
You can take your shoe off,
but I also have to take
the blanket and pillow.
- No.
I'm sorry.
- This is getting ridiculous.
Not even the tire swing
guy got out last night.
We need to make things harder.
There is 20 of you left
and I have 20 little circles of grass.
- That's not that much room.
- Exactly.
And all the remaining
contestants have 10 seconds
to get on one of them.
Boys, fill in the circle.
Everyone that gets out
in the next few minutes
I'll give you $10,000 in cash.
If not for the next 24
hours we're dropping it down
to two grand.
We're not doing anything
the rest of the night.
We're not really doing much tomorrow.
It's just standing.
I'd take a deal now while you can.
- How many minutes do we have?
- Like three or four?
Have fun.
- What an insane ultimatum.
- Nope.
- I ain't leaving.
- Are people gonna step out for 10
or are people gonna fight
it out for 24 hours?
We'll see.
This offer's going to go
away in three minutes.
You've been here so long.
- That's rough. That's rough.
- He's thinking about it.
- Will you throw in a PlayStation 5?
- For you, I'll throw it in PlayStation 5.
(cheering)
- William just stepped out.
- William just stepped out.
One step closer guys.
- We just lost will to the $10,000 offer.
- The smile on his face is so big.
- These people are tougher than I thought.
I wonder if any of them regret
not taking the 10 grand.
- I just don't know if I could
forgive myself if I took it.
- I should've have took 10,000.
Not the smartest decision,
but I'm not the smartest man.
- I wouldn't have left if
you didn't throw the PS5 in.
That's a fact
- The only thing we can
really do now is wait.
- Akira, you've been standing
for 10 hours straight now.
What's happening?
- Just can't take it anymore.
I gotta think about my future, so.
Goodluck, everybody.
- I've been standing for 18 hours.
I'm not having fun anymore.
- Mentally I'm still in it.
Physically I'm still in it.
- I just threw a whole bunch
of cold water on myself.
I just slapped myself like 20 times.
I am not going anywhere.
- All right, you guys see the laptop.
You see that blade of grass right there.
- I see that one.
- You got out literally by
a single blade of grass.
- Oh, he's falling.
(laughs)
- It has officially been
24 hours of standing.
How are you liking your little island now?
- It's pretty small.
- It's time to shrink them even more.
- Great.
- We got outlines of your feet.
As you can see, it's barely
bigger than his foot.
Everyone, you have 10
seconds to get on them.
We can just throw these away.
We're trying to get them
down to 10 contestants left.
Hopefully, this offer
scares the rest of them out,
and we can move on.
- If anyone gets out in
the next few minutes,
I'll give you $10,001.
You get an extra dollar
for staying another day.
Oh, he's already out.
Okay. We got one..
Oh, we got two takers.
I almost drop tank.
Oh we got another one.
Let's go.
(cheering)
Foy, Foy, Foy, Foy.
- Come on, Foy.
(cheering)
- We are now in the top 10 people.
You would think she just won
the half a million dollars.
Look around.
There are less than 10 people opposing you
and half a million dollars.
Goodluck.
One of you is winning this.
- I was dead tired before this,
but I'm 10 now.
I could do this for another two days.
- Closing in on the end of day 12.
And it's time for me to show you guys
why this question mark is here.
- Why is this question mark here?
- You're about to find out.
It is time I introduced the
plot twist of the century.
This video is actually two parts
and this was just part number one.
- No way.
- We're gonna be playing tag
to see which one of you actually wins
the half million dollar.
Contestants, make sure you get
a good night's rest tonight
because tomorrow will be
the most important day
of your lives.
If you haven't already
hit that subscribe button.
So in the next video,
you can see which one
of these people wins this
half a million dollars.
I'll see you then.
(Cheering)
♪ Mr. Beast 6,000, oh ♪"
hxwpkM5w3Cc,"- I tied up an FBI agent.
(words pop)
If he steals this hundred
thousand dollars from me
before midnight, he keeps it.
This is a knife.
Good luck. Let's go, Tareq.
- [The Boys] Oh, oh, what do we do?
- [Tareq] Oh my gosh, we gotta go.
- [Jimmy] Tareq, our first
stop's through the woods.
- [Tareq] Jimmy, why are we
doing this again already?
- Relax for one second.
I've been tied up before.
- [Chris] He's getting
so much time ahead of us.
- [Jimmy] We're coming out
the other side of the woods.
Our getaway car is over here.
- [Tareq] Whoa, that's a nice car, Jim.
- [Jimmy] The car matches my bag.
- [Tareq] We gotta go. We gotta go.
- [Chris] How are you gonna catch him
if your hands are tied?
- And now we drive down this path.
You guys have no idea what I
have in store for the boys.
I rented an NFL football
stadium, an island, a maze,
and tons of other cool things.
And stop!
- [Tareq] Oh! Why are we stopping already?
- Just watch.
You see this giant telephone pole?
- [Tareq] Uh huh.
- Watch this.
- [Tareq] Oh, oh, oh my gosh-
- Let's get back in the car.
(car revving)
- Buckle up.
- Now there's a giant telephone
pole blocking the exit.
- [The Boys] Oh.
- Oh, here we go.
- [The Boys] Hurry.
- Grab on. Push it over.
- Ohh!
- Push go.
- [Karl] Guys, hurry up!
- We put a GPS in my underwear
so the FBI agent and the boys
will always know where I'm at.
- [Nolan] Jimmy turned.
- [Chris] Oh, wait, he turned?
- [Nolan] He turned left.
- If you zoom in-
- It's a maze!
- It's a maze!
It gives us the layout of the maze.
- We're now at the Hedge Maze
and I got the hundred thousand dollars.
Look at how huge this maze is.
We gotta be careful because
it'd be easy to get lost
and for them to catch us in here.
- [Jimmy] Uh, I think it's this way.
- [Tareq] Okay...Uh, how do you know?
- I've done this maze like 10 times,
but the boys have never been here.
- We're just gonna push him and push him,
get him out of the area,
and then as he's tiring,
we'll handle this.
- I'm gonna leave them some money here
so they know they're going the right way.
Or a random person's
just gonna find a grand.
(Jimmy chuckles)
- [The Boys] Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
- [Nolan] It says open 11 to five.
- [Kurt] See if we can
actually get right through it.
- [Chris] Ooh.
- [Kurt] Here we go.
- [Jimmy] It was right,
right, left, right,
left, right, right, left.
Perfect. Okay.
If you're in the cave,
you're in the right spot,
which means if we go here,
now we are officially in the watch tower.
We can see the entire maze.
- I'm gonna do a perimeter check.
Make sure he is not outside.
We gotta find the getaway car.
- Hey Karl, come on.
- There's that nerd.
- Hey, there he is!
- Ooh!
- Okay!
- [Jimmy] I bet you can't get me.
- Ooh. The only exit is right here.
- [Chris] Why is there money over here?
- That was just to let you know
you were going the right way.
- [Chris] Jimmy, we're almost there.
Just wait.
- Oh, they are getting close.
Shoot, okay. We gotta go, we gotta go.
They're getting closer.
I don't know how long I
planned on staying there.
(Tareq laughs)
- [Chris] He's older than us,
but he's got so much more energy.
Isn't this where Jimmy was?
- [Kurt] Yes, it was.
- I know you're looking at this, Jimmy.
I'm taking your camera now.
- The only exit outside
of this entire maze
is all the way up there,
which is why yesterday
we put in a secret door.
- [Tareq] Oh wow. Jimmy, this is crazy.
Wait, Jimmy, is that our getaway car?
- Notice how this says,
""Authorized Maze Personnel Only"".
Now it says, ""Jimmy's Getaway Car"".
- [Kurt] Hey guys, let's
go back to the car.
The tracker's showing him up on the hill.
- [Karl] All right. To the car!
- [The Boys] Let's go!
- [Kurt] Let's go-
- [Karl] Go, go, go, go, go.
- [Nolan] Get in.
- I wonder if they've noticed
we're not in the maze anymore.
- [Nolan] He's getting on the highway.
- [Chris] Which way? Left or right?
- Right.
- Right.
- We can make all the
mistakes in the world-
- Doesn't matter-
- He's just gotta make one-
- He gotta make one.
- Yeah.
- Yo, there were parts where
we were so close to them
in the maze.
That was terrifying.
If they would've caught us there,
this video would've been
only like two minutes.
I made a mistake.
Tareq's supposed to be
driving. Let's switch.
- [Tareq] Let's switch.
- Karl is the, is that money real?
- Oh, it's real real.
- Oh good.
(boys laughing)
- And the reason Tareq is driving,
is because I need to put on a disguise.
(soft, exciting music)
I look so old.
Now we put the hat on, throw
on a pair of glasses, and boom.
I'm Boomer Jim.
And we're heading to Walmart
where I'm gonna try to
blend in with normal people.
- Do you think he went to the mall to shop
and we all go shopping?
- We're pulling up to Walmart
and I'm gonna go inside
with the hundred thousand
dollars and the tracker.
There's a pickax back here.
And while they're inside searching for me,
you need to pop all the tires
on their car to strand them.
- Jimmy, I've never
popped a tire in my life.
- Let's do this.
- [Chris] Wait. It says
we're on top of him-
- [The Boys] Hey!
- [Kurt] Yeah. It says
we're right on top of him-
- Take a, take a right down here-
- [Karl] He's right here.
- Don't let me down
with popping the tires.
- [Tareq] I won't. God speed.
- Park away from cars and
let's assess the situation.
- And now I'm inside Walmart.
And before I blend in, I
need to disguise this bag.
Now I'm gonna take the hundred
thousand dollar backpack
and put it in this bag.
Now they'll never catch me.
- You and I will go inside.
You two stay, stay together.
And let's see if we can search 'em out.
Inside! Hold his hand, there ya go.
- We're staying together.
(phone ringing)
- Are they here yet?
- They're walking out right
now. They're going inside.
- All right. They're going inside?
- Yes, yes, yes.
(phone call ends)
- The boys are about to
come inside. We gotta go.
- [Tareq] They have no idea
I'm gonna smash all their tires.
Look at 'em running.
- [Chris] Looking for a six foot four guy,
with a weird beard.
- I can literally see the boys
walking down the gaming aisle.
- I know that Jimmy told
me to pop all the tires,
but I'm just gonna do one.
Cuz I think I'm running low on time.
FBI? More like, FB flat tire!
(air hissing)
(Tareq running)
Oh, I gotta get the camera.
- He's not walking around
anywhere. He's gotta be hiding.
(phone ringing)
- [Jimmy] Did you do the deed?
- The deed is done.
- They're so close to me.
I'm getting outta here.
- [Tareq] Hurry up, grandpa.
- I can't believe that worked.
They were literally one
aisle beside me at one point.
- What's the tracker say?
- [Kurt] The tracker's
moving. The vehicle's moved.
- Wait, it's moving?
- In the parking lot?
- He's outta the...he's outta Walmart?
- It feels amazing to have that mask off.
We've knocked over a telephone pole,
had a goose chase through a maze,
and then hid in a Walmart as an old man.
And the video's just getting started.
I have so much more cool stuff planned.
Like I'm literally heading to the airport
to board a private jet right now.
- Wait a second!
- What's that?
Who popped our tires?
There's a pickax in our tire.
- Well, if we don't have a
car, we're gonna change a flat.
- [Nolan] Do you know
how to change a tire?
- Of course I know how to change a tire.
- [Chris] Remember you wanna go two or-
(car falling)
Yeah. That's why I don't like those jacks.
- [Kurt] Yep.
- Karl?
- [Karl] Yeah?
- Do you know where I
was hiding at Walmart?
- No!
- Basically I put on an old man suit,
changed my clothes, and used a cane.
Did you see a really old guy limping?
- I don't pay attention to old people.
- Well if you did see one
in Walmart, it was me.
Good luck, nerd!
(phone call ends)
- Brah!
(Chris groaning)
- [Nolan] Chris, you working hard?
- [Chris] You're hardly working.
- We're getting close to the airport.
I'm gonna call the private jet
and make sure they're ready.
- It looks like he's on a taxiing runway.
- He's gonna get in a plane and fly away.
- This is why he slashed the tires.
- And there's our private jet. Let's go.
I'm getting on a private
jet with the dumbest outfit
and a Cars backpack.
What am I doing with my life?
Come on. You're taking forever.
I'm gonna try to time it where
the private jet takes off
when they get here so they
can see me flying away.
- What's up, Jimmy?
- Hey buddy. How far away are you?
- We're at the Walmart
man. Still fixing the tire.
- Okay. Well-
- Hey Jimmy, if you had to
pick a terminal to go into,
would it be the passenger terminal?-
- Oh, so that means you're here.
Pilot, you can take off.
- [Chris] Run, run, run.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
(upbeat music)
- [Kurt] Last door.
- Later, nerds.
- That's him.
That's him on that jet right there.
- [Karl] Dude!
- I have no idea how they're
gonna track where we're going.
- We're gonna follow the airplane.
Let's check inside where it's going.
- Can we just do that?
- Yes. Why not?
- Oh. I guess he is FBI.
- How you doing? FBI.
Where did the airplane that
just left, where is it going?
- Uh. Washington, D.C..
(boys gasp)
- [The Boys] What!
- Wonderful.
- Is there another flight
to Washington, D.C.?
- [Kurt] Anytime soon.
- I don't see anything today. No.
- Do we have to drive all
the way to Washington, D.C.?
That's like-
- Hey, at least we got-
- Three hours!
- We gotta, we gotta new
tire for it. So we're good.
- New tire. Let's go.
- Private jet with stacks of money?
For the first time ever, I
actually feel like a YouTuber.
And now we're in Washington, D.C..
We got about a three hour lead.
And conveniently our driver is Nick.
You might remember him from this video.
He's so much nicer when
he's not chasing me.
- Ha ha! You ready to get outta here?
- Let's go.
- Let's go.
- Guys! He just landed in D.C..
- [Chris] What?
- [Karl] Actually?
- [Nolan] Yeah.
- That's over two hours away now still.
- Are we finally in Washington, D.C.?
- Holy cow-
- What does it say-
- Wait, Washington the state?
Cuz that would suck.
- And now we're at our
next location; the U-Store.
So like we talked about on the phone,
distract the boys, okay?
- Okay.
- He's right beside Costa Rica trading.
Whatever that is, it's right beside it.
- I just bought this storage locker
and I'm gonna put this sign
right here with this message:
""Time is running out. I was in the box.""
If that doesn't make any sense,
just gimme a few seconds.
- Maybe we can approach from the back.
- Hey, I tried that
with your mom one time.
(boys laughing)
- Me and you are gonna
hide in these boxes.
We're literally about
to get shipped alive.
- Jimmy, what is this?
What do you have me doing bro?
- Oh, that was probably
the worst drive ever.
- Ahhh!
- Karl. You stay here
and watch the vehicle.
Make sure no one pops our tire again.
- I'll sit right here.
- [The Boys] You're standing.
- I'm wondering if you've
seen this individual.
- Oh yeah, I saw him.
- Still around here?
- Yeah. I think he's downstairs.
Let me take you there.
- Downstairs!
- Downstairs?
- Downstairs?
- Should we just be
following random people
to their basement?
Is this okay?
I just don't understand why
all this is necessary, Jimmy.
- Let me get something to cut it.
Can you wait for me here, sir?
- Yeah.
- That truck you see
right here is my getaway.
I'm being transported right now.
Karl was right above us.
- Holy crap.
(blade cutting)
- [The Boys] This is so extra!
Hey, here we go.
- [Chris] ""Time is
running out. Karl sucks.
I was in the box.""
- Hey, hey. Check the tracker right now.
- [Chris] We're gonna have to go upstairs
to get service, to check.
- Are we free to get out?
- [Tareq] Um. Hold on. Not yet.
- I got Jimmy right here. He's gone.
He's long gone-
- Here's the thing.
There was a box truck when we got here.
He's gone in the box truck!
- [Karl] Guys! Where have you been?
- Come on. We just gotta go.
- I can't believe that worked.
Up next, we're going to a private island.
- Jimmy looks like he's crossed a bridge
and now going to a boathouse.
- Oh my goodness.
So we got a plane, a boat, a box truck.
What else is he gonna do?
- Thanks for the trip. Have a good day.
Even though that was really cool.
The box truck moves incredibly slow,
so they could be here any second.
What's up, man?
You ready to take us to the island?
Let's do this.
- Jimmy's calling. What's up, Jimmy?
- [Jimmy] Okay. What up, Chris?
Hey, how's it going?
You getting in a boat?
- No, actually I'm not.
- That's a nice pier you're at.
- Wait. Where are you?
- Maybe we might be about to
tackle you in about 10 seconds-
- Maybe I'm under-
- I hung up.
Look now we're turning the tables.
He thinks we're right
by him and we're not!
- Wait. I was calling him
to brag about the boxes,
but now I'm confused.
- [Karl] There are so many
boats here. What is going on?
- All right. There he is go, go, go, go.
- [Tareq] That's Karl. That's Karl.
- You nerd!
- [Tareq] They're coming!
- [Jimmy] Go, go, go.
- [Tareq] They're coming in strong.
- I got you some swan boats.
- It's always boats with you.
- Hey, get to pedaling
on your little swan.
- We'll go after him-
- Go.
- Go!
- We'll get in the next one.
- I'm gonna be honest.
I never tested those swans.
For all I know, they could be really fast.
- Wow. This is slow.
This is unreasonably slow.
- Did you ever chase
anyone on a swan before?
- This will be a first.
`- I'm gonna act like the boat broke.
Hey, Karl!
- Yes?
- My boat isn't working.
So I'd hurry up.
- His boat's broken.
Here's our chance. Hurry!
(boys grunting)
- This is the most
anti-climatic thing ever.
- [Tareq] Yeah.
- You got four hours left
until I keep the hundred grand.
See you later.
- You'll pay!
- And now we're at the island.
Hurry up, nerds!
- Come on over, let's talk.
The sun's not even down yet, my friend.
- They just docked.
- [Tareq] Go, go, go, go. They're close!
- [Chris] Hey, come on, guys.
- [Kurt] You're going right in.
You're fine.
- What the heck are we doing?
- I think we're lost.
We went the wrong way.
Oh where do we go? Please help us.
Help us. Help us.
We asked some people
on the island for help.
Cause to be honest, I'm lost.
- [Tareq] Me too.
- Jimmy, I will end you!
We're stuck. We're lost.
(indistinct)
Now we found a path. This has
to be where Jimmy's going.
- I only have three more hours here.
We need to get going here.
He's on the other side of the island.
- We make it outta here
without getting found,
then we're finally going
to the NFL stadium.
Are you subscribed?
- Uh yeah.
- [Tareq] Jimmy we don't have time.
- We always have time for this.
- [Tareq] That's fair.
- I don't care to fact check
you. Here's some money.
- Uh what?
- Thanks for subscribing. Now
I gotta run to regain my time.
- [Tareq] Yes!
- Guys?
What!
Kurt. There's nothing.
- We made it off the island
to our getaway vehicle.
And now it's time for my
favorite part of the video.
We're heading to an NFL
stadium that I rented.
- We should have never got on this island.
- Let's see where he is now.
- [The Boys] Oh, he's still driving?
- He's going towards Capitol Hill.
- I can't believe we rented
an entire NFL stadium.
Look at how huge this place is!
This is gonna be so much fun.
- [Karl] Let's get to our car. Come on.
We have like two hours left.
- I hate to break the bad news to you,
but it ain't a spa.
- What is it?
- A football stadium.
- He's at a football stadium?
- That sounds like running...
- I have a pre-recorded
video of me on loop
telling them they'll never find me.
""You'll never find me in this stadium.
Losers.""
Isn't that so funny?
And not only do I have
that video playing on loop,
but I've filled the
stadium with mannequins
so they'll think it's me.
They literally only have
two and a half hours left
to get this money.
- Let's go, go, go, go, go.
- Did he just rent an entire stadium?
Unbelievable. Let's see where he is.
So we have, he looks
like he's in the center.
- Wait, Jimmy's on the TV!
- [Chris] Aw.
- [Kurt] Oh no.
- [Chris] Come on.
- All right, I think
that's a little too much.
- Oh, he tortured me for a whole day here.
- Let's go get him.
- Let's go get him.
- Can we go catch him?
- Let's go get him.
- [Jimmy] ""You'll never
find me in this stadium-
- Holy cow.
- ""You'll never find me-
- [Kurt] Oh my Lord.
- [Nolan] Look at all the mannequins!
- As you can see, the boys
just walked into the stadium.
They're probably so confused.
Can you cut the audio for me please?
""You'll never find me in this stadium.""
Wait for it...
Boom. Now the audio's off. It's my time.
- How did this man-
- [Jimmy] Hello, boys.
- Hello?
- Hello?
- As you can see, there
is over 70,000 seats
and unlimited rooms in this stadium.
I need you guys to expect the unexpected.
Cuz, I could literally be anywhere.
And don't forget; you literally
only have two hours left
to win this hundred thousand dollars.
Good luck!
- This place is huge!
- What a jerk-
- Oh also, Karl's a nerd.
- [Karl] Stop man! What the heck!
(Jimmy laughing)
- Yo, this is so much fun.
- Hey, hey! I saw movement in that window-
- [Chris] He has to be in a box
where he can reach this mic-
- I swear I just saw movement.
- Nolan, what are you pointing at?
- I saw you! I saw movement!
- Wait, where is he pointing?
Turn to your left a little bit.
- I see him!
Run!
- [Chris] I told you he was in a box.
- And now they're coming
straight towards us.
- [Tareq] Why'd you do this?
- We should probably move.
- [Tareq] We should go.
(Tareq and Jimmy laughing)
- [Chris] He's on the run!
- And now we're heading out the back way.
And the cool part is, they
don't know what the back way is.
Good luck, nerds. I believe in you.
- Hey guys, over here!
- He just called the boys!
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
- Second level. He is moving around.
- [Nolan] Kurt!
- He's going that way.
- [Nolan] How do we get up there?
- This way! Escalators.
- [Jimmy] Let's go up.
- [Tareq] Let's just go up?
- [Nolan] Oh no! They're not working!
(intense music)
That's Jimmy!
- [Jimmy] It's Nolan!
- Hurry, it's Jimmy!
- Tareq! Sacrifice yourself!
- [Tareq] Sacrifice myself?
- Yeah.
- [Tareq] He went that way.
- [Nolan] No, he didn't, there's a door!
Get out of the way, Tareq!
Where'd he go? Where'd he go?
- Here's my strategy.
I'm gonna go fake pose like a mannequin
and pray they don't find me
for the next hour and a half.
Okay?
They've seen what I'm wearing.
So I'm gonna steal this
mannequins clothes.
Do I look like a mannequin?
- Jimmy, come on out and play.
- I know he's one of the
mannequins over there.
Let's pretend like we don't know that.
These stupid mannequins, man.
Where is this nerd?
- [Chris] If I was Jimmy,
where would I hide?
- [Nolan] Kurt? Kurt.
- [Tareq] Jimmy, go, go, go, go.
- [The Boys] Yes! Let's go!
- Honestly, I've been
running for like 14 hours.
When he was right there, I was like,
I don't feel like getting tackled.
He can just have the money.
What are you gonna spend
the hundred grand on?
- I'm gonna spend it on my wife.
- Really?
- I'm gonna make sure that
my family is enjoys it.
- Aw-
- that's the important thing-
- That's really sweet.
- One of the best
experiences I've ever had.
- In our last video, I mentioned
that every single person
that buys this executive
producer shirt or hoodie
will get their name at
the end of this video,
which is why you see names on
the left side of your screen.
Because that is every single person
that purchased this shirt or hoodie.
And I didn't tell you
guys I would do this,
but on top of that,
we also wrote every
single one of your names
on the wall of my studio.
Literally every day,
when I come in to film,
I'm gonna see your name on this wall.
Like Peter Wild, when I film,
I'm gonna be reminded of you.
And same with Knox and
Knox Tucker and Koda
and Koda G and all these Michaels.
And on top of that,
Chandler, bring it on in.
I also got all your
names put on this Tesla.
That's right. Not only are all
your names on my studio wall,
but your names are also on this Tesla.
And this is the fun part.
Chandler, I want you to pick
a random name on this Tesla
and we're gonna give it to
them in like 30 seconds.
All right, let's do it.
Matt Liggett.
- [Jimmy] What about him?
- [Chandler] He didn't win.
- [Jimmy] Oh, he didn't win?
Well, tell me when you have the winner.
- Hey Jimmy, you have
Peyton Chicken Nugget
as one of your fans.
- Can you investigate that?
See if that's their real name.
- I'm thinking probably not.
- Derpyfish, 89.
I told you to use your real name,
but I didn't actually fact check it.
You go in the S category.
There's a bunch of Sponge Bobs.
And I know your names aren't SpongeBob.
- Jimmy!
- Yeah?
- Tell me when to stop.
- Uh, wait for it, now stop.
- Oh. Which finger?
- I'm a pinky kinda guy.
- Alexander Hedge, this Tesla...
- [The Boys] Yeah! All right-
- I don't know if that made any sense.
Congratulations, Alexander.
You just won a brand new Tesla.
Sorry that it's covered in names.
If you want, you can remove 'em.
Thank you so much.

(fire exploding)"
ktyJIj6i4Qw,"- This is a never ending
giant mountain of cash.
And as much cash as you can carry,
you can keep.
I don't care if you put in your pockets,
in your hoodie, in your
pants, in your shoes.
- When do I go?
- Now.
- Now?
- It starts now.
- Oh my God, what can I
do with all this money?
- Stuff it in every crevice you got.
- I need you to stand up,
it's as much cash as you can carry.
Do you want to keep adding more money?
Like we can add a $5 bill there,
we can add a $5 bill here.
- Okay.
- You can add a $5 bill here.
- We can add a couple.
Let's stop.
- This is like, two grand,
you sure you don't want me to put it down?
- Oh, oh yeah, go right ahead.
- Yeah? You want that?
- All right, I think you should stop.
- All right. I'm gonna stop.
- Oh, oh!
- Stop.
- Yo, you stopped it just in time!
- Nice! Yes!
- According to the scale, you have $6,751.
- [Everyone] Yeah!
- I love taking out the trash.
- This is our waitress.
As much money as you
can stack on this tray,
without putting it down, you can keep.
But, you do this and it falls,
you lose it all.
- All of it?
- All of it.
- Wow.
- You've been a waitress for five years,
what's the biggest tip you've ever gotten?
- Like 200.
- Nice. Well, here's that.
- I know. (laughs)
- And here's that again.
So this right here,
will put you at $8,000.
- [Chandler] So much money, right.
- Okay.
- What's the number where you stop?
- Honestly, I don't even have a number.
I'ma just keep goin' and see.
- You're scaring me.
Oh my gosh, it's so high.
- I'm scaring myself.
- You can call this at any point,
just let us know when
you want, to call it.
- Put on, put on one more.
- Okay, one more? Okay.
- Oh God.
- By one more,
did you need three more?
- And then another one on top.
- Oh my God.
- Why don't ya call it.
Please call it, call it!
- Okay! Okay, okay.
I call it, call it, I call it.
- Call it!
- You're done
- Are you done? Okay.
She's done, she's done. All right.
And while we were doing this,
a few of her coworkers were
watching from the kitchen.
And I felt kind of bad, so I invited them
to our warehouse and
surprisingly, they followed me.
Don't follow strangers, kids.
As much money as you can put in those bags
in the next minute, you can keep.
- Beautiful.
- Yes.
- That's what I'm talking about.
- 58, 57, 56, there's 55 seconds left.
(paper rustling)
(Host laughing)
He just dove! Kind of
hilarious that I just literally
met them like five minutes ago.
And now we're doing this.
- You need help, sir? And ma'am?
- I forgot to turn on a timer.
So 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
All right, time is up.
Time is up.
And that's your boss, right?
Can I just talk to him?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Sorry for stealing your employees.
I let them fill up bags with money.
- [Boss] Can I get my employees back?
- Of course, I'll send them back.
Do you want a bag of
money with your employees?
- [Boss] That'd be good.
- Can I trust you not to steal this
and give it to your boss?
- [Employee] You can.
- Okay.
Have fun.
There's $50,000 in these two duffel bags.
Can I have your camera?
And, and can I have your camera as well?
Yeah. Can you hold these?
Can each of you pick up
one of these duffel bags?
- [Timmy] Wait, why is it so heavy?
- Money weighs a lot.
That is 50 pounds worth of money.
And that is 50 pounds worth of money.
And whichever one of you
sets your duffle bag down first, loses it.
But you still have to
film the entire video.
- [Tareq] Timmy, you're going down.
- [Timmy] Heck no, man.
- This is the strongest man in the world.
- Slight correction.
- Yeah?
- Four times World's Strongest Man.
- Strongest Man in the world, four times!
We hooked up this Camaro, to
a deadlift bar right here.
And if you can deadlift
this car, you can keep it.
- Are you confident that I can do it?
- You're kind of bigger than
me and the boys combined.
Let's see if we can deadlift it.
3, 2, 1.
(All groaning)
- Hey, it moved a little.
- If me and the boys can't
lift it, I don't know.
- This is definitely a real car, and-
- It goes.
- It does.
(horn honking)
- Horn works.
- I don't know the average
weight of a Camaro,
but Editor, Google it and put it here.
Can four time, World's Strongest
Man, deadlift this Camaro?
(Strongman groaning)
- Yeah! (hands clapping) I got it! Woo!
- Why don't both of you,
get in the front seats?
- Can I hop in too?
- Yeah, a hundred percent.
- Oh. Oh.
- Aah, we're moving!
- Woo!
- Yeah! Another one.
(energetic music)
- Make it 10!
- Yeah!
(Strongman groaning)
- The moment you've all been waiting for.
Do you fit in your car?
- It's like a glove. Here we go.
- All right, all right.
- (laughing) You're too huge.
- Go for it.
- Let's see if we can
close the door.
- Yep.
- All right. (clapping)
Never did I think it'd be harder
for someone to sit in a car,
than it is for them to lift a car.
We're gonna go to the next bit.
We have basically unlimited iPhones here
and a tiny rectangle.
As many iPhones, as you
can fit in this rectangle-
- Hmm.
- you can go
as high as you want, you can keep.
This what you're playing for.
- Yeah.
- Brand new iPhones,
never been used, never been opened.
- Oh, so I can just like
chuck this one, right?
Just like, boom.
- I mean, yeah.
Just kick it as well.
- Yeah, man, let's go,
just get me a new one.
- I didn't tell him to kick his phone.
And each one of these iPhones,
cost around a thousand dollars.
9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, so far.
- Do you feel confident?
- Oh, how could I not, man?
Do you not see this stack?
I got you, I got me.
- Oh, I.
- Do vertical.
- Vertical?
- Did, I don't remember.
If this falls over,
you get nothing, right?
I mentioned that.
- Oh.
- Did I not mention that?
- You didn't, but it's all good.
- Oh okay. Yeah.
- It's all good.
You gonna help?
- Yeah. Tareq, I feel like
you're holding that camera
a little low, you wanna, you
wanna raise it up a little bit?
- Yeah. Hold on.
Let me raise this up first.
- Think I might be done here.
- 31 iPhones.
- Whoa. There we are, baby.
- Are you sure?
Are you sure you wanna stop?
- We're gonna go for one more.
Gotta get an even number on there.
- 32, right?
- Oh. You don't see that?
- It's not shaking. It's not shaking.
- Here. You know, just
add, just add another one.
- We're good. We're done, we're done.
We did it!
- This is, okay.
32 iPhones, congratulations!
- We did it, we did it!
(All laughing)
- I dunno what to do with 30 iPhones.
But I got 'em. Can't complain.
- Frank, as much money
as you can bench press,
you can keep, put whatever the
heck you want in that basket.
This right here's a stack
of a thousand dollars.
Boom. Now, if you bench
press that you make a grand.
How am I supposed to
know how much it weighs?
You don't.
(Frank laughing)
I feel like you can bench
press at least 10 grand.
- Okay, that makes sense.
- That's two.
That is $10,000 in the basket.
- Oh my gosh!
- We gotta put 10,000 on this side.
- It only makes sense.
- You now have $21,000 on this other bar.
- This is a lot of money.
- 22,000. Are you sure
you don't want more?
- Yeah, I think that's fine, you know?
- I mean, if it's all you want.
You can literally put a hundred
grand on it if you wanted.
- I could, but then I'd
walk away with nothing.
- Frank, let's go!
- Gosh, ah!
- Let's make it two reps.
Two reps.
- Whoa, whoa. (claps)
- Hey, okay.
- Well one rep
seems a little too easy.
- One, two. Good.
(Frank panting)
Hold on to it.
Stabilize.
- I'm gonna lower to one rep
- Stabilize!
- I can't do it.
- So he can't do it.
- Frank push!
- He's definitely not helping.
- Push!
- Whatsoever.
(Frank yelling)
- Finish!
- Since he had to help you,
I'm gonna confiscate this one.
You don't get this one.
You can have that one though.
- Yay.
- All right, Frank.
- If I learned one thing
it's that money is heavy.
- [Tareq] Oh, you think?
- [Timmy] Yeah. Yeah, it's a pretty heavy.
- You think?
- I would say so.
- What you had to bench,
they've been carrying around all shoot.
How you guys doing?
Five hours in baby?
(laughing)
- Easy money. Easy.
- Yeah?
Easiest five hours of your life?
- Um...
- Hmm...
- I'd be lying to you if I said yes.
You know the deal, as much as
you can carry you can keep.
- I'm stuffing my pants.
- Did you just wear tube socks today?
- Of course.
- That's not enough,
I want more!
- I'm going in the legs man.
- Come on.
- I never thought we'd be filming
Chris stuffing Nolan's pants.
- Nolan, I'm going deep.
- Chris is having a little too much fun.
- Ah, that one hurt.
- Yeah? (cackles)
- Here's the money mountain,
and conveniently right here
is a laser obstacle course.
At the end of that laser obstacle course,
is keys to a car.
And you can attempt to win the car,
but if you touch a laser or drop a dollar,
you lose all your money.
- I'm down.
- You sure?
- I'm doing it.
- Nolan. Let's see it.
(Nolan groaning)
(All cheering)
- Oh no!
(All screaming)
- Oh no.
(money crashing)
♪ In the eyes ♪
- I know you're sad and all,
but gimme my money back.
- How?
No!
(All giggling)
- Next we went to a jeweler
and told our contestant
that as many rings as she
could fit on her finger,
she can keep.
- Here you go, just slide
that on that finger.
(bell dinging)
- Huh! I don't know if we
want her to put this one on.
This was $7,300.
- Well, if it fits, she's got to.
- She ended up fitting so
many rings on her finger
and it added up to be $25,000.
- The rings on her finger,
cost the same as the money
you've been lugging all day.
- She lifted $25,000 with one finger?
And you have to do it like this?
You're so weak Tareq.
- Jimmy, can I just do this with rings?
- No.
- This is a pool full of Orbeez.
And inside these vacuum sealed bags,
there's $10,000.
(bell ringing)
Adam, you're probably wondering,
why are you in a pool of Orbeez?
- Why am I?
- I hid a hundred thousand dollars
at the bottom of this pool.
And I think you know
where I'm going with this.
- I think I know where I'm going.
60 seconds to
win a hundred grand, go.
- Okay. Whoa.
- Oh my God,
he went straight down.
- Wait, did you find it?
- Oh wow.
- Okay, great.
Throw it out the pool.
60 seconds, find out if there's anymore.
- Keep going!
(Orbeez splashing)
(gasping)
- Oh, down in my toe, right.
- Yeah!
- 20 grand.
- I keep stubbing my toe right here.
- Yeah?
- It really hurts.
- I'm still, oh!
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, he grabbed me!
- I grabbed a toe!
- [All] Yeah!
(All laughing)
- No.
- Guy got another one.
- He found another one!
- I'll take it,
you just keep searching!
(All laughing)
(screams)
- Hand it off, hand it off!
- 5, 4, 3, 2, 1!
Time's up, time's up!
Play it in slow-mo?
(yelling)
(timer buzzing)
- Pretty sure it didn't leave the pool.
- What?
- Congratulations
on winning 40 grand, could've been 50-
- Woo!
- if Chris was
a little faster.
- We did it again, baby!
- So excited.
We're here, oh God!
- In this box right here is a Rolex.
Chandler and Chris are gonna Sumo wrestle.
And if you predict which one will win,
I'll let you keep this.
- He looks like he's a
little bit more scrappier
but he's got like, he's got a
little bit more edge to him.
Nah, we're going with this one.
- This one, this one right here.
- Yep.
- Okay. And now
that we know who he's
picking, let's take these off.
- I can hear.
- Gentlemen.
Are you ready for this guys?
- Ah! It's so bright.
- Gentlemen, I want a good clean fight.
First one to fall over or
leave the circle is out, okay?
Our contestant over here
has a Rolex on the line
and you two also have
something on the line.
- We do?
- The winner's Mom gets 10 grand.
- Oh, nice.
- Go! Show us how much you love your Moms.
(fighters grunting)
- That Rolex is nice.
- Oh, oh, oh!
- You might need to push.
- Go Chandler, go!
- Go, c'mon man!
- Oh man!
(Both yelling)
(bomb exploding)
- Not only did your Mom get $10,000,
but he also got a Rolex
'cause he picked you.
- Yeah, all right.
- Shot bro.
- We're currently in
a Sumo wrestling ring.
Do you guys wanna keep
carrying these bags around?
Or do you just wanna,
you know, wrestle it out?
I don't know, it's up to you Timmy.
I'd like to wrestle.
- Let's wrestle.
- Both our fighters here
have 25 grand on their backs,
they've been carrying around for like,
eight hours now, right?
Touch gloves, get to your corners.
- $25,000. Go, go!
- Go Timmy!
- Ah!
- Oh, Tareq's running. Oh!
- Tareq, what are you doing?
- Tareq, Tareq!
- What is he doing?
- Tareq!
- 25 grand!
- Yeah!
- Woo! Come on.
- Tareq, you might have just lost $25,000.
But at least every time
they watch this video here,
you make money.
- Yes guys, please watch this video."
urtFrxDUV6c,"- We are at a high school
and I'm about to offer this
student $100,000 to drop out.
We worked with her mom and her teacher,
and she has no idea
we're about to interrupt
her summer school lessons,
with a $100,000 in cash.
- [Chris] Oh.
- Let's see if she answers
the trick question correct.
Hey, do you mind if we interrupt?
Have you ever heard of
the channel, MrBeast?
- I have.
- Okay, this will make
this so much easier.
Boys bring in the a $100,000.
- [Chris] Hello.
- Would you drop out of high school
for $100,000 in cash?
(suspenseful music)
- Why not?
- Because I can still
make money going to
college and get a career.
- I agree, which is why this
is actually a trick question.
And if you said yes, I
wouldn't have given you money,
but since you said, no,
you just won $100,000.
Here's $20,000
- 40,000, it's so heavy.
Don't let it fall on her.
- [MrBeast] Oh, don't cry.
- Thank you so much.
- No problem.
We'll just all cry.
This is a Lamborghini.
And Neil, if you can parallel
park this Lamborghini
between these two Teslas,
I'll let you keep it.
- This is too easy, bro.
- You seem pretty confident.
- I'm from New York,
we're raised on parallel parking.
I don't need these anymore.
- Are these the keys to your car?
- Yeah, man, I don't need them,
I'mma drive home in this.
I got this.
Here to go.
- Oh wait Neil, wait, wait.
I forgot to mention,
if this Lamborghini touches
one of these Teslas,
he loses it.
All right, keep going.
If he parallel parks this
Lamborghini right here,
he keeps it.
This is terrifying.
- I'm good right here.
- You're good, you're good.
(suspenseful music)
- Oh! Neil!
- Neil, do you know how expensive-
- Stop, don't hit the other car.
Turn the car off!
- I don't know how!
- Neil, I think I need your car keys back,
'cause this is our next contestant.
Let's see if Ivette can
parallel park a Lamborghini.
Karl, can you get in and her teach her?
- That button, way over there is reverse.
- This one?
There's not like a prindle?
- No, I use paddles.
- Paddles?
- I don't know.
- This is gonna be awhile,
so we'll find out later in the video
if she wins the Lambo.
I have over 100 different
watermelons in this field.
And this is a check for $1 million.
Ah, oh.
- [Karl] Whoa, that was kind of perfect.
- Okay, boom.
There is now a check for $1
million inside this watermelon.
- Jay, you are surrounded
by over 100 watermelons.
One of these watermelons
has a check for $1 million
inside of it.
You get to bash one single watermelon.
And if you bash the one
with $1 million in it,
you become a millionaire.
- All right, I'm gonna find it.
I'm gonna find that one melon.
There's big melons, there's little melons.
There's green ones and yellow ones.
- [Karl] This is sounding
like a Dr. Seuss book.
- I have no idea what melon to pick here.
I see some footprints next to this one,
I don't know.
- Jay's studying our
footprints of the sand.
He's analyzing the stems.
- Choices, choices, choices.
- Pick the watermelon you're smashing.
- No, no, no, no.
- Get away from me,
I'm not a watermelon.
- This is my million.
- [MrBeast] That's it.
- Look, it's all shiny.
You're gonna make me a
millionaire, MrBeast.
(dramatic music)
- [MrBeast] Oh, hit it.
- $1000.
- $1000
- I'll take $1000 from a watermelon.
- If you would've went 10
watermelons to your right,
that's $1000.
- There it is.
- You would've saw this $1 million check.
Can you confirm it says $1 million?
- That does save $1 million.
- The only thing that stood
between you and $1 million,
was 10 watermelons.
If you punch this bag,
it will rate how hard your punch was.
So naturally, I grabbed three
of the strongest men I know
and Chandler.
- Hey.
- And whichever one of them
scores the highest gets $30,000.
- Easy money, yes!
- I say we start with the biggest guy.
- I'm about the Falcon punch this thing.
- Probably should have tested it.
- [MrBeast] 300, 400.
- Oh my gosh.
- 902 on the dot.
I would say the next
biggest person is Noah.
- Come on, Noah!
(all screaming)
- So far, the money is yours.
Let's see if Sean can change that.
This is Sean, my bodyguard.
Act like this is someone
trying to assault me.
No, Sean saved me,
punch the bag.
You can buy a lot with-
- Oh!
- [Announcer] Oh, that's a miss.
- The score didn't go up,
so technically it doesn't count
Sean.
Oh, that looks like a good hit.
Oh, no.
As of now, this $30,000 in cash is yours.
The only man in the world
that can take it away from you
is Chandler.
Chandler, I know you hate pickles,
I'm gonna put it right there.
Take your hit.
He's pulling on his crack head string.
Oh wow, you scored better than Sean,
but not higher than Floyd.
Congratulations, you just won $30,000!
- I punch hard, and it helped.
Now I can get my wisdom teeth out.
- Back at the parking lot,
Ivette was really taking her
time parking this Lamborghini.
She literally spent over two
hours strategizing with Nolan,
but she does have until the end
of the day to complete this,
so we're gonna go give away
more money in the meantime.
And now we're back in
a high school classroom
with Mr. Hughes.
- That's me.
- Have a seat right here, sir.
- How the tables have turned.
- And this is professor Chandler.
- Hi.
- This is the history book
you teach your high school students.
- That is a textbook we use.
- Chandler's gonna pick a
random question from this book
and if you get it right,
we'll give you $10,000 in cash.
- Okay.
- Chandler, go ahead and
flip through the book.
Flip.
The cold war.
The Soviet Union views NATO as a threat.
In response, the Soviets
developed an alliance system
in 1955 as a part of their
own containment policy.
It was known as the?
- Warsaw pact.
- Dang.
- He got it.
Congratulations, you just won $10,000.
Now here's the thing,
do you wanna risk this
$10,000 that you just won
for a chance at $20,000?
- Sure.
I know this book front
and back, no problem.
- As a teacher, he should.
This time, we have professor
Karl with $20,000 on the line.
The Aztecs control Central Mexico.
What is a hard, glassy green or black rock
found in the valley of Mexico
and used to make razor sharp weapons?
- Obsidian.
- That does say obsidian,
which means he just won another $20,000.
- I picked that 'cause of Minecraft.
- Now obviously your cashflow
is getting pretty big.
That's $20,000.
Do you wanna risk your
20 grand for shot at 30?
- We'll give it a shot.
- It's time to get serious.
I'm gonna pick an extremely hard one.
- Oh, he's really good at that!
- Around 520, an Italian
monk began writing a book
describing a strict, yet
practical set of rules
for monasteries.
Who wrote?
- Benedict of Nursia.
- Wait, he got it right?
- Let's go!
- Congratulations, you
just won 30 grand in cash.
I studied Benedict in
monastery for three years.
- How was I supposed to know that?
- It pays to be a good teacher
and know your textbook.
- Thank you very, very much.
- This is $20,000 in cash.
- It's real.
- You can split it 50 50
with a random stranger,
or you can steal it and walk
away with all $20,000 in cash.
Any questions?
- Is there a catch?
- There's no catch.
- There's no catch at all?
- No catch at all.
- I wanna steal it then.
- Okay, well that was quick.
- There's no catch at all?
- Just one old man is
really sad right now.
- Wait, what?
- The guy that lost out on 10
grands gonna be watching this.
- Wait, I'm so sorry.
- What do you have to say now?
- I didn't know!
- But you did know.
- I thought there was gonna be catch!
- And boom, all $20,000.
All right, have a good day.
- You too, thanks.
- Would you have split the
$20,000 with someone random?
A person you've never
met in your entire life.
- If thought they needed it,
yeah, I would have.
- What a nice guy,
now I feel kind of bad.
Luckily, we're gonna invite him
to be back in a future video,
so don't worry,
we're not completely screwing him over.
Next bit.
Don't forget to watch the end
to see if she wins this
expensive Lamborghini.
This is $20,000 in cash,
and this is a mountain of candy.
And this is Chris's son, Tucker.
- I made this.
- Chris, I think you see
where I'm going with this?
- Pick the money, boy.
- Put Tucker dead in the middle,
right here.
- Okay, we've been working on this.
Tucker step, step, step.
- [MrBeast] Oh, he knows how to walk now.
- Go, go, go, go.
- This is a bunch of money.
- Yeah, that's a lot of money.
- This is a bunch of candy.
Candy? Money?
Which one do you want?
- [Voiceover] Huh?
- Tucker, follow the money trail.
Woo!
- Two can play that game.
- No, candy's gross.
It's bad for your two teeth.
- Tucker literally didn't
move for almost 45 minutes.
Honestly, Tuck, if you picked the money,
I wouldn't even care at this point.
Just pick one or the other.
- He said, ""okay, light.""
Go, and let's go.
We gonna crawl, come on.
Peek a boo!
- It was never a fair
challenge to begin with.
- Peek a boo!
- [MrBeast] He pulled out the peek a boo.
- [Chris] When does it count?
- I don't know.
He's just grabbing the lights.
We'll just uh.
Oh wow!
He touched the money!
- [Chris] Whoa!
- [MrBeast] Good job, Tucker.
- Also, I'm gonna give you some of this.
We're gonna take one of those lights home?
- Tucker, the world wants to know,
are you happier about the
20 grand or this light?
You heard it here folks.
Thank you, Tuck.
Next bit.
- It's literally like nothing
changed since we left.
- We've been doing this so long,
it's almost outta gas.
- Wait, really?
I'm gonna give you until this
Lamborghini runs outta gas.
- Look at me real quick.
I believe in you.
- At least someone believes in me.
Should I go?
- [Karl] She's going.
- She's gone.
- I'm so scared.
- You got this.
- Tiny bit more.
Stop, stop, stop!
Oh my gosh.
It is less than an inch away.
If you shook the car right now,
it would hit the Tesla.
- What is that, like an inch and a half?
Inch and a half.
She's gonna have to fully
commit to one of them.
- I know.
- Commit to this one,
and then keep readjusting.
- Ready?
- Stop, stop, stop!
No!
Did it hit?
- [Ivette] No it didn't,
I'm gonna cry.
- We think she hit the Tesla.
Play the clip.
If this piece of paper
can't fit between the cars,
they're touching.
- No, no, no!
- They're definitely touching.
She didn't win the Lamborghini.
Can you break the news to her?

nM89Wl03Q4g,"- [Jimmy] This is a real prison
and me and the boys are
gonna try to survive
the next 50 hours locked up here.
- Get in here,
put your hands against the wall.
- There against the wall.
I'm just gonna do what he says.
I am officially locked
in prison with Nolan.
How's it going?
- Not good.
- Basically me, Nolan and
all my other friends agreed
to spend 50 hours in prison.
How's it going, boys?
- I feel right at home.
- Just so we're clear.
We are gonna be treated
exactly like inmates.
Okay, we're gonna be
eating real prison food.
We're gonna have to mop
and clean the prison
and all around subjected
to the mental warfare
that is being a prisoner.
I hope you guys are ready.
First thoughts on my brand new
bed, it's very uncomfortable.
These sheets, oddly feel like...
Hey, get your foot off my bed.
(Nolan giggling)
(Jimmy groans)
49 hours and 55 minutes to go
and I'm already sick of him.
- What?
(Jimmy laughs)
- I would like to discuss the toilets.
What are your thoughts on them?
- I'm not gonna lie, mine
has like a yellow tint to it.
- That's what I was about to ask.
Now that we've established,
the toilets are disgusting.
Let's all taste test the fountain.
(Jimmy grunts)
There was something in it.
Look at all that stuff.
I'm just not gonna drink water.
I'll just die.
(clock ticking)
- Last name, inmate.
- Weddle.
- Doyon. (Zealous chuckles)
- What kind of last name is that?
- I'm French-Canadian, all right.
- My last name?
- Yes.
- Imagine dragon.
- I'm gonna back up.
- Imagine dragon theses
nuts, on your face.
(inmates laughing)
- I'll be back for you guys.
(Nolan laughing)
- Hey, it's him, I'm not doing it.
- I'm not scared, come get us.
Get him too.
- Lights out.
- Do we have to get in our bunk?
- Lights out, get in your bunk.
- About to spend the night in prison.
It feels like I took a blanket
and just laid it in
the middle of the road.
This is gonna suck.
It's currently 3:00 a.m. and in prison,
the guards do roll call
in the middle of the night
to make sure no prisoners escaped.
(alarm wailing)
- Roll call!
State your name.
- [Noah] Noah.
- [Guard] State your name.
- [Jimmy] Jimmy.
- Nolan.
(head bumps)
(Nolan grunts)
- [Jimmy] Did you just hit your head?
- Have a good night ladies.
I'll see you guys in the morning.
- Wake up ladies.
Five minutes, get out of bed.
Dress, ready to go.
- Slept like a baby.
If the baby got hit by a truck
in the middle of the night.
- These things are constricting.
- [Guard] Over here, face to the wall.
- I feel like I actually
did something illegal now.
Oh, this is hard, okay.
Oh, is this the kitchen?
What's that?
- Food.
- Okay.
This is my first prison meal.
(suspense music)
Not bad.
I give the meal a four out of 10.
Raise your hand if you're glad
you're at least not in your cell.
He's a psychopath.
- Yeah, I couldn't sleep last night
and this wasn't worth waking up for.
(upbeat music)
- And we're back to the
cells, that was a journey.
(clock ticking)
- Shower time.
(inmates whooping)
- [Zealous] Why does he
have latex gloves on?
- It's for the cavity search.
- I've never taken a prison shower before.
- [Guard] Towel,
underwear, shirt and soap.
You have 10 minutes.
- Ooh.
- So they're letting us take showers now
but there's no hot water.
That really seems like torture to me.
- Brush teeth.
- What kind of sorry excuse-
- I had too many stabbings
with toothbrushes.
- of a toothbrush is this?
- Stabbings?
What kind of prison is this?
How am I supposed to brush my teeth?
I'm gonna get a cavity.
- Inmate coming out of shower.
Inmate out of shower.
- [Jimmy] What's on your finger?
- This is a toothbrush,
look at this thing.
- [Jimmy] Oh really?
- [Nolan] What is this?
- Oh,
I dropped soap.
(all laughs)
That wasn't on purpose.
Hey fellow inmates,
we have officially survived
10 hours in prison.
(inmates cheering)
- [Jimmy] We were all just taking naps
and relaxing peacefully in ourselves,
and then this happened.
- Rec time!
Come on up.
Get up.
(metal clanking)
Wake up, wake up!
- Looks like it's time for rec.
All right, let's see what
we're dealing with here.
A crappy chessboard.
We've got a nice TV and we
have a beautiful library here.
Does everyone here know
how to play poker, yeah?
- Yes.
- You guys wanna wager something on game?
- [Zealous] I have nothing.
- [Jake] I have no money.
- [Jimmy] While, we were
having fun playing cards.
The other inmates got jealous
and tried to start a riot.
- It feels like y'all
been in there forever.
- [Neil] I swear Chris.
- [Darren] Yeah, let's go.
- It's already been an hour,
there's no way it hasn't been an hour.
- [Jimmy] Hey, we're just having fun.
- Let us out!
(inmates grunting and screaming)
- It's been like 12 hours
and already is upset.
- [Darren] Hey,
we got a little bit of a
plumbing issue over here.
- [Jimmy] Darren, what did you do?
- You made us do it, man.
- To your cell, to your cell.
- They're not letting us out.
They're showing favoritism over here.
- You were next.
- Yeah, got tired of waiting man.
- These guys tried to
literally flood the prison
and then get mad when they get cuffed.
- [Neil] This prison sucks.
- [Jimmy] I think you
should put them in solitary.
- [Neil] Jimmy!
- I want this floor to be
eaten off by time you're done.
- [Jimmy] You can't even mop
'cause you're in shackles.
That looks horrible.
- Good behavior leads to good rec time.
Bad behavior leads to this.
- I woke up for rec and nobody's in here.
You know, everybody got in trouble
so I guess I'm just gonna
look at pictures and books.
- [Jimmy] Nolan and I woke up to learn
that we're on kitchen duty
which means we had to
make food for everybody.
- Here we go.
Oh, we get cosmic brownies.
- I love prison.
(intense music)
Is that the cell mates?
- Jimmy, you cooked?
- Yeah, that's pretty good.
We have tons of beans.
Everyone here is getting lots of beans.
Wait, how many beans are you putting on?
- [Nolan] Darren was hungry!
- [Guard] All right, let's get moving.
- I asked for no mayo.
- [Jimmy] We sat down to eat
our very bland prison meal.
And at this point we were so bored
that we started gambling our brownies.
- [Jake] I already got nine pair.
- [Jimmy] Oh, give me a
10 and I got a straight.
(Chris clapping)
(inmates cheering)
So this is my brownie.
- This is ring!
- I just won so many brownies.
- [Guard] Inmates line up.
(upbeat music)
(bell dings)
- Inmates line up!
Hit the wall, face the wall.
- We're getting cuffed up again.
I assume that's normal
every time we leave.
- [Guard] All right,
we're doing cell checks.
- What does the cell check mean?
- We are searching your
bunks to find any contraband.
So anything we find will be a ride up
and possibly solitary
depending on what it is.
- We've only been here for 20 hours.
What's the worst they could
possibly have in their cells?
- What is that?
Nolan got a knife!
- It was only for protection.
- I think you should search his butt.
- No! Not my butt.
- He's going to solitary.
(suspense music)
- Take me back, let me go outside.
- [Guard] Since you guys
were so well behaved,
you get to go outside.
- Now we get some time
outside in the courtyard.
There's an outdoor basketball
court, but it's raining.
Lovely.
All right, who wants to play basketball?
- Guards against inmates?
Three on three.
Oh!
- [Guard] Let's go.
- Okay.
Let's just say the guards
were talking a little smack
while we were playing some basketball.
Turns out they were
better than we thought.
(guards whooping)
- Looks like we gotta
head back to our cells.
I love how our stuff is still
at the front of the cells
from the search.
Our mattresses, what?
I mean,
is it necessary to lead the
mattress flipped on its side?
I feel like the objective of prison
is to make you feel like an animal.
Since Nolan's in solitary confinement,
I could steal his pillow.
I get two pillows.
You hear that?
(cricket chirping)
It's silence.
It's so nice having Nolan gone.
(Nolan screaming)
I'd take it back.
Meanwhile, Weddle and
Zealous were on cooking duty
when they heard this.
(Nolan screaming in the distance)
- Oh, that Nolan?
(Nolan screaming in the distance)
- Hey Nolan, how's it going man?
- Open this door.
- It was time for our next meal
and I guess the guards
are feeling generous
because they let Nolan out of
solitary to come eat with us.
Bund me up.
- Yes, sir.
- All right.
- I'm so excited.
- [Darren] We're hungry scoop faster.
- We've been through a lot in prison.
Wouldn't you guys say?
- Some more the most?
- Yeah.
(inmates chuckling)
Surprisingly, I saw one
of their phone screens
and noticed we're not even 24 hours in.
- [All] Really? Are you serious?
- It just felt like four days, I swear.
- It really does.
- [Jimmy] So Neil, why
you guys are wrestling?
- We're in prison, this
is what prisoners do.
Three, two, go!
(Neil screaming)
- It's so fast. (Neil screaming)
- Let's do Noah versus Weddle and Nolan.
- [Chris] And Nolan, let's go.
- [Jake] Let's go!
- Whichever side wins,
I'll give them five grand.
(inmates sighs)
Five grand on the line.
Three, two.
- Oh God, oh God.
- One, go!
(inmates grunting)
(inmates screaming)
- That was so fast!
- Hey, do you wanna do double or nothing
against the big guy?
- Sure.
- Oh! go get him! Go get him.
He looks bigger than I remember.
Three, two, one, go!
(inmates shouting)
Inmates, inmates!
I'll pay you when I get out of jail.
- [Guard] Back to your cells.
(upbeat techno music)
(bell dings)
Wake up! It's yard time.
Everybody line up outside your cell.
- Every time I finally fall
asleep, I get woken up.
I'm so sick of this place.
We were so bored out of our mind
and even though this is just
a tiny cube of grass outside,
it was a massive blessing.
That's a goal!
Hey, that's a goal, that's a goal.
Header.
(inmates shouting)
- And that's the game.
- For a second out there,
I forgot I was a prisoner.
The outside courtyard with a
grass feels very liberating.
It's my turn to shower and I'm free.
(video game music)
Oh my gosh, I feel so much better now.
I'm literally about to cry.
Here's the problem,
in prison they strip
everything away from you.
So even something as simple as
hot water for a few minutes,
literally changes the
course of your whole day.
(bell dings)
Gentlemen, we have less than
10 hours left in this dump.
(inmates cheering)
In prison the only way you
can see your family or friends
is through visitation.
- Mom, dad?
- Nolan, Nolan, what have you done?
- We raised you better than this.
- I don't need to follow
no rules, I'm in prison.
I run this place.
- You will behave the rest of
the time that you're in here.
- Listen, I might escape.
- No.
- [Guard] Time's up, let's
- Hey, hey, mom!
- [Jimmy] Chris has a visitor.
- Come on, come on, come on.
Just hurry up, hurry up!
I wanna see him.
- Look up, there's daddy.
- Hey little man.
- Look, there's daddy.
- I wish I could hold you buddy.
(baby crying)
- Hey, visitation's over.
- No, I just got to see my son.
He's so cute, look at him.
- Time to go.
- Well, everyone else
was having loved ones
visit them in prison.
I paid a lawyer to come visit me
and told him nothing about why.
How's it going?
- Good Jimmy, what's going on?
- Well, I just wanted to make sure
that they knew I did nothing wrong.
- Okay, but why would they
put you in prison though?
- I'm here for a video I'm
spending 50 hours in prison.
- You can spend 50 hours in prison
but I'm here to help you get out.
- Well, I don't wanna get out.
- Okay, not sure I understand.
Am I still getting paid for this?
- Of course.
- Okay cool, have a good day.
Don't worry, boys, I talked to a lawyer.
Things make much more sense, now.
- He wants to be in there
but I'm an attorney trying to get him out.
It doesn't make any sense.
(clock ticking)
- I'm so tired.
I can't stay in this place
anymore, I might try to escape.
- [Jimmy] I'm gonna be honest guys.
This prison food gets bland really fast.
I'm only in here for two days
and I couldn't imagine
living years in prison.
Gentlemen, do you know
what's in front of you?
- [Inmates] Wieners.
- No, your last meal in prison.
Round of applause.
(inmates applauding)
Also prison might come across
a lot more fun in this video
than it actually is.
Let me assure you it's not fun.
We're just idiots that can
make anything look fun.
Don't go to jail.
(clock ticking)
- [Chris] Last meal was good,
but I'm not gonna miss this place.
(somber music)
- [Nolan] I'm getting out of here.
(intense music)
(guards shouting)
- On the ground! On the ground!
On the ground! On the ground!
(Nolan screaming)
- [Nolan] You can't me!
- Hands on the back.
- There's the exit!
No it's locked! It's
locked! (Nolan screaming)
- On the ground!
Hands on your back.
- I'm glad you found me.
- I was actually lost, I
got lost from the group.
- Nolan booked it.
- There's like three hours left.
What's going on?
- Let's come down boys,
pineapple that's my save word.
Pineapple.
That's tight, that's real tight.
- We're going to your cells,
I'm gonna help you out.
- Okay.
Wait, this is hard.
(inmates laughing)
Oh, that hurt.
- Hey, let's talk about this.
Come on, no!
No, at least take the
handcuffs off at least.
- Like if he ran away
yesterday makes sense,
but we have like three hours left.
What's the point?
Probably the weirdest
thing I've ever done.
Nolan, you caused me to have to do this.
(clock ticking)
It's the home stretch, one
hour and I'm out of here.
(clock ticking)
Inmates!
- [Inmates] Yeah?
- We officially have less
than 30 minutes remaining.
(inmates cheering)
Our friend Nolan is still
in solitary confinement.
Let's salute him.
(trumpets music)
- [Inmates] Five, four, three, two, one.
(inmates cheering)
(Jimmy clapping)
(inmates cheering)
(triumphant music)
(man vocalizing)
- Hello?
Hello?
(bomb exploding)"
NZlClr_ivb4,"- If you make this shot.
- No way.
- You win money.
And every time someone misses a shot,
I add $10,000 to the prize pool.
We are currently on top
of a 250 foot bridge.
Drake, if you can make that basketball
into that hoop down there,
I'll give you $10,000.
- 10 grand?
- All right, bet.
Oh wait, you're not even gonna think.
Okay. He just shot.
- Hold on.
Oh, oh. Oh, dude.
- Oh no.
- It like changed last second.
- That 10 grand. Sorry about it.
Here's a dart, Adam.
- Okay.
- You hit that bullseye,
this 20 grand is yours.
- That's enough to buy the house, dude.
- Adam! Adam! Adam!
- I like that. I like that.
And the lights, too.
Okay. All right.
- The bullseye's here.
The dart's here. Next one.
Chris, this is $30,000 in cash.
And if he hits a half court shot like this
I'll give him 30 grand.
Did it go in?
- Yeah, it did.
- I got this, I got this,
I got this, I got this.
- Let's see it.
- I got this.
- There's no way he's making this.
- Okay. Oh.
- You have three seconds.
What do you have to say?
- Yeah.
- And now we're at a
golf course with $40,000.
And if Dave here can hit
a hole in one like this,
I'll give him $40,000.
I know I missed.
I'm not even gonna try
to make a hole in one.
You might remember Dave from this video
where we gave him a shot
at a million dollars
if he hit a hole in one.
Oh.
- Oh my gosh.
- Oh snap. Oh my gosh.
That is so close.
And you might remember you were
six feet away from a million dollars,
which is why for this shot,
we conveniently move the hole six feet
to exactly where you missed.
Before you swing, I want
you to look at this $40,000.
You put that in the hole.
I put this in your trunk.
Oh, he hit it.
Oh, wait, wait. Let's go look.
Clearly we didn't move the pin far enough.
Carl, I'm gonna let
you deal with this one.
- Maybe Jimmy will give you a third time
trying to get a hole in one.
- I like a third time.
- But not now.
- Not now. Next time.
- We did 10,000, 20,000, 30,000, 40,000.
And now $50,000 is on the line.
And for this trick shot, I'm
gonna let Carl demonstrate it.
Oh my gosh. I can't believe
you did that first try.
That's basically the trick shot.
And Tariq, let me hold this camera.
You saw what Carl just did, Tariq.
If you could put this soccer
ball in that trash can,
I will give you $50,000 in cash.
And here's the thing, Tariq.
Carl literally did it first try, watch.
- Not that one. Not that one.
- If Carl can do it first try, so can you.
Tariq! Tariq!
He missed it. Lost 10 grand.
Now you lost 50 grand. What is that, 60?
60 is what we're about
to offer the next person.
- Oh, okay.
- If you can hit a home run,
I'll give you this $60,000 in cash.
- Are you serious?
- And just to show it's possible,
I'm gonna demonstrate before he tries.
Literally all he has to do is
hit a home run like that right there,
and he'll get 60 grand.
Noah, here is the baseball bat.
Your arms are ginormous.
I don't see how you
don't hit this to Mars.
The next person competes for 70 grand.
This view's getting crazy.
Who's gonna get? Boom!
Whoa. Oh.
Just where you gotta,
we gotta take the money.
- Wait, I get to keep the
ones that fell out, right?
- And now we're on a
football field with 10,000,
20,000 30, 40, 50, 60, $70,000.
And if our contestants launch a baby doll
from this cannon and to that crib.
- It's a crib.
- They get this $70,000 in cash.
Chris, can you demonstrate
how the baby cannon works?
- Can you call me Elon Musk,
'cause I'm about to
send this baby to space.
- Okay, Elon Musk.
Oh, it's still flying.
It's still flying.
- Yay.
- All you gotta do is take this baby,
cram the baby in there.
All right, there we go. Let me see that.
Launch the baby when you're ready.
- All right. Three, two, one.
- Oh, oh, oh. No.
- Do you not practice shooting
babies out of a cannon?
- You're not very good
at launching babies.
To be honest, I'd be
surprised if you were.
Chris is sitting over top of a dunk tank
and I got $75,000 here.
I think you know where
I'm going with this, Sam.
- I'm pretty excited.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
- Sam, if you can hit that red button
from behind this line, you win $75,000.
- No way.
- Woo. Let's get it.
- One baby, one red
button. Does he hit it?
Oh.
- Oh.
- Thank goodness I don't get wet.
- I know you're sad,
but we're gonna move on.
Now we're back in the gym
with $80,000 on the line.
- But you're Jim.
- I hate him.
Would you like a shot at
winning this 80 grand?
- Yeah.
- Put this blindfold on.
Now put this blindfold on.
- Seems a little excessive, Jimmy.
Now three blindfolds?
- I need more blindfolds.
Carl, you lure him around.
- Why did you give Carl control?
I trust you, not Carl.
- In total, there are
eight basketball goals.
You get one shot and if you score
on any of these goals, you get $80,000.
- I'm gonna take a page
out of the bat's book
and I'm gonna use
echolocation to find the goal.
- I feel like I'm kinda middle.
- I can't believe this
dude just used echolocation
to realize he's in the
middle of the court.
How is he so smart?
- Did I make it?
- Take them off.
You're directly under the hoop.
Okay, help me package up
the 80 grand you didn't win.
- That's just insulting to injury.
- This next shot was
supposed to be for $90,000
but I'm making it a
hundred because why not?
And I'm surrounded by 10 basketball goals.
Carl's gonna go up in the
air in this helicopter
and demonstrate the shot.
Drop the basketball.
Oh, oh!
- Was that in? Yes. That
was in. That was in.
- That was the hundred
thousand dollar shot.
If you can get in that
helicopter, make a shot,
I'll give you a hundred thousand dollar.
- Deal. Let's do this thing.
- While we're waiting on the helicopter,
How'd that last a hundred grand treat you?
- Amazing. Changed my life forever.
- I mean, what'd you spend it on?
- Paid off the cars.
Put some money away for
my kids' college funds.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- You know when he is not chasing me
and trying to tackle me,
he's a pretty nice guy.
- This ball right here, it's crazy.
It's not a regular ball anymore.
It's got the chance to
change my life forever.
- And before he shoots the $100,000 shot,
I'm gonna tell the pilot
to raise the helicopter.
Raise it up.
- Oh, why are we going up?
- If you could see the look
on the bounty hunter's
face, he looks so confused.
- No, wait. Is it fair?
- That looks good. Let it rain.
Oh. Oh. Oh, wait.
Oh no.
If we leave before the helicopter lands,
we don't have to see him when he's sad.
- It won't be awkward.
- Yeah, right. Next bit.
This is 100 bowling pins.
and if Nolan bowls a
strike, he gets 110 grand.
The reason why he's doing it
is because in the island video,
he lost $800,000 because
he sucks at bowling.
- I can hear you.
- And before I have Nolan
attempt to knock down the 100 pins,
I'm gonna give it a try
because it looks fun.
This is my first try.
I missed. I missed.
I'm gonna show you guys a trick.
Editing, it's cool.
Nolan, here is your bowling bowl.
Nolan's bowling! Nolan's bowling!
All right. He did it. It left his hand.
- Oh! Oh! Go down.
Oh, go down. Oh, oh.
I hate bowling!
- Bowling also hates you.
He lost an $880,000 island
to bowling in this video.
He lost $110,000 to bowling in this video.
So if you lose another
10 grand to bowling,
you have lost a million dollars to it.
If you knock this pin over with that pin,
I'll give you 10 grand.
- I literally couldn't mess this up.
- Just throw it.
- No!
- All right.
He's now lost a million
dollars to bowling.
All right, I'm satisfied. Next bit.
Every single challenge we've
added a $10,000 briefcase.
And look at how many we have.
And you might be wondering,
why do we have a bathroom
and $120,000 in the middle of the woods?
Well, that's because we're gonna lift
this contestant right
here 100 feet in the air
for this toilet paper trick shot.
Don't ask questions.
The boom lift's starting
to get a little shaky.
- Can I shoot it now?
- Hey, a little bit more.
- My hands, my palms are sweaty.
- My knees are weak.
- I don't see no spaghetti.
- Oh crap. He's right.
- 120 grand on the line. Have at it.
Oh, she threw it. She threw it.
Oh, I felt kind of bad that
her toilet paper missed the toilet.
I can't say that with a straight face.
So I gave her one more try for $10,000
and she still missed.
Jerry, can you confirm 10
grand is in this briefcase?
- Yes, it is 10 grand.
- Okay. $10,000.
130,000. Close the trunk.
And this is a hammer.
Smash that window, Chris.
And Chris, if you wouldn't mind,
could you also smash this one,
which leaves this tiny
window here remaining.
If you can smash that tiny window.
- Okay.
- With that hammer,
I'll let you keep the car and
the 130 grand in the trunk.
You look a little nervous, pal.
- It's not that I'm nervous.
It's that my arms are little boy arms.
- I feel like I should back up.
Throw it as hard as you can.
Oh, oh.
- I broke some window though.
I felt really bad for Wendle,
so I decided to give Nolan
a chance to redeem him.
That's wasn't even close.
That wasn't even close, but I feel bad.
Just take the car with
the shattered windows.
I'm gonna take the money
and we're gonna just
head to the next place.
We are now adding another $10,000,
bringing the total to 140 grand.
This is our contestant, Neal.
And this is my bodyguard
Shaun, who happens to be
ridiculously good at basketball.
If you can score on Shaun,
I'll give you $140,000.
You get one shot.
- He's standing at the free throw line
and his his checkup hand
is right in front of me.
He's a giant.
- No one said winning 140
grand was supposed to be easy.
This is it.
- You ready, Neal?
- Let's go.
- 140 grand on the line.
Let's go, man.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Oh my goodness.
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Since Shaun literally ripped
that money outta Neal's hands,
I wanted to give him a chance for a bit.
If Shaun can score on
him, he'll get $10,000.
- I'll take that. I'll take that.
- All right!
- 10 grand!
Did you for a second think
he was gonna score on you?
- No.
- I love how confident he is.
Next we put an apple
on a mannequin's head.
And if our contestant
can shoot the apple off,
- There you go.
- Then he gets $150,000.
You can literally win more
money than you are tall.
Quote that. On a scale one to 10,
how badly do you want 150 grand?
- I'd say about a 12.
- 12. Okay.
- 12 or 13.
- So you really want it.
Like, it would probably
change your entire life.
- Yeah. I could maybe even get taller.
150 grand. Oh my gosh.
- 150 grand on the line.
Buy a lot of chicken nuggets
and a lot of Beast burgers.
You should order Beast.
What did, you were about shoulder.
- It was left. It was left shoulder.
- He was about shoulder.
- Left shoulder.
- Yeah. Have a good night.
- Thanks, guys.
- Since he missed, we're gonna throw
another 10 grand up here.
It's now officially taller than me.
See that mannequin?
Go stand where it is and get rid of it.
- Roger.
- Next contestant.
We're back in a gym for the
5000000th time this video.
Instead of one contestant,
we're gonna have five.
Here is $40,000.
The next number was 200 grand
and since there's five of them,
they're just gonna split it.
Basically, if one of you
can hit a half court shot,
you all get 40 grand.
- Wait, how many chances do we get?
- You each get to shoot one shot.
If all five of you miss,
I take the briefcases back
and you go home with nothing.
- Oh all right. Let's get it.
- We got it. 200 K! 200 K!
- Who's shooting first?
- I'm taking it first.
- Let's see it. Is he
clutch? Let's find out.
Oh. Off the back of the rim.
One down, four to go.
Come on, Tyler.
And it's off. It's, oh, it's looking good.
Oh, oh. O for two.
- Hey, let's go. Clap me up.
Let's go, get high.
Come on, let's shut out.
- Three more remain.
- Off. Oh, whoa.
It was in. It was literally,
it was like in the rim.
$200,000 on the line.
Shoot when you're ready.
- You're gonna make this.
Believe in yourself.
- For the boys. For the boys.
Oh, what?
I do not envy the pressure
you're feeling now.
I'm not even gonna say anything.
Let's let him do his thing.
And it's in the air.
No. Oh. Oh my gosh.
Yes. That's in.
Oh, my gosh.
That was the most hyped
thing I've ever seen.
Oh my gosh. That was clutch.
Like the sign says, it's $200,000.
Each of your grab four briefcases.
Throw it in your cars.
Thank you for watching.
Subscribe."
E6E22XQPhhg,"- Anything you fit in this triangle.
I'll pay for.
- Bet, let's go!
I think I wanna start right here, bro.
- [MrBeast] You're
starting off with the TV.
Where are you gonna put it?
- [Adam] Yeah, we can put
this right on the line.
- [MrBeast] Oh my gosh.
I just realized how big this triangle is.
You want another TV?
- [Adam] I'll take two, bro.
You gotta double up,
(dramatic note)
you gotta-
- [MrBeast] Oh, Tareq, Tareq!
- [Adam] What are you doing?
- [MrBeast] Tareq, you do realize,
if this touches the red line, he loses it?
You almost just made him lose.
- [Adam] Do you hate me, Tareq?
- [Chris] What if we use those big TVs
and then you can put other
things on top of them.
- [MrBeast] Adam, you can walk away
with a million dollars.
Don't let Chris screw you.
(high-pitched alarm)
- [Chandler] I thought
that was the bathroom.
- [Chris] You gotta stand it up.
- [Adam] You gotta stand it up.
One, two, (groans)
- [Karl] Go, go.
- [Chris] TV's in.
- [MrBeast] We need to
start going over with it.
- [Karl] Lift your side up a little bit.
- [Adam] Okay. We're good.
- [Karl] There you go. Slowly.
- Yes.
- [Chris] There we go, there we go.
- [Adam] (screaming) Yes!
- [MrBeast] We have
now created a TV table.
- [Adam] Guys, we can get that 85 inch
on top of this one and
make a double table.
- [MrBeast] So you guys
wanna do another TV table
on this TV?
- [Adam] Absolutely.
- [MrBeast] There is zero chance
this is happening.
(upbeat music)
Oh, oh, oh
(startled sound effect)
You almost touched it.
Watch out, man.
(duck quack)
All right.
- [Adam] One, two, three.
(sounds of effort)
- [Chris] All right, Chandler, hold up.
(varied noises and instruction)
- [Adam] Slowly, guys, slowly.
- No way.
- [MrBeast] There's no
way this just worked.
- [Adam] (screaming) Let's go!
(varied exclamations)
(punching sound effects)
(upbeat music)
- [MrBeast] These boxes
are starting to bow.
Something's bound to go wrong, man.
- [Adam] I think we're good right here.
- [MrBeast] Okay.
Never in a million years
when I laid down this triangle
did I think he fit this much stuff.
Adam managed to fit over
$23,000 worth of stuff
in this triangle,
which is only a fraction
of what other people
later in this video won.
It gets crazy.
This is a parking lot.
Just kidding.
It's a giant red triangle
and anything you fit in this triangle,
I'll pay for.
Follow me.
I'm pretty sure you could fit
this entire Sam's Club in that triangle
if you wanted.
- [Darren] I'm gonna try.
- [MrBeast] The reason why Darren has
such a big triangle outside
is he actually runs my food pantry.
Boom.
Cart number one.
Cart number two.
(explosion)
Oh, dropped your pistachios.
Cart number three.
We maybe filled up
half a percent of the triangle.
Darren, grab as much as you want.
We're gonna head out.
Now we're inside a GameStop
and if you can fit the entire store
in this triangle,
I'll pay for it.
- What the heck?
- [Guest's Friend] I think
it'd be pretty easy, actually.
- If you're with me,
- Uh-huh.
- we can do anything.
- [Guest's Friend] We're
gonna move it all over there
and then we're gonna plan it.
- [Zealous] Wait, wait, wait.
We can't put it in the circle yet.
- [Both] It's a triangle.
- [Zealous] I never passed geometry.
(dramatic music)
- [MrBeast] Chandler wants to-
- [Karl] (screaming) No!
(slower and deeper) No!
(slowed clattering)
No!
- [MrBeast] If anything
hits the edge, they lose.
- [Chandler] How did you do that?
- [Zealous] Karl, it's okay, bro.
- [MrBeast] Zealous, come here, buddy.
- Wait, actually?
- I'm gonna need you to leave.
- All right, see you guys.
Bye.
I love you guys.
- [Karl] I'm so sorry.
- It's okay!
- This time we brought two people.
Have at it, boys.
- [Patrick] Is the shelf for sale?
The shelf could hold all
of the small, loose items.
- [Dave] Oh.
- [MrBeast] These guys were so serious
about winning that they
used a tape measure
to measure the dimensions of the triangle
and then measure the
dimensions of the boxes
so they could perfectly fit them in.
- [Patrick] We are
almost outta space here.
Bring me three more games.
- [Dave] We need to move
some of these things
over to this side.
- What do you think the
configuration should be?
(cheerful music)
- We build a perimeter.
- Side by side vertically
- and then set one on top.
(dramatic music)
- [Patrick We have crossed the line.
I'm gonna put it down.
(dramatic music)
- You put these large boxes,
you filled it to the brim in the middle,
and you still have over
half the store left.
Where do you go from here?
- Up.
(dramatic music)
- This is possibly the craziest thing
I've ever seen in my life.
And the funny part is they still have
a lot of stuff left.
- [Patrick] Do we just
keep going up from here?
- [Dave] There's nowhere else to go, sir.
We can't build down.
- I've never liked Funko Pops
but now I hate them more than ever.
- [Karl] Hey, let me tell you right now,
when you were coming up
these Funkos right here started shaking.
It did that.
That's exactly what they did.
- There's a lot of opportunity
for everything to go wrong
and I will cry.
(worried exclamations)
- [Dave] Oh my God.
- [MrBeast] He is less than one pinky
away from the triangle.
- What else is there to do?
(dramatic music)
- This will fit,
but to fit, it has to
go down on the ground
and slide in and it'll touch the triangle.
- So we don't put that there.
- Yep.
- This has gone too far.
The dude's shoveling stuff in a crack
in between two boxes.
Guys, you got about 10 items left.
- I am so stressed out right now.
- I'm stressed out for them.
Come on, let's just do it.
- [Patrick] Ah.
Okay, okay.
- No, it's...
that is not straight.
That is not straight at all.
- [Patrick] I see what you're doing
and I love it.
- Could you not have made the triangle
just like, a little bit bigger?
- Why? We're having so much fun.
(grunting)
All right.
This is what we've all been waiting for.
Okay.
- This is all the marbles.
- Everyone's gotta let
go at the same time.
Three, two, one.
Everyone let go,
everyone let go.
No one touching it?
- No way.
- Oh! Congratulations.
- We did it!
- [Dave] Oh my God,
Oh my God!
- [Tareq] Nothing is touchin' it.
- We did it!
- I don't know how you did it.
- What did you do today?
Oh, I went to work,
I had some dinner.
What did you do?
I won a GameStop.
- [MrBeast] How is this still up here?
Ironically, this is my third time
buying a GameStop.
Triple fist bump.
(explosion)
You might be wondering,
why is there a giant triangle
in front of a car dealership?
Well, as many cars as she can fit
in that triangle, I'll pay for.
Here's the thing,
if any of these cars touch the red lines,
you lose.
Which is why we brought these boards
to get the cars over the line.
All right, you two are the board guides.
- [Karl] Look good to you?
- I think so.
- Karl, this is slanted.
- [Nolan] What, you don't want her to win
a bunch of cars?
- [MrBeast] All right.
As straight as you can.
Okay.
Oh, all right.
Boom!
- [Karl] Woo!
- The first car is in the triangle
and it did not touch it.
Shirley seemed like a really sweet lady.
So me and the boys
definitely did everything
we could to make sure she won.
(all exclaiming)
- [MrBeast] All right, keep going.
- [Nolan] You can come forward.
Yep.
All right.
(excited exclamations)
- [Shirley] More cars, honey,
more cars.
- [Karl] Woo.
- Okay.
- [Shirley] He better move.
- [Karl] You're good.
- Oh.
- Oh, oh, that one was close.
- Oh, clean.
- Ooh,
that was perfect.
- Oh, it's clean.
- Right there.
- And...
Yeah, okay.
- Right there?
- [MrBeast] Keep comin'.
- [Karl] It looks good to me.
- [MrBeast] All right.
- [Karl] Yeah, it does look good.
- [MrBeast] All right, back wheels.
Bada-boom!
- [Karl] You're good. You're good.
- [Nolan] You good?
- [Karl] You're good.
No, you're good. You're good.
- This is terrifying.
- Now you're good.
You're good, you're good.
You're good.
- [Shirley] One more time.
- [Karl] No, you're good.
- She's got close to
$100,000 in this triangle.
- Woo.
- This is serious.
- Yeah.
- Okay?
If you make her lose,
you're gonna see a grown woman cry.
- And it's gonna be completely on Nolan.
- Why me?
- She just picked her next car
and it's one of the
biggest ones on the lot.
- [Karl] We gotta be careful.
This one looks easy, but if we mess up,
- Okay.
- It's all gone.
- [Shirley] Okay, let's do this.
- [Karl] Hey, don't
worry, you got this, okay?
(laughter)
- [Karl and Nolan] Onward!
- You're good,
- Holy cow.
- you're good.
- Holy cow.
- [Nolan] You're good.
- [Karl] Woo.
- [MrBeast] Now it's just the back wheels.
- [Nolan] Just the back wheels.
- [Shirley] Don't scare me no more.
- [Karl] Keep it comin'.
Let's go.
- [Shirley] Oh God.
(excited exclamations)
- [MrBeast] Just don't even move.
You now have five cars in the triangle.
Over a $100,000.
- [Shirley] Okay.
Are you going for another,
or are you calling it here?
- No, no.
I'm calling it.
- Congratulations!
- [Shirley] Thank you.
- What are you even gonna do
with five cars?
- I get any car I want?
- Every single one.
- All five of these cars
are yours.
- [Shirley] Wait a minute.
(record scratch)
- [MrBeast] I don't understand how,
but she didn't realize she was getting
all five cars.
For whatever reason,
she thought she was only getting one,
even though she put five in the triangle.
- Wait a minute.
You said all five cars, I won?
- [MrBeast] Yeah.
- Oh my God.
(sobbing)
- [MrBeast] Oh gosh.
- Oh my God.
- Okay, we're just crying now.
- Okay, calm down, Shirley.
- [MrBeast] Moments like this
are exactly why I love giving away stuff.
Just watching this footage back
warms my heart.
- Ooh. What do I do with five cars?
(laughter)
I'm just (indistinct) with one.
- [MrBeast] This is Dino.
And if he can successfully jump
out of a plane from thousands of feet
in the air and land in this red triangle,
I'll give him $20,000.
And because I know Tareq
is afraid of heights,
I offered him $20,000 to go up there
and skydive as well.
- Face those fears, Tareq.
- Unless you hate him.
(laughing)
- Okay.
- Let's do it.
Let's go.
- [Chris] Don't worry, Tareq,
I'll always remember you by this.
- [MrBeast] Don't forget, Tareq jumps,
you get another $20,000.
Godspeed.
- Whether you go with him
or whether you go by yourself,
you're getting out this plane.
(laughing)
- Oh my God.
(dramatic music)
- How high are we?
10,000 feet?
Oh my God.
- [Dino] I'm gonna see
you on the ground, baby!
(music ramps up)
Here we go.
(beat drops)
(thrilling music)
There's that triangle.
I'm gonna hit it, man.
We're gonna get that money.
(thrilling music)
- Apparently they just
jumped out of the plane.
So we should probably-
- Yeah, we should move.
- We should get outta the way.
- Yeah,
we should get outta the way.
(thrilling music)
- All right, he's coming in.
He's comin' in.
Oh, oh,
oh!
(loud bang)
(various exclamations)
- [Dino] We just didn't put the brakes
on enough, man.
- Wait, play the footage back.
(slowed exclamations)
You landed in the triangle.
Here, go back over there.
And as far as I can tell, he never left.
(cheering)
- Thank you, bro!
- Hey, wait, where's Tareq?
- [Tareq] Oh, this is crazy.
(excited exclamations)
(cheering)
- [Dino] How you feel, baby?
You made me feel great.
- He landed in the
triangle and won $20,000.
And because you jumped,
he just won $40,000.
(cheering)
- Have you ever had $40,000 in cash?
- No.
- What are you gonna spend it on?
- I don't even know. (laughs)
- All right.
Well, while he figures that out,
let's go check on Darren.
According to the cash here,
so far you've spent $25,000.
I gave you this giant triangle.
- I know, I know, I know.
- And all you spend is $25,000?
- Can I use pallets?
- Yes.
Get some pallets.
Put 'em in this triangle.
I'm gonna go give away more money.
We need food to feed people.
Neil. Under this black blanket
is a triangle and whatever you can fit
in that triangle, I'll pay for.
- It's a big black tarp though.
- It is a big black tarp.
There's no key indicators here.
Anyways, grab whatever you can.
- Those are like $2,000.
- These are $400
- That's what I'm gonna get.
- Supreme clippers.
- That's what I saw.
- I almost have $5,000
in my hands right now.
- Let's put it on the table.
- You're confident
whatever triangle is over here,
these are fitting in it?
- [Neil] No, I'm not.
- Baseball bat.
- We could probably stack
it on the side, right?
If I think it's not gonna fit,
I could put it aside.
- No.
Whatever you put here,
you have to put in the triangle.
If it doesn't fit, you
have to put it back.
- We might have to put some stuff back.
- Put back the baseball bat.
Do I have to say it?
- Wait, so you're
putting these shoes back?
If you're sure.
Here you go.
- I'm not sure.
- Then I think it's time
we show 'em the triangle.
- [Chris] The moment
you've been waiting for.
- [MrBeast] Wait.
This is really cool.
- [Neil] We're supposed
to look at my triangle.
- [MrBeast] Oh yeah, we were supposed
to reveal this.
(various exclamations)
- [Neil] Oh man, that's easy.
- Oh!
- I can stack in there, easy.
- [MrBeast] Sorry, this was my pizza box.
I accidentally left it there.
Did you think this was the triangle?
I totally didn't put it
there to throw him off
so he wouldn't spend as much money
'cause there's like a
$1,000,000 in this store.
(slowed effect) There's
no key indicators here.
- [Neil] I'm still gonna
go with the game plan
even though it's
unnecessary at this point.
(dramatic music)
- [Chris] Oh.
- [Karl] You're not using much...
(alarmed exclamations)
- [Chris] What're you doing?
- [MrBeast] What're you doin'?
- That legit scared me. (laughs)
- [Chris] Come on.
- All right, you're good.
- Stop. Stop!
(all exclaiming)
Oh my gosh.
- [Karl] It can't touch this.
- [Chandler] You can't touch the tape.
- [Neil] Your finger was blocking it.
- You're welcome.
- I coulda kept my bat.
That was the one thing
that I really felt bad about.
- Your bat?
(explosion)
- Okay.
Congratulations. You made it all fit.
What do you have to say before we go?
- Man, thank you guys for everything.
This is awesome.
Thank you for the tips put in the bag.
It was definitely needed
to fit in the triangle.
- [Chandler] Yeah.
- Appreciate everything.
- And now it's your guys' turn.
Chris, I need you to go hide.
Far away.
Anything you fit in this triangle,
Chris will pay for.
But when you finish,
we're gonna remove it all.
And anything Chris fits in this triangle,
you'll have to pay for.
Do you think Chris is
gonna go easy on you?
- He'll go easy.
I'm running up though.
- Yes!
(clapping)
- While you're doing this, just remember
he has a kid and a wife.
- Oh well.
(laughing)
- Alexander McQueens.
Yeah, we'll take some of those.
- Why is this a thing?
This is Supreme Wheaties.
You're gonna make Chris pay for this?
- Yeah, we gotta get that.
- Why are making him pay for this?
- I'm thinking of the children.
- It's for you though.
- Oh, I get to keep this?
- Yeah.
- Yes.
- Oh.
- But Chris gets to do the same thing.
- Oh.
(giggling)
- He didn't even get it.
(grunting)
What did Chris do to you?
That's so much money.
- I know.
He's gonna hate me.
- [MrBeast] Wow, you went easy on Chris.
I was joking.
Chris is literally gonna hate you.
Chris is gonna be mad.
- Big mad.
- What's the total?
- $6,574.45
- Chris is gonna screw you over.
Get outta here.
Chris!
Chandler filled this triangle with stuff
that you have to pay for,
which we hid.
And now we're gonna have you
do the same thing for Chandler.
- How much did he spend?
- How much do you think he spent?
- Like, $4,000.
- $4,000 is the friendship barrier?
- Uh-huh.
And is that okay?
- You're not gonna get anything outta me.
- Is that a big or a small number?
- We're not giving you hints.
- Is that a big one?
- We're saying go grab stuff
and put in that triangle.
- Grab whatever you want.
- I literally set this aside
before the video started
and I was like, ""I'm gonna buy this""
but now Chandler's gonna buy it.
- Just for fun,
you should get this brick
that caused Chandler to lose here.
- Not only did it cause him to lose,
it also just cost him $100.
- Hey.
(explosion)
- Let's go!
- What if Chandler didn't put anything
in the triangle?
Or what if he only put one pair of shoes?
- L!
(laughing)
Maybe I should have got a bigger book bag.
- [Karl] Why are you doing it like that?
- [Chandler] You guys ready?
- [Karl] Okay.
(ding)
- All right.
And what is the total of
everything he grabbed?
- $4,558.18
- Whoops, I broke the
$4,000 friendship limit.
Sorry, Chandler.
- Chandler is standing
in front of what he got.
And Chris is standing
in front of what he got.
Gentlemen, take off the blindfolds.
(dramatic boom)
- Ey, it's pretty even!
Did you try to stay under $4,000?
(laughter)
- Oh my God,
no!
I didn't see the other side.
- Chris, you have to pay
off $6,500 worth of stuff.
(laughing)
And Chandler, you have to pay
$4,500 worth of stuff off.
- The friendship limit's $4,000.
- You owe $6,500.
You owe 4,500,
hug it out.
And while you guys are paying for stuff,
we're going to the next place.
This is Heather and she works
at a children's hospital.
Whatever you can fit in here,
I'll pay for so we can donate.
- [All] Toys, toys, toys,
- I don't know why we're chanting.
Toys.
Assembly line.
- [Chris] Whoa. Salmon.
- I can just like, see the kids light up
when they see this stuff.
It's gonna be so cool.
Dinosaurs.
(explosion)
- [MrBeast] We also brought
some PlayStation 5s for the children.
I think we call it here?
(explosion)
We're gonna check out
and then go take it to the hospital.
We checked out, loaded up the U-Haul,
and drove everything
to a local children's hospital.
The children and staff there
were so excited to receive everything
and I'm just beyond
grateful we could help them.
- [All] Thank you, MrBeast!
- Karl, do you remember in GameStop
where you did this?
- (slowed down) No!
- That was literally yesterday.
- Because of that,
he lost the GameStop.
I think you know where
we're going with this.
I put a whiteboard on Karl's floor.
- [Karl] That's not an Expo marker.
- Is that a peanut?
- Is that a triangle?
- Zealous, anything you put in this oval,
I'll pay for.
Let's go steal stuff from Karl.
Ay, yo, bro, bro, bro.
- What?
- If you're gonna take the PlayStation,
take the controller.
- [Nolan] This guy has another PS5.
- That was my secret one.
- [Zealous] This is
nerve-wracking, actually.
Jimmy, can you catch this Power Glove?
- [MrBeast] Sure.
- [Karl] Not the Power Glove.
- [Nolan] That's a mini fridge.
- [Karl] It's my Monster fridge.
- [Zealous] All right,
hopefully nothing falls.
- Wait, slow and steady.
- Yep, yep, yep.
- I can't believe that worked.
- Is that Totoro?
(laughing)
(squeak)
Oh, he's so cute.
They took gaming consoles
and laid a TV on it.
They're serious.
- [All] Robbing Karl, robbing Karl.
- [MrBeast] All right,
take your hands off.
It's good.
This is all balancing
on two PlayStation 5s.
- Yeah, I think we'll call it here.
- Congratulations on all this stuff
and Karl,
everything he took,
I'm gonna buy you a replica of.
- [Zealous] Oh!
- All right!
- Let's go!
So, he didn't actually take anything,
I'm gonna buy replicas for Karl,
next bit.
All right, Darren (indistinct)
- [Chris] What the heck?
There's so much food here.
- I think it's been 12 hours.
I don't even know anymore,
but I have given this everything I got
and I couldn't even come close
to matching your generosity.
- [Chris] Yeah.
- You know what you coulda done?
You coulda just taken apart the triangle
and put it around Sam's Club.
- That woulda been easier.
- You managed to put a lot
of food in this triangle,
cut the drone shot.
Let's go see the total.
And now the moment of truth.
Buffy, tell me the damage.
How much did Darren spend?
- $82,058.
- You couldn't even get over $100,000?
- I did my best, man.
- Genuinely thank you so much
for staying open late.
Can I shake your hand?
- [Buffy] Yes.
- [MrBeast] I appreciate you.
- We were happy to help you guys.
- Because of the food
we bought in this video,
we're literally gonna start servicing
another community every two weeks.
Go check out the Beast
Philanthropy channel.
We'll show you there.
Goodbye.
(explosion)
(cheerful music)
(explosion)"
TQHEJj68Jew,"- This is a professional bounty hunter,
and if he successfully hunts me down,
he gets $100,000.
He has until midnight to
steal this backpack from me,
and all I gave them was a knife.
See ya!
- [Chris] Oh, what do you mean?
- [Karl] Oh, we're going this way here
- Where'd he go?
- Later, Nerds!
- There we go. All right.
- We're out, we're out, let's go!
- And now we have a knife.
- This is going to be
the craziest chase ever.
I have a helicopter
lined up, a dozen cars,
I have everything.
He is not hunting me down.
- You in?
- We're in.
- All right, here we go.
- [Chris] Yeah!
- Honestly, guys, we got this in the bag.
I've caught way scarier people.
- Wait, is that them?
- [Bounty Hunter] Yeah.
- [Speaker] We're also on the way.
- Way we gotta go faster, they're
literally right behind us.
- Go, go, go.
There he is, there he is!
Go, go, go, go!
- Go, go, go.
- The boys know I'm driving this car,
so the first thing we're do is go
to the closest dealership
and buy a new car.
- All right guys, good news.
I put a tracker on his phone.
We know exactly where he is
and we can follow him now.
- Let's go, let's go.
(group excitedly cheers)
- Let's get this a hundred grand!
- [Tariq] I can't believe
we're about to buy a new car.
- I called them ahead of time.
Um, you have the car ready?
- I do.
- How much was it?
- I think it was like 25.
- $10,000, $10,000.
Just keep the change on that.
All right, do you have the key?
- Yeah, absolutely.
- All right.
- Thanks for shopping at Coastal Kia.
- [Bounty Hunter] We're
getting right on em.
It shows that they stopped
at a car dealership.
- Oh he's switching cars.
- [Jimmy] The boys got to the dealership
and when they checked their GPS
they realized I already left.
And the guy that sold me
the car started to talk.
- Now, what car is he driving?
- It's a Kia Soul.
- No one buys Kia Souls. Don't even.
- All right. I'm calling Jimmy.
- What up guys?
- Did you buy a new car?
- Well, I mean, yeah, of course I did.
- I'm ashamed of you, if you
actually bought a Kia Soul
- Ugh, looks like we gotta
ditch this car as well.
- [Karl] What are you
doing in the slow lane?
It's a hundred thousand dollars.
- It's unbelievable seeing that amount
of money in the backpack.
I gotta go get it.
- This is probably one
of the weirdest things
I've ever done.
This warehouse is in the middle of nowhere
and I had a vault installed in it.
This is made of the same
stuff they use in banks.
And now we seal ourself in.
Don't worry, just trust me.
- [Tariq] Okay.
- My plan is to stay in
this vault until midnight
and save a hundred grand.
- [Tariq] Wait really?
- Maybe.
(laughing)
- [Bounty Hunter] It says
that he is right here.
There's the Kia Soul!
- [Karl] Wait where?
- [Chris] Wait there he is!
- [Karl] He's hiding in the warehouse!
- I'll watch!
- [Chris] Should we ask
people like in here?
- Why is there a safe here?
- [Chris] Is he in the safe?
- Hey, bounty hunter!
Can you hear me?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Welcome to my safe.
This is one of the most secure
vaults in the entire world.
- What the heck?
- Where did you get this?
- I bought it from a bank.
(laughing)
You're probably wondering,
'How are you gonna get in so
you can win a hundred grand.
I don't know, figure it out.
- All right, if I know Jimmy.
(metal music starts)
- Nice!
- I'm scared.
- [Jimmy] What the boys
didn't know was that
there was a secret tunnel under the safe,
and Tariq and I escaped out
the back of the warehouse
and ran for the U-Haul truck
I planted earlier that day.
And just when we thought we were home free
- Did we leave the 100k in the safe?
- [Jimmy] Oh God! Can you go back?
- Yeah, I can go back.
- [Jimmy] Yeah, go get
it! God speed, Tariq!
God speed!
- Is he still in there?
- I don't know.
He hasn't said anything.
- Check the back.
- Oh, there's a way out.
- We gotta get around the back. Come on!
- Jimmy, promise me to
never lose 100k ever again.
That was so scary.
- [Jimmy] And now we're off
to the local movie theater,
I wonder if they've caught on yet.
- Wait, did he get out
through here, at the bottom?
- That's how he got out.
- Where'd he go?
- He went out through that gate.
- If we go through this way,
we can open up the safe.
- Guys, get in here!
- He left the computer.
Let's see what it played.
(computer audio starts)
- [Jimmy] Cause, um,
you're a bunch of nerds,
and nerds aren't gonna catch me.
- Was he ever here?!
(X-Files intro music plays)
- By now they had to have caught on
that we're no longer in the vault.
Honestly, they have to be pretty close.
So, Tariq hurry up!
- [Bounty Hunter] Guys,
we're wasting time.
That tracker says that he's left.
- Hey, Jimmy!
- That seemed like a nice
speaker, but let's go!
- Wait, he used a different car?
- Go, go, go, go.
(tire squealing)
- [Tariq] That's the
movie theater right there.
- [Jimmy] Get out the way grandma,
I got a bounty hunter on me!
- [Tariq] All right, park
right here, park right here.
- We're now at the movie theater, come on!
And we don't need masks
because we've rented the entire place.
Read the name of that, what does that say?
Here, zoom in on that.
- [Tariq] Observation, oh!
- [Jimmy] Go, go, go, go, go!
- [Tariq] Was that them?
(bell dings)
- Tariq, look back here.
There's a secret door!
All right, and now we are sealed off.
- This is ridiculous.
Have you ever had to chase
after somebody this much?
- Just the other day, man,
we were running, jumping
over fences, chasing a guy, but we got him
just like we're gonna get Jimmy.
It looks like he might be
right where the U-Haul is.
It says that he's in the U-Haul.
- [Karl] Is he in the U-Haul?
- Any luck in the back?
- I'm gonna try to break the locks open.
This is awkward,
If it's not our truck.
- Yeah, there's just a lot of chicken.
It's so hot in here.
- All right guys, the U-Haul's and no-go.
Real quick, before we go in there,
let's check the tracker and
just see where he is at.
- It still says we're right on top of him.
- Come on.
- Nothing! Where did he go?
- Did you hear that?
- Oh, God.
- Dude, how does he keep disappearing
right from underneath us?
- Carl smells.
- Wait, what?
- This one's like lighting up!
- Wait, something's playing.
- Wait, this looks like
Buried Alive, right?
Oh no, this is,
- This is the Island Video!
- This is him leaving the island!
- Oh yeah, I'm on this video.
- No, no!
- That's so embarrassing!
- This is stupid!
- Check roof? Guys, come here.
- [Bounty Hunter] The
tracker still says he's here.
- They just checked this room,
and since I wasn't in this room,
they now think I'm on the roof.
But what they didn't think of
is instead of being above it,
I'm below it.
- He rented out a whole movie theater
just to hide on the roof?
- This man's insane.
- I need this money, let's go, hurry up!
- I'm coming!
- JIMMY!
- I have access to the security cameras
of the movie theater on my phone.
I can see that
they're currently upstairs.
So now's our time to go.
- All right, I gotcha.
- I think he got us again.
- Hey look, we got a
great bird's eye view.
Let's see what we can see.
- That camera looks suspicious.
- Let's go take a look at it.
But then I think we
should get back inside.
He's definitely watching us.
That cord leads us back down.
Guys we gotta focus,
the tracker is moving.
- Right over here's an exit door.
And according to the
cameras they're on the roof.
Earlier today, I called
the fire department
and they disconnected this fire alarm.
So you know what that means.
(clicks)
Let's go!
(fire alarm sounds)
- Shoot, we gotta go.
- We gotta get back to the car.
- Where the fire alarm's coming from?
- The fire's coming!
- Yo, that was perfect timing!
That wasn't insane.
I bet they're freaking out right now.
According to the security
cams currently running
down the stairs. So we do have
a decent head start on them.
But no matter what we need to be fast
'cause all it takes is one slip up
and I lose a hundred thousand dollars.
And if you thought what we just did
in the movie theater was cool,
let's just say that
was only the beginning.
- Go, go, go, go!
- Dude. It's personal for me now.
I want you to win.
He did that island stunt, come on.
- Turn the AC on! It's hot!
- I don't think he knows
how the earth works.
- We decided to get in
the truck, it's hot.
- [Bounty Hunter] Welcome
back, we got the AC pumping.
We're right on him, we're within a mile.
- It's personal.
- We are now going into a
ginormous field and as you can see
I have a ride waiting;
our getaway vehicle.
I missed.
So that bar is stopping them
from driving their car back here.
And they're not gonna be
able to keep up with me.
- [Bounty Hunter] Looks
like there's a car out there
that got ditched.
The doors are open and everything.
- I'm calling Chris.
Are you here?
- We're pulling up right now.
There's like a car with the doors open,
I, of course you left the doors open.
- So you see the car with the doors open.
That was my car, correct?
- How many Kias did you buy?
- Go, go, go, go, go, go!
- Your ATV's over there!
That was a lie, they don't have one!
- [Bounty Hunter] Ah, he was right there!
- [Jimmy] And now we book it!
(fast paced music plays)
- My legs, sir.
- We're going the right way.
- Do you have the 100k?
(grunts)
- Now we left the car.
This is the key to it.
You see the key to the ATV? Bye!
- [Tariq] Oh, it's gone.
- The reason we had to ditch the ATV
is cause of these train tracks.
Our next trap is over here.
We're out of the woods.
They're right on our tail.
- Yeah, yeah. He definitely
crossed the train tracks.
- [Jimmy] We gotta go
across this big field.
- [Tariq] You're joking.
- [Jimmy] The sun was
beating down on me and Tariq.
It was so hot!
We passed by some people
and I convinced this guy
to sell me his hat for $10,000
so I could cool off.
Pretty good deal if you ask me.
As you guys can see, we
have a helicopter here okay?
We also have a bunch of porta-potties.
And you might be wondering
why do we have a helicopter
and a bunch of porta-potties?
It's a diversion!
They're gonna be expecting me to be
inside one of these porta-potties.
But what they don't know,
behind that Bush is actually another car.
I hid this bad boy last night.
- All right we're right on his tail.
GPS has got him, we're about to catch him.
We just gotta get through this field.
- It's almost like this is your job, dude.
How are you not tired?
- Oh, I'm exhausted, but
that reward is worth it.
Does anyone see him?
- I don't see him.
- I'm gonna give the pilot
the signal to take off.
- Oh my God, there's a helicopter.
(helicopter engine revs)
- He's in the porta-potty! What?
- [Chris] Wait, he's in the porta-potty!
Let's go.
(intense music plays)
- [Jimmy] They're gonna think
I'm in this porta-potty.
Look at that helicopter!
It's lifting up the porta-potty!
- [Bounty Hunter] He's gotta
be in that porta potty.
(phone ringing)
- Karl!
- Hello? Jimmy?
- Oh, whoa, whoa!
Karl I'm in the porta-potty, HELP!
- You're in the freaking
porta-potty in the helicopter?
- Isn't that kind of unsafe?
- I just hung up, so he thinks
something's going wrong.
- He just hung up.
- Oh no!
- Do they actually think
I'm in the porta-potty?
- [Tariq] Probably, honestly.
- They should be able to tell
I'm just chilling in a car
hidden in the woods.
- [Bounty Hunter] The
tracker says he's still here.
Doesn't have him moving.
- It's your call.
- I think he's still
in those porta-potties.
We gotta check all the porta-potties.
What is that?
- That's a Mustang.
Is that Jimmy?
- Ah, later nerds!
- [Bounty Hunter] Oh, that's Jimmy.
- [Karl] What? There he goes.
- Oh my gosh.
Yo, that was so close.
Chris almost had us!
- We've gotta be more stealthy.
We've gotta use the woods.
We've gotta blend in with
what we got around us
or he is gonna get away again.
- [Jimmy] We've been in
a safe, a movie theater,
a random field with a
helicopter and porta-potties;
but this next location isn't as weird.
We're going to a mansion.
Not my mansion.
I rented it. I don't have
a mansion 'cause I spend
tens of millions of dollars
filming these videos.
And here's the mansion we rented.
Follow me, Tariq.
And I know for a fact, the
boys are way behind us.
We left them in the middle
of a cornfield with no car.
Me and Tariq are gonna rest
here real quick, recharge.
We have security cameras
hooked up everywhere
and we can see exactly when they pull in.
- [Bounty Hunter] All right,
as we get closer, guys.
we're not gonna park right
where the last points were.
We're gonna park a little
further away and try to sneak in.
- All right, that sounds stealthy.
- All right guys, take a look.
If we look at this, it's
showing that he went
to one of these three corner houses.
Yeah, I got it.
- You do?
- I can see him, yeah.
Yeah. Do you see the, you
can kind of see the end
of the Mustang right there,
with the boat in the driveway.
- Literally all I'm doing is just staring
at these security cams.
The second I see them
I'm booking it for the boat.
- [Chris] Oh my God.
This is like a palace!
- Oh, they're coming, they're
coming! They're running.
Go, go, go Tariq, go, go,
go, go! Oh God. Oh God.
They're running so fast.
- Is that him?
There he is.
He's on the dock.
- [Karl] Come on!
- Hold up, hold up.
- He's right there!
- They're not holding up.
- [Chris] Oh my God.
- Get us outta here!
- [Tariq] Let's let, let let's go!
- [Karl] What are we gonna do?
- [Chris] They got another boat?
- [Jimmy] You thought you
had us! My hundred grand!
These things just keep
getting closer and closer.
I was like, wait, wait.
And they didn't wait.
- We're gonna take the truck.
We're gonna try and parallel them.
We'll take whatever road
parallels them on the water.
- Okay.
- The plane is we go to the
dock all the way down there.
Then I buy a car off of
someone who's waiting for me.
- [Tariq] Wait, you're
gonna buy another car?
- Yes. And then we go back
to the abandoned hospital
from the tag video where I have
hundreds of mannequins set up
and I'm gonna hide amongst them.
And then after that,
we're gonna go to a hotel
that I rented every room.
- Good news guys.
Even though he left on the boat
the GPS is still tracking him.
So I've got a good point on him still.
We're about to be right on top of him.
He's right under this bridge
that we're about to go over.
- What do we do when
we get over top of him?
- We're gonna jump off
the bridge and go get him.
- We traveled all down
the intercoastal waterway
and we're at another dock.
We gotta be inconspicuous
because the boys could be here waiting.
I don't know where they are.
You're the guy I talked to on the phone?
- Yeah. Hey Jimmy, how you doing?
- We agreed to 20,000 on the phone.
- Uh huh.
- Here you go.
Have a good day man.
- All right, thanks man.
- It's showing that
he's directly under us.
Oh my God.
He is right there.
He's right there.
- [Karl] He's driving the red car!
- Oh they there they,
they are. Do you see them?
They're right behind us.
- [Chris] Chase him!
Holy cow!
- [Chris] Oh my God!
- Make sure the doors are locked.
I bet you at a red light
they're gonna try to hop in.
- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
- [Jimmy] Oh, he's coming.
- [Karl] Come on, come
on, come on, come on.
It was Chris.
He hit our bumper!
- [Bounty Hunter] Come on, come on!
- I thought you were leaving me!
- What's up.
- We're gonna get you.
- I can't hear you.
- I feel like he's reaching
his end point here.
- Tariq, it's time we had a serious talk.
- What's up?
- You know, I consider you a brother
- Of course.
- Which is why I need to sacrifice you.
- Wait what?
- The second we pull in and
I throw the car in park,
- Okay
- I need you to get out
and I need you to go
deck the bounty hunter.
I'm talking college, D1
lineman, just sack him.
- You see how big that guy is?
- [Jimmy] We're pulling into the hospital.
Tariq, this is your time to shine.
All right, get out.
- [Bounty Hunter] Go, go, go, go, go, go.
- [Tariq] Go Jimmy, go!
- That's what I told you.
- Aw, God dang it!
No, no!
- [Bounty Hunter] Oh he's running!
(screaming)
- [Jimmy] I wanna play this
moment in slow-mo for you.
As you can see, Chris hugged me.
What do you do when one
of your best friends
is just hugging you for dear life?
I didn't wanna hurt him.
So I had no choice, but to
just let him bear hug me
and then let the bounty hunter catch up
and steal the money from me!
(kazoo blowing)
(cash register opening)
- Yes, we did it!
- [Bounty Hunter] Yes!
Hey, great tackle!
- Yes!
- I did what you said!
You said we should tackle
him and I tackled him.
- That was perfect.
- Congratulations on the hundred grand.
(cash register opening)
- Thank you
Thank you so much!
- I'm a little salty,
but at the end of the day
you won it fair and square.
I wanted to show you guys
the mannequins in here.
We also rented an entire hotel
but they beat us before we could get to.
- I got a young child at home
and this money sets him up.
This is his college fund
This changes my life.
Thank you so much.

WcwGleN38zE,"- We are currently at
an abandoned hospital
with over 100 different rooms
and six different
buildings surrounding it.
This is $100,000 in cash
and whichever one of you
I touched last, keeps it.
10, nine.
(scream)
Eight, seven.
(screaming)
Six, five, four..
- I'm going this way.
- [Jimmy] Three, two.
- I Gotta hide.
- One.
I wanna get someone quick, let's go.
- I Think we got these boys.
We ain't getting out first,
we ain't getting out first.
- There's so many rooms.
- Going outside.
- They're not gonna get me,
they're not gonna get me.
- I hear them over here.
- Climb up this ladder.
I think this will work, I'm on the roof.
- Oh, wait a minute.
(intensifying music)
- I see Nolan, I see...
- Oh, fudge, there's Jimmy.
- Oh no, he's so far away.
- Oh no, he's booking.
He's booking it.
- Wait, I can cut through here.
- I'm getting out here.
- Where'd he go?
My gut's telling me he
went in this building.
- Jimmy was just back there.
Karl, Jimmy was just over there.
- I saw you run in here.
He was over here somewhere.
- All right, we're rolling, we're rolling.
- [Jimmy] No, I'm so tired.
- Oh no.
- Oh my god.
- [Sam] No.
(buzzer)
I broke the camera and everything.
I ain't running five years, man.
- I gotta escort you to jail.
- But I don't wand to go to jail.
- We all do things we don't wanna do.
I don't wanna run.
There.
One down nine more to go.
- Tried my best.
He just got me real good.
We ain't gettin' out first.
- Attention, everybody.
The first person out is Sam.
He tripped, and I tagged him.
- That's so sad.
- No way.
- Yo, they caught somebody.
They caught somebody.
- Got the first personal.
- Oh no, Sam.
- Sorry, Sam.
Eight more people to go.
- Also, I'm tired and Chris is
gonna help me hunt you down.
- You're going down, Karl.
- Oh, no.
- Chris is gonna help?
We gotta find a better spot.
- Chris, do you know the game plan?
- No, not really.
- Tag people.
- Is it... okay.
- I'm under a trailer right now,
I'm about to move like further back
and let this thing just sitting here.
- All right, yeah.
Here's the stairs to the roof, baby.
- So, let's search this room first.
- Okay.
- And then we'll...
He left.
He just ran away.
- I know Jimmy was that way.
I haven't spotted Chris yet.
Not a, not a wild Chris.
- I feel like people
are gonna be on the
outsides 
There's so many people.
Move, Frank.
(laughing)
Oh God, they're so fast.
- Oh, oh.
Oh, they're running,
Jimmy, they were running.
Chris found somebody.
(screaming)
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Chris, oh, someone.
- Check this.
- Some people
went the other way!
- [Jimmy] They went the other way.
Chris!
- [Jimmy] No, why is there an end here?
- Chris!
Chris!
- Chris, help!
I'm in...
Oh, oh.
Wait for it.
- Wait, Chris.
- Oh my god.
(buzzer)
I got him.
Oh my god, we got him.
Sam, we brought you a partner.
Attention, everybody.
We officially caught the second person.
Mitch is now out.
- Mitch.
I was just with him.
No way, that was so close.
- Mitch didn't win a hundred grand.
- Hey, give, give me my picture back.
- Let's go take more money from people.
(intense music)
- You want him to finish?
- [Chris] Oh, ooh, I see.
(excited breathing)
There's like at least four.
- [Jimmy] I'm coming through,
I'm coming through, whoa.
- [Chris] Jimmy, yes, go that way.
- [Jimmy] Why is this locked?
This door's locked.
(pained groan)
- [Chris] Ah, that's my
knee I had surgery on.
- [Jimmy] Where did they go?
- That way.
- That way?
- Ah.
- I see them.
Come on, did they go in here?
It's locked.
All right, Chris, where you at?
Meet me at the front, right now, pronto.
- Roger, Delta.
(intense music)
- [Chris] Go, go, go, go, go.
(excited screaming)
(screaming)
(screaming)
(screaming)
(buzzer)
- [Jimmy] What happening?
- Literally circled around the tree
and I saw this yellow frickin' shirt.
- Chandler's currently on the roof.
He doesn't realize that
I saw him laying down.
I need you to go camp the
stairs of the roof for Chandler.
I'm gonna take him to jail, okay, break.
The stairs are that way.
- I knew that.
I knew that.
- Adam, we gotta be quick, come over here.
Adam has officially been caught.
Three down, there's seven remaining.
I'm coming for you.
All right, gotta go, Chandler the roof.
- I'm gonna go rogue and go
up there and get Chandler.
(intensifying music)
- [Chandler] You set me up, Jimmy!
- Chris, did you find him on the roof?
- In the back quadrant, east.
- This way.
(rapid music)
According to my calculations,
they should be around here.
(rapid music)
Fine, fine, I'll admit it.
My calculations were slightly off.
This is hard.
(screaming)
- [Camera man] Go Jim, go Jim.
- [Jimmy] Tell Chris, go to that door,
the front door, he's there.
(panting)
- [Camera man] Jimmy, he's gone.
Jimmy.
Jimmy, he's leaving.
You were so close.
- I was so close to dying,
do you hear my oxygen?
Nolan one got away,
he's on the Southeast four 90.
- Roger that.
- I don't know what that
means, I made it up.
- I don't know what that means at all.
- [Jimmy] I thought I'd find him here.
Nolan, how are you up there?
- I'm unstoppable.
- You go to quadrant two, I'm going up.
- Go, come on.
- [Chris] Oh, god.
- Stay back or I'll do it.
- You're not gonna jump.
(intense music)
He messed up the jump
pad, I can't get down.
He's at the jump pad, Jimmy.
Where are you?
- Chris, can you hear me?
- [Karl] Don't tell anybody,
I'm hiding under the money.
I'm under the money and
now I have Chandler.
There's no chance they'll ever find us,
we're gonna be final two.
- You don't think somebody
could get up on top of these, right?
(deep yawn)
You think these'll hold me?
I see him.
(startled shout)
(crashing)
- [Chris] That's so far.
Why are people jumping off the buildings?
What am I supposed to...
What?
No, the crash pad's not there.
What am I supposed to do,
jump off of a building?
- [Camera man] Ah, Chris
is stuck on the roof.
He needs, you.
- Take the stairs.
- No, no, no, like.
Like stuck, stuck.
- There's stairs.
- Not where he's at.
- Jimmy.
- Oh, stuck.
Wait, he was up there?
- Yeah.
- Let me guess, so it's curly-hair guy.
- Yeah.
- That curly hair guy
just seems extreme.
How'd you get up?
- Over there,
but now it's too scary to go down.
- You just keep scouting
while I go get a ladder.
After I got Chris off the roof,
Sapnap called us with an offer.
What did you say, Sapnap?
- How much money would you give me
if I told you exactly
where Karl is right now?
- What if I tweet out your channel
if you told me where he is?
- All right.
Karl is right beneath all the money.
(gasp)
- Chris, let's go, go.
Sapnap said he's beneath the money.
(intense music)
- Smells like Karl.
- It does smell like Karl.
You told me when I was on the
other side of the hospital,
I couldn't get him.
- A deals a deal, I told you where he was.
- [Jimmy] Karl was a dead end
but then I spotted Rick
on another rooftop.
What is with this guy and roofs?
Hey, hey Rick, don't move, don't move.
Stay there, I just want peace.
We can work something out.
- Okay, what are we talking?
- I tag you, you lose a hundred grand.
- No deal.
- This guy's sneaky,
be careful.
(intense music)
- He juked you up.
- Ooh, that's so close.
Shh.
- I'm literally looking right at you.
- [Chris] Jimmy, Jimmy, he's jumping.
- Is he jumpin'?
You oh... I got you.
(buzzer)
- Oh, god, it's deck.
- Oh.
- You good, man?
- Yeah, I'm good.
- Chris, come on down.
- Can you get that ladder?
- All right, welcome your new inmate.
(cheers)
- Come on in.
- Come on in, guy.
- Hey, guys, they got me.
- Rick has been found.
Also, I forgot to rip yours, as well.
- I think I played a good game.
I think I gave them all
a run for their money.
That's okay.
- You know how there's a
cafeteria in the hospital?
And I'm totally not gonna be
here so you can come get food.
- [Narrator] A few moments later.
(intensifying music)
- [Jimmy] Go, go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
Help me!
(laughs)
He's getting tired.
I thought the good old
walkie throw would work.
But now I just don't have a walkie talkie.
- My boys.
- Hey, can you get out?
- Oh, I see, okay.
- We're disguised all the way up.
Hiding inside of Jimmy's car.
They're not gonna know.
- Oh.
- There's no chance
they are gonna find us.
- I don't know if you could tell
but we were exhausted at this point.
Honestly, it's kind of fun
walking and enjoying the sunset with you.
- It is nice.
We don't do this very often.
- Should I get lower?
- Yeah, try to get lower.
- Someone in my car?
- He definitely see us?
- [Chris] Did you leave
your keys in your car?
- Three, two, one.
- Oh, oh, Jimmy go.
(laughs)
- [Chris] They just stole your car.
(laughs)
- [Jimmy] Oh, they're getting
out, they're getting out.
They're getting out, go, go, go, go.
(screams)
Catch up.
He's right there.
Go, go, go.
Go, go, get over...
(buzzer)
Got him!
Get me up over his body
or just fall down.
Here's your new prisoner.
(groans)
Now, before I put you in jail.
- Yes.
- Were you hiding under the money earlier
when Sapnap bribed you out?
- I was directly under that.
(laughs)
- So Sapnap was telling the truth?
- 100%.
- Sapnap, I love you.
Get in jail.
- Oh.
(laughs)
- Dude, how do I get out?
Look at these, these
are literally titanium.
- I know.
After jailing Karl
we thought things would
die down for a bit.
But out of nowhere,
Chris just found a bunch of people.
(intense music)
- Jimmy, come to the front.
I got Sapnap.
Go, go, go, go.
John, I got it, I got it, I got it.
- [Jimmy] Sapnap managed to
ditch Chris in the forest.
So we had to switch up our plans.
- [Chris] There's a ladder.
- He had another race.
I'm sure I'll see him again
sometime soon and do it again.
- Nolan is in the back parking lot.
- Oh shh, oh no.
- Oh, Nolan's in the back parking lot.
(intense music)
- Oh no!
- Tag, you're it.
(buzzer)
- I was lured.
- Yeah.
- Like an animal into a trap.
- Gentlemen.
- Oh.
- Welcome your new inmate.
(cheers)
Nolan, you're no longer rolling.
All right, you can enter.
- Nolan's not rolling.
- No!
- Nolan's not rolling.
Nolan's not rolling.
- Jordan, Chandler, Sapnap, and Chris
are the only four that remain.
In the middle of the hospital
is a briefcase full of $10,000.
You can come get this,
but if you do grab it,
you have to carry it around.
- 10,000 in the middle.
But somebody's gonna be waiting.
I know somebody's gonna be waiting.
- I'm not following for that.
I've been here too long
to know that's a trap.
- Karl, can I borrow you?
- Okay.
- Chris wiped out, here's the clip.
(laughs)
You didn't even see it.
Karl is searching with me,
he's filling in for Chris.
Chris hurt his leg.
We are constricting the
zone to just the hospital.
I'll give you guys like
five minutes to come inside.
Ready or not, here we come.
Karl, we haven't worked together much.
- Yes.
- You can point that down.
- We're gonna find somebody right now.
You know why?
'Cause I see you.
Maybe not.
'Cause I see you.
(screams)
There is a bug, there's a bug.
- Oh.
I want you to search that side,
I'll search this side.
Break on three.
Break on three, break on three.
- [Both] Break on three.
- Break on three.
'Cause I see you.
- Thank God I got rid of that nerd.
Chandler, where are you?
- I'm in the hospital.
- Hey, this is Tyler, make sure that you.
- Why is this sink running?
- 'Cause I see you.
(yells)
- No one.
Someone's under those stairs.
- They're right there, they're so close.
- Someone's definitely under these stairs.
- [Karl] 'Cause I see them.
- Karl, oh.
- Hey.
- [Jimmy] Where are you?
- Oh, come on out, I see you.
(laughs)
(buzzer)
It's the worst spot ever.
- Where was I supposed to
go in this wretched place?
- Taylor, you're fast.
You should've just been running around.
- Oh yeah.
- Oh.
Saw other people hiding,
so I thought that was the strat.
- Oh yeah?
So where'd you
see them hiding?
- Definitely not where?
- Not in the cafeteria?
- No.
- Could you just
sit down real quick?
- So.
- We're gonna?
(upbeat music)
- Oh, this cafeteria's ginormous.
(screams)
- They finally got me.
- There's no running, no.
(buzzer)
- Yay!.
The two fastest people made it easy on us
by hiding in confined
spaces instead of running.
We did in fact catch Chandler.
(shocked cheers)
Hey, and wait, wait.
- They got me.
- We caught Chris.
- The got me.
- Hop on in, hop on in.
Boom, boom.
Karl, I need you to go back in jail.
- Welcome back, buddy.
- Welcome back.
- I hate him.
These last two people, I'm
gonna hunt all by myself.
Jordan and Sapnap.
I'd like you to know
that I'm standing in front
of the $100,000 in cash
and only one of you is getting it.
Now your boys all on his own.
(crack)
There goes the flashlight.
If I was Sapnap, where would I hide?
Not there.
Interesting.
Someone is using the bathroom?
You know, it'd be kinda weird
to catch someone in the bathroom.
Nope.
This hospital is huge.
Breach.
(intense music)
This hospital is ginormous and
there's only two people left.
I bet you one of them's around here.
(squeak)
(intensifying music)
Did you see that door?
Wait, that door moved.
That door did move.
Wait, hold on.
That door moved.
Someone in here?
I see you.
It's a lie.
I was hoping
if they were back there,
they would say something.
- I can't believe I got away from him,
my plan worked beautifully.
- I heard someone, dude, I heard someone.
The door moving, I heard noise.
Yeah, we're on someone's tail.
Who is it?
Sapnap am I on your tail or is it Jordan?
Who am I around?
Not feeling very talkative?
(screams)
(screams)
- [Camera man] Oh, got
her, go Jimmy, go Jimmy.
(indistinct)
(screaming)
- She locked herself
in the men's bathroom.
- Am I allowed to kick down
a door in the hospital?
All right, fine.
Jordan, I'll leave you be.
I'm gonna go look for Sapnap.
(heavy footsteps)
- [Walkie Talkie Voice] Desmond,
we're out on the grip truck
and we have a sledge hammer.
(screams)
(screams)
- I got her, I got her.
(buzzer)
(panting)
Jordan, I don't want you
to walk home with nothing.
So we're still gonna give you $10,000
even though you didn't win.
You just won 10,000.
Kid, all right.
Sapnap, congratulations,
I just found Jordan
which means you just won $100,000.
- Yes, thank you so much.
Let's go.
I found somebody and they are Jordan.
- No!
Join us, join us, join us.
- Sapnap, please meet me at the prison.
- Yo, he's over here?
(laughs)
- Congratulations, Sapnap.
Do you want to call Dream
and tell him you won a hundred grand?
- Yeah, I'll call him.

fMfipiV_17o,"- This is a bathtub full of snakes.
Hey there, little guy.
(snake hissing)
If any of you sits in this tub of snakes,
I'll give your mom $10,000-
- [Chandler] Oh, sorry mom.
(buzzer rings)
(group laughing)
- He didn't even let
me finish and he left.
Like I said, if either of you
sit in this tub of snakes,
I'll give your mom 10 grand.
- Are you gonna wanna do it?
- [Karl] Dude, your mom's
gonna be so excited. (chuckles)
- And this is Brian, our
professional snake handler.
You wanna go ahead and
throw the first snake on?
- [Brian] Let's go!
- That was really professional.
- [Brian] I know.
(Chris yells)
(Jimmy laughing)
- He's kind of constricting a little bit.
Is this okay?
- Are you ready for the next 20 snakes?
- There's 20?
- 20 more.
The snakes are trying to
steal the 10 grand, look!
There, he's, look at him!
Congratulations! Your
mom just won 10 grand.
- Let's go
- This box has $15,000 in it
and some giant cockroaches on top of it.
Karl, as much money as you
can grab, you can keep.
- No chance, dude.
- Jeff, if you could come on over here.
This is Jeff, our sound guy.
- Hi guys.
- Jeff, can I have your mic?
- Yeah?
- I think you see where
I'm going with this.
- Oh, gosh!
- Jeff, however much money
you grab out of this box
in the next 60 seconds, you keep.
Okay, all right? That's like 500 bucks.
I forgot to start the timer,
so I'm just gonna count in
my head, I'd say 50 seconds.
Oh watch out for the cockroach!
(Jeff yells)
(boys laugh)
Yo! His hand just touched
my hand and it was sweaty.
By the way, you got like 35 seconds left.
- Oh my god!
- Well I'm just gonna count down from ten.
- Oh no!
- Nine, eight, I'm a little bored,
five, three,
two, two.
I'll give you an extra second
if you pet a cockroach.
(suspenseful music)
And one - boom!
You won $9,340. Congratulations!
(all chuckling)
This is a one pound dumbbell.
Can you curl it?
(fake arm crunching sound)
And Chris, every time you curl
this I'll give you a dollar.
- Really?
- No.
But, every time Noah,
come on in here, curls it
I'll give him a dollar.
A dollar.
I'm just gonna throw it
on the floor. Dollar.
Dollar. Here try curling it faster.
Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom.
Oh this is hard to keep up with.
You can literally go as long as you want
and make as much money as you want.
- Oh don't test me. I can be
here for days if you want.
- [Jimmy] Oh really?
(boys laughing)
All right, let's see it.
- Won't stop, can't stop.
I was built for it. I'm
winning a million dollars.
- Tareq, if you let this tarantula
crawl on you for 30 seconds
I'll give your mom $10,000.
And we even brought his
mom to cheer him on!
- Yeah, Tareq, you can do it!
- Yeah, mom, thank you.
(chuckling nervously)
- [Chris] What's your safe word?
- Safe word is: Get this spider off of me!
- Tareq, if it bites you
we'll double the money.
Does that make you feel better?
- Oh no!
- I can say that cuz
it's not gonna bite him.
All right, time started.
- [Tareq] Stay calm, it won't move.
(Tareq's mom talking indistinctly)
Okay, all right. Mom-
(mom gasping)
- [Chris] It can sense fear.
- [Jimmy] Tareq, you're
a whole five seconds in.
- [Tareq] Okay-
- Oh!
- Just five more seconds.
Oh oh oh!
Just five more seconds!
- You're almost at 30 seconds.
- [Mom] Go! Go-
- You're almost there, Tareq!
- You're almost there.
- You're literally almost there-
- So close!
- [Mom] Tareq! (indistinct)
- He's so close.
(all laughing)
- [Jimmy] All right.
(multiple people screaming and laughing)
- Yay, Tareq!
(all clapping)
(mom laughing excitedly)
- Yeah! I did that!
- Thank you, Mr. Beast,
for letting the spider crawl on Tareq.
(Tareq laughing)
- If you could stand
right here. Thank you.
- Okay?
Why am I standing right
here? Why? (chuckling)
Hello?
- Karl, I have a random contestant here,
and if you guess the code
to that safe in the room,
she gets what's inside.
- Okay?
- Try to get in. Stop laying on the floor!
- You're so lazy!
- Chandler, can you do that thing?
- [Chandler] Yeah, I got it.
- [Karl] I've-
(slams against wall)
- Oh and Karl, one thing
I forgot to mention
is every 10 seconds we're
putting a rat in the room.
- Stop! Actually?
- Chandler! Another one.
It's been like five seconds
and I like to round up.
- [Karl] Is there cheese on the safe?
- There is, in fact, cheese on the safe.
(Karl banging on the safe)
- [Karl] Oh my god!
(suspenseful music)
- I'll give you a hint.
See that giant rat to your right?
- [Karl] Yep.
- [Jimmy] Uh, we put
the code underneath him.
- No, you didn't...
- You're right, we didn't, that was a lie.
(Karl and contestant laughing nervously)
But the code does have something
to do with your birthday.
- [Chris] Karl, oh! Look at that rat-
- [Karl] Holy shi-
(all laughing)
All around me!
- What do you think the code is, Karl?
I wanna help you out.
- You said it's my birthday.
- Well...what's taking you so long.
- Karl, go! I want you to go faster! Go!
- [Karl] It was wrong!
- How 'bout you try the
day after your birthday?
Maybe that'll work.
- Jimmy.
(safe beeping)
- Oh! I meant the day
before your birthday. Sorry.
- [Karl] Oh my go-
- He got it!
Oh, Mary! See what's inside!
- Is that- Is that mine?
- Earlier today I broke
into Chandler's house
and stole his teddy bear.
(Karl laughing)
- [Chandler] That's mine. That's Flash-
- Chandler's stuffed animal aside,
there's $20,000 in that safe.
And congratulations-
- Shut up!
Shut up!
- [Jimmy] you just got it!
- Yeah, let's go!
- Oh my God! Thank you so much, Karl.
- Of course!
- We're now back at the snake set,
but instead of a tub of snakes,
we have a tub of pickles.
(Karl giggling)
Oh my gosh, it smells so bad.
(Chris smacking pickles)
(Jimmy punching pickles)
(fire exploding)
(pickles squishing)
Oh stop stop!
- Why does this exist?
- If you remember in this video
Chandler wouldn't eat a pickle for $5,000.
He's terrified of pickles.
Chandler, come here.
The pickles aren't gonna jump at you.
Which are you more afraid
of - pickles or snakes?
- [Chandler] Pickles.
- That is the dumbest
thing I've ever heard.
(all laughing)
- I was gonna offer your sister 10 grand
for you to sit into it.
But, if you do it in the next minute,
I'll give your sister $20,000
if you sit in this tub of pickles.
- Okay, just think of like a McDouble
without pickles and no onions.
- Or just think it's 20 grand!
- For someone who might lose 20 grand,
you seem kinda chill.
- I'm kinda used to it at this point.
(all laughing)
- All right, 20 seconds-
- C'mon, Chandler, you can do this.
Just think of all the times.
- Ahh!
- [Cassidy] You can do this, Chandler-
- [Chris] Chandler, I love you.
(Chandler screams)
- You can do it!
You can do it!
- [Jimmy] 10 seconds!
She pushed him in!
- [Chandler] Ew!
(boys laughing)
(Chandler squealing)
Five!
A little bit more...
- Get me out!
(everyone laughing)
All right. We'll count it! We'll count it!
(all laughing)
- [Cassidy] Aww, Chandler!
(boys laughing)
(Chandler gagging)
- [Karl] Cassidy, your brother ran away.
- I knew if I didn't raise it to 20 grand,
there was zero chance he would do it.
- I was thinking the same thing.
- Finally! He pulled
through and won you $20,000.
- I love you!
(boys laughing)
(exciting music)
- Noah! Holy crap!
How much has he done?
- About 20,000.
- What?!
- 20,000 curls.
- I can help you out.
But I'm gonna need to
grab some of that cash.
I got an idea. I'll be back.
- [Jimmy] Okay. All right.
We'll check in with that later...
Nolan, do you remember when
Karl beat you in coconut bowling
and stole an island from you?
(pins colliding)
- [Karl] Booyah!
- That island cost $800,000.
Karl, can you open my microwave?
In this microwave is $8,000.
One percent of the island.
And if you can beat Karl
in a push-up battle,
I'll let you have one
percent of the island.
- Why is it in a microwave? (chuckles)
- Why are you not in a microwave?
(microwave beeping)
Gentlemen, get in positions.
On my count: One...
Do it.
- Oh!
Before we do the seventh,
Nolan, think about the island he cost you.
- You don't stand a chance!
This is payback for bowling!
- Oh, also Karl, if you win
I'll give you the eight grand.
- [Karl] Oh, okay!
- [Nolan] No!
- Seven...
(intense music)
All right, we're in the double digits.
No- Hey, hey, no savvy, no savvy-
- [Nolan] Whoa!
- That's not savvy-
- You're just gonna stand?
- All right.
- What was he gonna do to me?
- 16...
(intense music)
17...
- [Karl] I can't. I can't.
- Oh! Let's go!
(Karl groaning)
You lose!
- Nolan, (indistinct) let
me just step over Karl,
sorry you didn't win this money...
Here you go! You can just take it home-
- Cool!
- Enjoy your microwave.
This is our next contestant Randy.
Basically, earlier
today, I put out a Tweet
and I asked a thousand people
to come to this auditorium-
- Oh-
- and sit in the stands.
So there's a thousand people
out there right now. Okay?
- Okay.
(Jimmy laughing)
- Hey Randy, if you read
this script in front of them,
I'll give you $10,000 in cash.
- Okay, I'll do it.
(both laughing)
(intense music)
(audience chattering)
Thanks for coming out.
I really need your undivided attention
for the next...
three minutes.
I'm going to be talking about
why YouTube is better than everything.
It has A Dream and PewDiePie.
Jacksepticeye... (nervously chuckles)
septiceye and many others.
Now stay with me!
- It's pronounced Pew-Dee-Pie.
- I can't believe he's
actually doing this.
The script we wrote is so stupid.
- Also, can I get a ""Hoya!""-
- Hoya!
- Hoya!
Thanks for coming out
- [Chris] You're welcome!
- All right what'd you think of it?
- It was fun.
It was, it was, it was not
what I expected to read,
but...
(boys laughing)
- And before I give you this $10,000,
walk out here,
I wanted to introduce
you to the actual crowd.
(Randy laughs)
What you were speaking to was
actually a thousand mannequins
and Chris and Karl.
- Hi!
- Hi!
- And there's your $10,000 in cash.
- I have no idea what to do...
(Randy crying)
I'm giving all this money to my mom
and part of it to Mary Beth.
(Randy chuckling)
I told her I was gonna give her some.
I just, thanks for the opportunity.
I can't stop shaking.
- [Jimmy] Now let's see where Chris went
with all that money from the gym.
- All right, we're headed to Best Buy.
I'm gonna get Noah a Theragun.
It costs $400, which is a lot.
But I think it's gonna
make him so much more money
if he gets that arm worked
out, ya know what I'm saying?
Oh wait, that one's $600.
I don't think we need the $600 one.
I've returned.
Now let's watch this man get instantly
thousands of more dollars.
- That feels like another 20 grand to me.
- You're just gonna stay
here and massage him?
- Frank!
You know how you were a cameraman?
- Yeah.
- You're now a massage man.
- Now we're gonna massage your arm,
so you can curl more weights,
so you can take more money.
This is weird. Next bit.
One of these four paintings costs $10,000.
See if you can guess which one.
I'll give you three seconds.
(light happy music)
If you guessed this one, you're an idiot.
It's not this one.
This was painted by Karl.
- [Karl] Yo that's kind of dope.
- This was painted by Chris.
(paintbrush slashing)
This was painted by Chandler.
(paint farting)
And this was a $10,000 painting
we bought from a professional painter.
Ashley, there are four paintings here.
This sounds weird, but one of
these paintings costs $10,000
and three of them cost nothing.
And if you guess which one
is the $10,000 painting,
I'll let you keep it.
Go ahead and start analyzing them.
- [Ashley] Oh man...
- [Chris] I know...
It's very easy...
- [Karl] It's the one that has
the most artistic integrity.
- I'm gonna go with this one.
- [Jimmy] This one?
- [Ashley] Yeah-
- [Jimmy] Are you sure?
You don't want to think about it anymore?
- I'm going with my gut-
- Okay-
- I'm going with that one.
- So you think this is
the $10,000 painting.
- I think I do.
- I hate to break the news to you
but Chris actually drew this.
- I'm really good-
- [Ashley] Did you?
- Yeah!
- Yeah.
- [Ashley] You did a good job!
- [Chris] Thank you!
- [Jimmy] Chris!
(Ashley laughing)
You should be a professional artist.
Technically, Ashley,
you just lost 10 grand.
(sad music)
- All right.
- I feel kinda bad so I'm gonna
let you pick one more time.
Last chance.
If you get it this time,
I'll let you keep it.
- Okay, I think I'm
gonna go with that one.
- [Karl] This one?
- [Jimmy] Wait, that one?
(painting crashing)
- 50-50 now.
- [Jimmy] All right, we're
giving you one more chance.
(Ashley laughing)
Which do you think this man didn't draw?
- Let's go with this one.
- So you think this is
the $10,000 painting?
- I think this is the $10,000 painting.
(Jimmy sighs)
- This was also drawn by Chandler.
(Ashley laughing)
This. Right here.
Was the $10,000 painting.
Honestly, if it makes you feel better,
you literally couldn't have picked worse.
- Yeah I did a really good job with that.
- I'm really bad when people lose.
Can you just fist pump me?
All right, I'm gonna head out.
This is Foy.
- How y'all doing?
- I have a rope here and I'm
gonna have you play tug-of-war.
Foy, of those three gentlemen right there,
who would you like to play
in a game of tug-of-war
for $10,000?
- [Foy] I'm thinking Karl.
- It's pronounced, it's Chris.
- So you wanna play Karl in
tug-of-war for ten grand?
- [Foy] For ten grand, absolutely.
- [Jimmy] All right.
(boys laughing)
Three...two...one...Go!
(intense music)
(Jimmy laughing)
You got $10,000, but before you celebrate,
do you want to risk your
$10,000 and do double or nothing
and throw another person over there?
But if you lose, you lose it all.
- Double or nothing.
- Double or nothing?-
- Let's go for it.
- All right well then pick.
Who do you want the second person to be?
- [Foy] I'm more for
Chandler because I don't...
The socks.
- What are those???
- Three...two...one...Go!
(suspenseful music)
(boys grunting)
Oh! Whoa!
- [Chris] You gotta...you
gotta get Chandler in!
- [Jimmy] Yeah! (clapping)
Oh, congratulations!
(Foy cheering)
Now you have $20,000 in cash.
And you know what I'm about to ask you.
- All three?
To be honest with you,
it feels like I'm
bleeding inside my chest.
(boys laughing)
I'm done.
- So you're gonna take the 20 grand?
- I'm gonna take the 20.
- Okay-
- So what...
you're saying is you're scared of me.
- No, he's saying he's scared of Chris.
- Yeah!
(Chris grunts)
- Please subscribe to Mr. Beast.
Had a good time. Y'all can too.
- Noah, buddy. We're back!
You seem to be curling pretty slow.
(Noah chuckles)
- Honestly man, I can't
feel my arm at this point.
- [Jimmy] Oh really?
Dave, what's he at.
- $32,000.
- $32,000.
- I know I said 100,000 million
but let me tell you
something, I got humbled.
(boys laughing)
- The pink dumbbell of death
is finally getting to him.
In this trash bag is $20,000.
Do you wanna risk your $30,000
to try and curl this 20 pound dumbbell?
A if you do I'll give you an extra $20,000
and we call it a night.
- I gotta risk it.
- You're gonna-
- Risk it for the biscuit!
- Play the intense music.
20 grand on the line. Can he do it?
(intense music)
- [Chris] I got the sack.
- [Jimmy] Oh. It's going so slow...
- [Chris] You can do it.
- [Jimmy] Come on. Come on.
- [Chris] You can do it.
- [Jimmy] A little bit more.
Come on! Come on!
- [Chris] You can do it!
- [Jimmy] That looks like a curl to me-
- [Chris] I don't know what
makes it a curl or not.
(Chris and Jimmy talking
over each other indistinctly)
- [Noah] Please tell me that's one.
- [Chris And Jimmy] You won $20,000!
- [Jimmy] On top of your 32 grand,
you just won another 20 grand!
Noah, what's going through your mind?
- Honestly, it's surreal.
It's hard to fathom
how much money this is.
- This is Regina. And do you
know why you're in this room?
- No.
(both laughing)
- Sorry for dragging
you in this weird room.
If you don't mind-
Can you guys be normal for five seconds?
- I haven't moved a muscle.
- If you wouldn't mind, can
you put this blindfold on?
- Okay.
- [Jimmy] As you remember, there
was a balloon in this room.
So I'm gonna put this nail
in your hand, right there.
I'm gonna have the boys move the balloon
to a random part of the room.
Inside this balloon is
keys to a brand new car.
If you pop that balloon without
taking off your blindfold
in the next 60 seconds,
you'll get to keep the car.
I'm gonna start the timer now-
- Okay.
- Go for it.
That's a wall.
- [Chris] Cold!
- [Jimmy] That is a wall.
(Regina chuckling)
Cold.
- Oh gosh.
- Warm.
(Regina laughing nervously)
- [Boys] Oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh you got it!
(Regina screaming and cheering)
- [Jimmy] You got it! All
right, here here here here,
wait wait wait wait, can I have this?
- Oh, yes-
- All right, it's over! Yay!
(everyone cheering)
If you look right here you'll
see the key that came out.
Go for it.
Conveniently, the car's
right out back. Follow me.
(Karl cheering)
Here is a brand new car.
Wow!
- Oh my god!
I just won a car!
- [Chris] Let's go.
(all cheering and clapping)
- [Karl] You popped a balloon for it!
(horn honking)

ayXxwJJId_c,"- This is the most expensive
mystery box in the world.
And I also bought a $5,000 mystery box.
This $10,000 mystery box,
a $25,000 mystery box,
and a $100,000 mystery box.
And all of the mystery boxes you see here
cost over $500,000.
- That's a lot of cheddar.
- And we're gonna open
every single one of them,
starting with this $100 mystery box.
- Oh, there's glass in here.
- All right, let's see what's inside.
- Smell my nuts.
- Wait.
- It's a candle that smells like nuts.
Not my nuts, it doesn't
smell like my nuts.
- Nature's nuts.
- Nature's nuts.
- Here's a $300 mystery box,
and Karl, right there, it's a $400 one.
- [Karl] See ya.
- Let's go open 'em.
Gentleman.
- Huh?
- Mhmm.
- Get to opening.
- Oh my bad.
- All right.
We're not speed running
opening these boxes.
All right, he's ripping it.
Bob Ross Monopoly.
This box is better.
- Wait guys, wait, wait.
- The $300 mystery box was a Bob Ross set.
What was in the $400 one?
- Whole lot of magic stuff.
- Let us know if you'd rather have
a bunch of Bob Ross memorabilia,
or a bunch of magical stuff.
- Bob Ross.
- And if you thought these
mystery boxes are cool,
wait for the 250,000 box
at the end of the video.
- [Chris] I can't wait to see it.
- This is a $500 mystery box,
and your mom gets what's inside.
- My mom.
- Is it weird that I'm always
giving your mom things?
- Yeah, yeah it is.
- What did your mom get?
- [All] Whoa
- Headphones.
Yo, I take it back, I'm your mom now.
Now I want 'em.
Right there gentlemen, right there.
Okay.
- It's heavy.
- This is 700 bucks.
- Wow.
There's a knife right there.
- Yeah, I'm weak.
- What?
- [Chris] What?
This is all just Chick-fil-A sauce.
There's no way this is worth $700.
In two days, these go out of date.
This one goes out of date today.
- Well, get to eatin.
I think this would be
a good time to mention.
I don't recommend you buy mystery boxes.
The same company that made this box
also made our a hundred
thousand dollars box,
and our quarter of a million dollar box.
250 grand is a lot of money.
Now we're starting to
get to the fun stuff.
This is $1000 mystery crate.
That's right, when you get above $1000,
they turn into crates.
- What the heck?
- How do you think we should
get it down from there?
I can't carry that.
- Yeah.
- I can't carry it.
Okay, it looks like they're just dropping.
- What?
- No way.
- [Chandler] I love fortune cookies.
- It's all fortune cookies.
- Oh, Karl, the box is falling, Karl.
How did they even buy $1000
worth of fortune cookies?
Our next mystery box was so big
we had to move it with a forklift.
And for some reason we let Karl drive.
- I'm in a forklift.
Oh, Jimmy.
- [MrBeast] Inside the $2,000
mystery box was a bunch
of whips for me and the boys.
- Yeah!
- Go, go, go.
This is a $2,500 mystery box
which is literally 1% the
cost of the giant mystery box,
and also 1% the size.
- That's what she said.
- It looks like this mystery
box was made by Sircastle.
Their logo is a star flexing.
I don't know.
All right, let's see.
Oh, these are sneakers.
All right, Chandler
and Chris, I need help.
- Oh, they're custom painted!
Look at that!
They're Super Mario custom painted.
- They have everyone's name on 'em.
This has your name on it.
- Oh! Oh!
- I obviously told these
companies we were ordering these,
so they made us each custom shoes.
- Dude, the mix Supreme Louis Vuitton.
- McDonald's.
There's a note from them.
So we wanted to take some of your interest
and allow you to express them
to the world with your shoes.
Lame.
That was a joke, I love you.
This mystery box costs $5,000,
and all we got was this action figure,
and it usually sells for only $350.
Next box!
This is a $9,000 mystery box,
which by the way is a weird price.
Why would you not just
round up to 10 grand?
And to open it up, I
brought some pickaxes.
And this box is where the real fun begins.
This is the equivalent to a car.
And because this box is worth
the same as a Honda Civic,
please be careful.
(heavy rock music)
- Wait, it needs one more good smack.
- Nice, this is clearly-
- Holy grail.
- Oh my gosh.
That's a dope poster of LeBron.
Is this signed by LeBron?
Don't run away with it.
- Should we not have hit this with an ax?
- LeBron James.
- It turns out between the poster,
the signed ball, the game worn jersey,
and the rookie card,
this box is actually worth $8,500,
so just short of what we paid.
This ginormous box is $10,000.
And so is this box,
even though it's half the size,
and I don't know how,
but this one also costs $10,000.
Pick what you want.
- I want this one.
- Wait, what if I want that one?
- What if I want it?
- I need all three of you gentlemen
to stand in the bathroom.
- But it's stinky in there.
- You guys got it.
- [Chandler] Three dudes in a bathroom.
- [Chris] Why are you standing?
- This is Chris's sister,
Karl's brother and Chandler's brother.
I might have locked your
brothers in a bathroom,
just ignore it.
And before I locked him in the bathroom
I had them pick which
$10,000 mystery crate
you guys would get.
Chandler picked this one, Zach for you.
- [Zach] Oh, okay.
- Chris picked this one,
and Sean, Karl picked the little one
- Huh? Great.
Of course.
- Everyone keep in mind it's expensive,
and you keep what's inside.
Wait, did you get yours open?
- Yeah.
- [MrBeast] Wait, what's in yours?
- PSA 7 Charizard.
That's sick!
- What is in Zach's $10,000 mystery crate?
I don't know.
- [Zach] Oh my gosh.
- [MrBeast] What?
- [Zach] It's fireworks.
- Oh my goodness.
At the end of this video,
after we opened that $250,000 crate,
we'll launch the fireworks.
The boys were getting a little reckless
locked in the bathroom.
They ended up breaking out
and ruining the surprise.
- [Chris] Wait a minute, that's my sister.
What is my sister doing here?
- [MrBeast] Oh my gosh.
- Whoa.
This is a power glove.
- It's a glove.
- Complete in-box Nintendo
entertainment system.
This ginormous crate is
a $25,000 mystery box.
And this is Sam, say hi.
- Hey guys, how you doing?
- Dead serious, I paid
$25,000 for this mystery box
and you get to keep whatever is inside.
- Okay, that sounds about right.
Man, I'm pumped up, let's get out here.
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go baby!
- What do you think is here?
- Man, man, dude, I don't know.
Maybe a toy car or something.
Maybe car bed?
Hey!
- That sentence was all over
the place, but I love it.
- Okay, oh, oh, oh, he just dropped it.
Oh snap!
- It's a gaming setup!
- It's a gaming setup.
I ain't had a system since
Xbox 360 original series,
I ain't even lying to you.
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ultimate computers.
- I don't even know how
to use computer that well.
- Sam, we did the math,
and all this stuff you see here
that you've got in your crate,
we estimate is worth
between 30 and $40,000.
For our $50,000 mystery box,
we decide to do something
a little different.
Basically I gave Dream $50,000
to put whatever he wanted in this crate.
Literally the only people that know
what's inside this crate is Dream,
and the mystery box
company he worked with.
And I told Dream this
crate was for me, correct?
- [Dream] Yes.
- Okay. I lied.
I actually have one of your fans here,
and I'm gonna let your fan
keep whatever's in this crate.
So I hope you didn't buy
a bunch of dumb stuff.
Yep.
- [Dream] Oh no.
- Alex is gonna keep whatever
you put in this giant crate.
- [Dream] I hope you like what's in it.
- I hope I do too.
- There we go.
- [Alex] All right.
- Do you wanna stomp on his face?
- Honestly.
- Let's open up the crate.
What's inside the Dream crate?
- Holy crap.
Nutella?
- Dream, what is this
car slash, what is this?
- Oh yeah, it's a Slingshot.
- It looks like a Batmobile.
What noise is it making?
- It's just-
(explosion booming)
- In this briefcase is $10,000,
and if you're subscribed to us
when you pull up our channel,
I'll give it to you.
- I am subscribed.
- He is subscribed!
Well, on top of all this,
you just got $10,000 in cash.
- All right, so I got a new car,
$10,000, a freaking wifi grill.

- Adam, how much do you
think this crate costs?
- I don't have any idea, but it's huge.
So it has to be worth a lot.
50K?
- This is $100,000 custom mystery box.
And I have an offer for you.
This is a bag full of $25,000,
and I wanna know,
would you rather have this $25,000,
or what's in this $100,000 mystery box?
- Yeah, let's go with the box!
Let's go with the big box!
Let's go!
- Adam, I hope this
doesn't make you nervous
but the $1,000 mystery box
was just fortune cookies.
I got faith, dude.
- Okay, like it.
- I got faith.
- He's got faith.
- I got faith.
- He's got faith.
- I got faith.
- He's got faith.
- [Adam] Timber!
- It's a box in a box.
- There's another box.
- Right now, this is kind
of nail biting, dude.
I'm not gonna lie like right now.
- Moment of truth.
Wait, Chris, wait, wait.
Oh, alright.
It's open.
There's a lot to take in here.
- Hype!
This is straight HYPEBEAST stuff.
This is sick.
Dude, hold on.
Bro, I've been trying to
find out pair SB's forever,
dude, what.
- Looks like he knows what this is.
- Oh, dude!
Dude!
- [Chris] The Demon Slayer PS5.
- Plus a Supreme PS5.
- And then how about just a normal PS5?
(Adam screams)
- [Adam] What the frick!
- I offer you Jimmy's $25,000
for some of the shoes.
- Bet.
- Pleasure doing business with you, man.
- No problem. Anybody else?
- Frank? You wanna buy some shoes?
I guess we're all just buying shoes.
- You like shoes,
you're wearing shoes right now, baby.
Get a picture of this.
Let me see, let me just see this first.
Hey Fred, anything go back.
Yeah.
Let me check.
- And that was cool and all,
but now it is time to open
the quarter of a million
dollar mystery box.
This $250,000 mystery box is so big
that they couldn't ship it to our studio
and had to build it in our warehouse.
Cue the lights.
Boom.
This mystery box was made by MSCHF,
and we have a representative
here from them.
His face is blurred because
they're very secretive.
How did you guys make this?
- The contents of this box were shipped
from all across the country
over the last two months.
- As far as we know,
the world's largest and
most expensive mystery box.
- And most mysterious mystery box.
- I have no idea what's inside.
3, 2, 1 press the button.
Oh, all right, then we pull.
- [Chandler] Do we pull?
- [Karl] Pull!
- It's falling, it's
falling, it's falling.
- [Karl] What?
- What? Oh, that wind.
Wait, it's a Lamborghini!
- [Karl] It's a Lamborghini!
- There's dust in my eyes,
oh, there's dust in my eyes.
Why of all the times would
there be dust in my eyes.
- [Karl] Wait, this is
a Lamborghini tractor.
- [MrBeast] Wait, what?
- Lamborghini started as
a tractor manufacturer,
fun fact.
- I dunno why they're
freaking out about that,
this is a Lamborghini!
- I didn't know there were
leaf blowers in there!
(Lamborghini engine roars)
- Oh my gosh, did you hear that?
- [Chandler] There we go.
That's on, now it's on.
- Yo, wait.
It's low on gas.

9bqk6ZUsKyA,"- I'm gonna spend the next 50 hours
buried alive in this coffin.
Probably the dumbest thing I've ever done.
Boys seal me up!
Welcome to my coffin!
I have a camera here,
here, down by my feet.
(loud thumping)
Oh, stop!
- All right, we're set.
(dramatic music)
- Boys, can you hear me?
- [Chandler] Yes, over.
- Burry me alive.
- All right.
(ominous music)
- This is terrifying.
Oh my gosh!
(Chris huffing)
I can like feel the weight
of the dirt on top of me.
- [Chris] Hey bud!
- Hi!
- [Chris] This is the last
time you're gonna see us
on the outside world.
- Good.
(intense dramatic music)
(excavator engine roaring)
- [Karl] Oh, here it comes!
- I heard Karl yell here it comes.
So I assume something's about to happen.
- [Chris] Yeah!
Is it full?
- [Chandler] No!
- All right, time-lapse!
(intense dramatic music)
- [Karl] Lower it a bit.
- [Chris] Drop!
I'm getting it off.
There you go, it's off.
- The tombstone has been placed?
- Yeah! Very, very gently placed.
(tombstone smashing)
- That means the challenge
has officially begun.
I'm going to spend the
next 50 hours buried alive.
I'm terrified (laughs).
Can you approve I'm buried
underground currently?
(feet thumping)
Or step on me, that works as well.
Gentlemen, go look at
the trunk of Tareq's car.
- Why are we going to your car?
- [Karl] Guys, I don't think that's...
(electric spark rattling)
(Chandler yelling)
(Chris yelling)
- If for whatever reason I get out early,
you guys get to tase me.
- What part of your
body do you want tased?
- [Jimmy] I don't know. Where
do people normally get tased?
- The balls.
- Is it bad that I kind
of already have to pee?
It's literally only been like an hour.
Whenever I do these challenges,
people are always like,
""Fake! You didn't show us
how you used the bathroom.""
Listen, you guys wanna know? This is how.
I'll be back in a second.
I feel much better now.
- All right, Jimmy.
(gentle music)
Goodnight, Jimmy.
And in case you're curious
on how Jimmy isn't dying right now,
we have an AC that goes
straight to his coffin,
we're monitoring him at all times
and we have a medic on standby.
- [Medic] He'll be fine.
- Until he gets tased.
(upbeat music)
- Good morning, gamers.
It looks like I survived the
first night period alive.
There's a fly down here.
How did you get down here?
I'm buried alive!
- Hey Jimmy!
Wake up Jimmy!
- Wake up!
- Guys, it's almost 1 PM, I've been up.
- Wake up!
- If I respond, it's
only gonna encourage it.
- Okay, I have to pee,
I'm peeing on your grave.
- I'd rather you not.
What if it seeps into my coffin.
(slow bouncy music)
Chris.
Chris, don't pee on me.
- Hey Jimmy, can you hear this?
(water pouring)
- Is he actually peeing on me, Karl?
- It's a much worse noise
than a taser, Jimmy.
- What are you gonna do about it?
You're in a hole, nerd.
No more talking to you.
Bye!
All right.
Now we don't have to
deal with him anymore.
(upbeat music)
- I thought I'd be
getting emotional support.
Maybe they'd play me a book
through the walkie-talkie
but no, they're just peeing on my grave.
(upbeat music)
Hey Chris?
- [Chris] Yeah.
- What does it feel like to stand?
I can't remember.
- Well, currently right now
it feels like I'm sitting
but I'll let you know
when I start to stand.
- I hate him.
- Hey Karl.
- Yeah, what's up Chris?
- Do you want to go get like a drink
and maybe some pizza or something?
- Jimmy, do you want anything?
(walkie-talkie beeping)
- We can win this war, man.
We can be way more annoying.
(Karl laughs)
(cell phone ringing)
- See? They never stop.
They're so annoying.
Shut up.
- Oh hello Jimmy, there's a train coming.
(train clacking)
- If you open up the
back of the walkie-talkie
you'll see batteries.
And if you just take those batteries out,
the idiots' noise stops.
I bet they still think I'm listening.
♪ I'm a gummy bear ♪
- Today I'm gonna be pooping
inside of a small box,
nine-foot underground.
Hey, Jimmy, answer!
- Is Chris jumping on me?
Let me put the batteries back in.
I pulled the batteries
out of the walkie-talkie
like 30 minutes ago.
- That's cheating!
- I heard the fly.
Did I tell you about my
pet fly I met last night?
- No. Tell me about it.
I'm interested.
- You're not interested.
You're gonna cut me off the moment I.
(walkie-talkie exploding)
(upbeat music)
- (groans) I wanna move
around, but I can't.
Why are coffin so small?
Just trapped in a box deep underground.
I think it's really starting to hit me.
I'm gonna go explore the
other side of the coffin.
Wish me luck.
(head thuds) Ow!
All right. Let's make this journey.
(various objects clacking)
(groans) Can you see me?
Yo, can I pick this
camera up with my toes?
Oh my gosh.
Yeah, that was the coolest
thing I've ever done.
I made it to the other side of the coffin
and all that's here is a pillow.
- Hey Jimmy, I don't know
if I like this new angle.
All we can see is your feet
and it kind of grosses me out.
- And we can see a couple of pee bottles.
- You don't think that's a great video,
just feet n' pee?
- We miss other side Jimmy.
- So what you're telling
me is you want me to go
to the other side, 'cause you missed me?
(groans) I did it.
When I tried to turn around
it was like very narrow on the other end
so it was a lot harder.
I almost started panicking,
but we made it.
- Jimmy, Jimmy!
We have to tell you
something really important
before we leave.
- Tell me.
(Karl laughing)
- Did he just leave without telling me?
- Yo Jimmy, I just wanna let you know
all of the monitoring equipment
is now officially inside of this truck
because it's about to start raining
and also a tornado is coming.
- Wait, a tornado is coming?
- Yeah, but you should
probably be safe down there,
to be honest.
- I don't know if anyone's
ever researched this,
but can you Google
at being buried alive
during a tornado is safe?
- We're Googling it right now.
Hot Russian singles in our area.
- Hey!
- I feel like you need
a little bit more help
to make sure that you
stay the entire 50 hours.
So we're just gonna
remind you of one thing.
(taser clicking)
- Wait guys, stop, stop. I feel it.
Stop. Stop.
- [Man] Huh?
(upbeat music)
- Hey Jimmy, listen here.
- What Karl?
- You've officially made
it underground 24 hours.
- Wait, really?
- So how do you feel
after being in underground for 24 hours?
- My back hurts.
Starting to feel claustrophobic.
Bored outta my mind.
I smell pretty bad.
I also smell the urine.
I ate all my beef jerky, vanilla wafers.
I don't feel too good.
- This is all the controls
for the lighting inside of it.
(slow bouncy music)
- What the heck?
You guys can change the
color of these things?
Oh, they're off.
Hey, turn 'em back on.
- Chandler, turn it back on.
Oh!
- [Jimmy] Well, that's not even funny.
- I don't know how to do it!
- This one's kind of cool,
can we keep this?
No. Oh yeah, there we go, pink's better.
Just vibing in my coffin.
(upbeat music)
- Hi. While Jimmy's asleep,
we're gonna tunnel down to him.
- Why are you whispering?
He's like six feet below us.
- Oh yeah. I guess that's a good point.
(excavator rattling)
Yeah. Look at that!
(Karl and Chris screaming)
- We're gonna find Jimmy no time.
Hey, let's keep digging
during this time-lapse.
(upbeat music)
Chris, how on earth can we not find Jimmy?
Look at this hole.
It's almost bigger than
the one we put him in.
- Yeah, it is.
It's actually bigger than
the one we put him in.
- [Jimmy] Hey Karl.
- Hey, what's up?
- I know you're trying to dig to me.
I can literally hear you guys.
- You hear us through the walkie-talkie.
- No, I literally hear you to my right.
- To you're right...
You'd say what degree
angle from the right?
- I'd say go to your
left and you'll be there.
I completely made that up.
I have no idea where they are (laughs).
- [Chris] That feels like
I'm hitting something.
- [Karl] You hear that?
(palm thumping)
- [Karl] Is it actually him?
- [Chris] Yeah. Yeah.
We found Jimmy!
(Chris and Karl laughs)
- How long did it take
you to dig that hole?
- [Chris] About an hour. One hour.
- Why?
- [Chris] I miss seeing you.
- Leave it to my weird friends
to dig a giant tunnel down to my coffin
so they can say hi to me.
All right.
So why did you guys dig this hole?
What's the point?
- We're gonna send you a message.
- All right.
I mean, you just sent it,
why'd you have to dig a hole?
- Totally not because we missed you
and wanted to see you again.
It's 'cause we wanted to do this.
(walkie-talkie beeping)
- Oh shoot.
I didn't even see.
Did you see that?
They dug that hole to put
penis on the side of my coffin.
Is there anything else or was that it?
- What do you mean is that it?
- Is that all you're doing
with the giant hole you dug?
- Yeah.
- What do you guys like 12?
- Yeah.
(upbeat music)
- Holy cow. It's filled
and there's a ton of stuff.
- Power of editing, baby!
It's crazy that Jimmy's just
right underneath us right now.
And I'm about the light of fire
on top of him.
- Just a bunch of dudes hanging out.
It's me, we got Chris.
Jimmy's right.
In about 20 hours, we're gonna
be able to use this again
and get him outta there.
- I think we're just gonna
camp over Jimmy's body.
We'll see you in the morning.
- All right, gamers.
My back and side hurt.
(yawns) I'm really tired.
I'll see you guys tomorrow.
It's literally 2 PM
and Karl and Chris are still asleep.
Just all alone at the burial site.
My friends don't even
care enough to visit me.
Only Nolan would come to my grave.
- It's like a ghost town around here.
They just left you here in your grave.
- Well, at least they slept well.
- Jimmy, I got a question for you.
Have you pooped?
- I have to poop really bad,
but I've decided just to hold it.
I have less than 10 hours left
and I'm not pooping in this coffin.
I literally rather be tased.
- You tell me you've held
your poop for 40 hours.
That's kind of a feat.
- Thank you.
I'm the opposite of Chandler.
- So look, it rained.
The tents are destroyed.
Of course we didn't sleep out here
but Jimmy still spent it underground.
- Hey.
(both chuckling)
He slept vertically
and I slept in my car sitting straight up.
Who's the real winner here?
- I'm bored.
So I'm gonna give one of you
that hits the subscribe button
in the next seven days, $10,000.
If you are subscribed, don't
unsubscribe and resubscribe.
That does nothing.
Just like go grab your
mom's account or something.
Mom's like our videos.
Chris!
- What?
- I want to get out.
I'm tired of being in here.
Just tase me.
- Oh wait, really? Actually?
- No idiot!
Why would I get out with three hours left?
What am I stupid?
The 50 hours I'm spending in
this coffin feels like a week.
I'm starting to get used
to being surrounded by
thousands of pounds of dirt.
I just noticed the one video
where I don't wear this merch
is the video where the shirt
is just plastered in every shot.
Blur this, put
shopmrbeast.com on top of it.
Now go to shopmrbeast.com
and buy something.
Thank you.
Hello? Is that you I hear digging, Karl?
- Yeah man, we're digging right now.
- No you're not.
That was sarcastic.
- I'll actually start digging.
I'm sorry, I wasn't digging and now I am.
(walkie-talkie clattering)
(foot thudding)
(both laughs)
(upbeat music)
- Hey Jimmy.
- Yes, Chris?
- We've got a surprise for you.
- Tell me if you could
hear this, all right.
- What are you doing?
- Oh wait, I don't have a lighter.
Can you get a lighter?
(walkie-talkie crashing)
- I got you.
- I'm gonna...
- Is this good for a lighter?
- Yeah, that'll...
(Karl laughing)
(fireworks booming)
- Are you sledge hammering the ground?
- [Chris] Yeah!
Whoa!
- Oh, it's firework.
- [Chris] The outside
world is crazy, Jimmy!
- Celebrating one hour left!
- Whoa!
- Could you smell the smoke down there?
- I actually can.
- We think it got in your
ventilation system, sorry.
(both laughs)
- Wait. Really?
- Yeah, we're probably not
gonna fire off anymore though.
Don't worry.
- [Jimmy] Based on how you said that
I'm assuming you have one
more and it's really big.
Thanks for letting me
know what you're doing.
- [Karl] Oh shoot.
- [Chris] Oh.
- It's like, there's an
earthquake happening.
(Karl laughing)
Hey, film it, I wanna watch it.
Oh wait, we're probably filming
it for the video. Nevermind.
I have three minutes and
then I can leave this box.
It's bringing tears to my eyes.
I'm so happy.
3, 2, 1.
It has officially been
50 hours buried alive.
It's been 50 hours, get me outta here!
- We're doing it.
My entire coffin's literally vibrating
every time he hits the ground.
- I'm sure it won't happen again.
(excavator rattling)
- It happened again.
(upbeat music)
The challenge ended 10 minutes ago.
They're still digging me up.
Hurry up.
- [Chris] Love you.
- Oh, I see a shovel.
I see a shovel.
- [Chris] Jimmy!
- Oh, there it is. There it is.
(Chris huffing)
I haven't seen the outside in so long.
Oh my gosh.
I'm so happy right now, I'm crying.
Oh my gosh.
- [Chris] Jimmy!
- Hi.
- Hey.
- There he is.
- Get me outta here.
- [Karl] Oh my God it's hot in there.
(Chandler and Chris groaning)
- [Chris] Oh my God,
Look at the pee bottles.
- [Chandler] You actually smell.
- It's almost like we
don't fake challenges.
We do 'em.
- [Chris] Oh my God.
You need to burn those clothes.
- That was stupid.
I have a massive headache
and I'm starving.
Goodbye.
(all laughs)
Get that camera outta my face.

Hey, how's it going?
I'm curious, if you would

Like, I have got bills to pay.

Would you be mad if she quit,

I'm your favorite employee!

- [Jimmy] I'm sorry.
- No, you're fine.
It's just God's way of working things out.
Like, this is such a blessing.
- Now we're on a football
field with two ex quarterbacks.
Now can you throw that football to him?
(whizzing sound)
You guys just made $1.
- [Crowd Sound Effect] Wow.
- You just made another dollar.
Every time you throw the
football back and forth,
you guys get a dollar.
Now here's the thing,
if one of you drop it or
it touches the ground,
you lose all your money.
(losing buzzer)
They literally have all day
to make as much money as they want.
We're gonna go to the next bit.
This is an $800,000 mansion
and this is the key to the front door.
Play dramatic music.
(dramatic music)
(keys rattling)
- That felt empowering.
- I feel like a man now.
- Now.
- Nolan, if you pick the correct
key out of this fishbowl,
that unlocks this door, you
get to keep this mansion.
Pick a key.
- Nolan wait!
Good luck.
- Oh, he's dumping the keys out.
- This could be an $800,000 decision.
- Nolan, you're taking forever.
Pick a key
- All right!
- Four.
Three.
Two.
One.
- Oh, that was a bad decision.
- If this key unlocks the
house, he gets a mansion.
Oh, thank God.
- It's way too big!
(all yelling)
Screw this game!
- We are now at an airport
and this is a pilot.
- I fly planes.
- And I want you to
take this piece of paper
and make a paper airplane.
And if it makes it past
this line, he gets,
$1,000.
5,000.
10,000.
And if it makes it all the
way past this line, $20,000.
If there was anyone who knew how to make
a perfect paper airplane,
it would be Wayne.
- That would be me.
- Do you think you're
gonna win the 20 grand?
- I'm gonna give it my best shot.
- $20,000 is on the line.
(dramatic music)
- [Jimmy] Precision.
Oh, huh?
- [Wayne] Hey!
- [Jimmy] That's not bad!
Wait a minute, Chris.
It only halfway made it.
- This is the halfway
point of the airplane.
- Uh-huh.
(exaggerated scraping)
- Oh, alright.
- You just won $10,000 in cash.
- I'll take it, I'll take it.
(Jimmy laughing)
- Wayne, can we just throw
this money in your plane?
- Yes, sir.
Put it right back here.
(register ching)
(register ching)
(door slam)
- Now that the money's in your plane,
the only reasonable thing
to do is fly off, right?
(airplane engine roaring)
- [Jimmy] Holy cow, whoo-hoo.
(upbeat music)
All right, let's go give away more money.
Now we're on the side of the road
(tire hissing)
and we have a flat tire.
And whoever helps us change
this flat tire first,
gets the car.
- Hey, we got a flat tire!
Hey, What a jerk!
(upbeat music)
- [Chris] Yes, let's go, we got somebody.
We don't know how to change a tire.
- We've literally been
on the side of the road
for over an hour just waiting
for someone to help us.
- [Brian] Are you serious?
This happened to me
like many years ago, and
I'm passing it forward.
- I really like this guy.
He said his car was falling apart.
He's being very helpful.
Very kind.
This is a perfect guy.
- Brian, thank you so much for
helping us change this tire.
Do you see that camera over there?
- Oh yeah.
We're actually a YouTube channel
with 50 million subscribers.
And since you helped us change the tire
on this car, it's now yours.
- What?
- Tereq, come over here.
Well, after the car, don't get ran over.
Basically we purposely popped that tire
and waited for over an hour to
have someone come help fix it.
Since you were the one
who helped us fix it.
Here's the key to your brand new car.
Yeah. -
- Are you kidding me?
- That's what you get for helping us, man.
We appreciate it -
- Oh my God.
- I'm just glad it went
to someone who actually,
you know, could use the help.
- I, no words.
- This right here is David.
He's a professional golf player.
Dave, if you can hit a hole in one.
I will give you $1 million today.
- I think I can do it
- Do you actually?
How many times have you hit on this?
- Too many to count.
- [Chandler] You ever hit a hole in one?
- No, but I don't wanna
talk about that right now.
(all laughing)
- [Dave] Karl's 151 yards away.
So the wind's coming off
a little left to right.
It is a little wet and damp.
60 degrees.
Which is a little bit cooler so the ball's
not gonna wanna fly as well.
- He's really calculating everything.
I'm starting to get nervous
for our million dollars.
(intense music)
- [Jimmy] Oh, dude t's like actually
going in that direction.
- [Dave] Oh my God.
- [Jimmy] Oh snap!
- [Dave] Oh
- [Jimmy] Oh my gosh, that is so close!
Oh my God.
Dude, look how close he is.
Oh my goodness.
You are less than one Chris
away from a million dollars.
Dave, you didn't win a million dollars,
but if you can hit it
in on this next stroke,
I'll give you 10 grand.
(all groaning)
- [Dave] Get it in there.
(all cheering)
- Thank you so much guys
for this opportunity.
It's unbelievable.
- Yeah
- That's the best way to put it.
- And speaking of winning 10 grand,
I wonder how the football
players are doing.
- Gentlemen!
What is up? Dude it's almost dark out.
- Yeah, it's getting rough out here.
- This is how many times they've thrown it
back and forth so far.
- [Karl] Whoa!
- Look at how full this case is getting
of money that they've made.
I have one challenge before we go.
If you go 10 yards back and do one throw,
I'll add $5,000 to your total.
This is a $5,000 throw.
Actually this is more, this is 5,000
plus all the money you've made
because if he drops it, they're done.
- You ready?
- [Griff] Yep.
- Oh boy, I'm nervous.
He threw it.
(intense music)
(all celebrating)
- That was a little
scary, I'm not gonna lie.
- [Jimmy] Oh man.
This trash bag has $5,000 in it.
Our boy Chandler here is hungry.
Chandler's gonna order a
pizza from Papa John's.
Chris is gonna order a pizza from Domino's
and Karl's gonna order
a pizza from Pizza Hut.
Whichever pizza is delivered first,
we're gonna tip
that pizza delivery driver, $10,000.
Whoever picks that driver
that arrives first,
we're gonna give your mom $10,000.
- Oh yay, my mom!
- Gentlemen, the weather
outside's very nice,
And order your pizzas!
- Oh my God, I'm so good at this.
It'll be for delivery.
- I don't want anything.
It'll be for delivery.
Pick up, I meant pick not delivery.
- It's delivery.
- I want a pizza.
- [Pizza Hut Employee] You're not looking
for anything specific?
- Nope.
- It's a rush order if you can.
Tell the driver that.
- Thank you.
Let's go! 25 minutes and counting.
- This is for delivery.
(Karl screams)
(smack)
(laughing)
- Why do you guys do this?
Stop it. It's for delivery and the app -
(Karl screams)
I can't deal with this!
I'm going to the Dominoes app!
Create new order.
Delivery.
No tomato sauce, no cheese.
Just bread, bread pizza!
It said, ""Hold up, this
pizza doesn't look right.
(all laughing)
- [Domino's Employee]
We're just wondering if,
we have an order from you.
That's small hand-tossed pizza
with no sauce and no cheese?
And we're just calling
to confirm that you just
want a slab of dough.
- Bread pizza, yes.
- Ah, Ah, Ah
- This is my local Dominoes
tied to my account.
I'm not gonna be able to get
Dominoes anymore after this.
- Omar just texted me,
he's nine minutes away.
- What?
- I was wondering about
the status of a delivery?
I'm very hungry.
- {Papa John's Employee] My driver's
on the way to you, Sweetie
- Awesome. Thank you.
- You can tell him
nevermind. I don't want it.
- I love you.
- ♪ Omar, Omar. ♪
Three minutes Omar's
three minutes away, move.
- Hey Jimmy -
- Omar has entered
our neighborhood and we'll arrive shortly!
- Shortly, but not short enough!
- Is your guy here?
- I don't know.
- Omar's pulling up, Baby!
- No thanks, no thanks.
- Hey Omar!
- [Omar] Chris!
- What's up?
- [Omar] Mr. Beast!
- What? -
- What's up?
- Come on, come on in -
- Come in Omar -
- [Omar] I love you guys' videos.
- [Jimmy] Oh perfect!
Well, guess what?
We ordered a pizza from Papa
John, Pizza Hut and Domino's.
At the same time.-
- Yes! -
Since you were the first
one to deliver the pizza.
Here's $10,000 in cash.
- Get outta here!
- Let's go bread pizza!
- [Omar] Oh yeah!
- [Chris] Bread pizza!
- Oh my God thank you guys so much.
- [Jimmy] You're so welcome.
- Oh man.
How's your pizza?
- Let's try it out.
(loud crunching)
(all laughing)
- Pizza Hut's here.
- [Jimmy] Oh your pizza.
(Karl laughing)
- Hi. Thank you so much.
- Hey! -
- Hi -
I'm from Domino's.
I'm actually gonna share my tip with you.
A hundred dollars.
- [Pizza Hut Employee]
Oh my God, seriously?
- That's yours.
- Oh, thank you so much.
- You just can't make this stuff up.
Chandler's driver still isn't here.
Your luck is so bad.
People think I script the videos.
- This guy Omar. He just won you $10,000.
- [Chris's Mom] Thanks
for the $10,000, Omar.
- [Omar] No -
- Thanks, Jimmy.
- Thank you! -
- We love you, Mom. Bye!
- This next bit is a fun one.
And this is Chad.
A professional soccer player.
- Hey, what's up guys?
- Word on the street
is you're really good.
So if you kicked that ball in that goal
I'll give you a thousand dollars.
- [Chris] Yeah!
- Chris!
- [Chris] Yes.
- Stand in the goal.
Chad, do you wanna risk
your $1,000 for $5,000?
But this time Chris is the goalie.
- I would do it.
Yes. Risk it. Yes.
- Yes, of course.
- $5,000.
Does he do it?
Why didn't you stop the ball?
- I like spending your
money, it's what I do.
- Karl, go get in the goal.
Do you wanna do double or nothing?
- Let's let's do it, man.
Let's do double or nothing -
- You're gonna risk it,
for the biscuit?
$12,000 on the line and he's off.
- Aw! -
- No!
- [Chris] Wow. Karl you
hate Chad or something?
- I couldn't dodge that if I wanted to!
- You just -
- I'm so sorry.
It's not my fault.
- Play the replay.
I don't see anyone else
it ricochet off of.
I'm not really good at stuff like this.
I'm gonna go check on
the football players.
I love you, man.
What is up gentlemen?
This is how much money
they've made so far.
I feel like we should end it in a fun way.
I love how serious they are.
It's like, I'm not even here.
Are you guys interested
in doing a little bit of
double or nothing?
- No.
- No? You don't even know what it is yet.
This is $17,000.
If you do one 30 yard pass,
then you can each
walk away with 17 grand.
Just your stereotypical touchdown pass.
One pass. 30 yards to here.
and he catches it, you both
walk away with 17 grand.
You know what?
I'll up it.
You both walk away with 20
grand and can go to bed.
- What do you think Griff?
- I mean I'm up for it if
you think you can do it.
- You, you say yes or no.
- Yes!
(all cheering)
- [Jimmy] All right!
Moment of truth.
Can he make this touchdown pass?
This is the most important
touchdown of your career.
(intense music)
(all cheering)
So you two just won $40,000.
What do you have to say?
- I'm shaking, I can't believe it.
- I'm done gambling after that.
(all laughing)"
vJH28ICkCdU,"- I just bought this house
and I'm literally selling it for $1.
That truck that just drove by
could have pulled in with
$1 and bought this house.
And just so you guys know,
this house isn't cheap.
It's actually pretty nice.
- That car missed a house.
That car missed a house.
That, ooh, that's nice car.
It missed a house.
(upbeat music)
- Clearly this sign isn't
working so we got a bigger one.
- Get that one outta here.
(upbeat music)
- We got someone.
We got someone.
We did it.
- He's in the driveway.
Hey, this house right here
is for sale for just $1.
Are you interested in purchasing it?
- What's the catch?
- There is no catch.
- No, there's gotta be a catch.
- This is the first bedroom.
What are your thoughts on it?
- It's alright.
- It's alright? Tough crowd.
This guy was so skeptical
that I literally had to
show him some of our
videos just to prove to him
we weren't scamming him.
- 54 million?
That's that's some real legit stuff there.
- I laid in this.
I tested it out.
It's completely great.
Fixed the bed after, as you
can see, I did a great job.
- Looks like there's a
dead body in the bed still.
- Listen, listen...
- Out back, it gets even cooler.
Follow us.
You're probably thinking,
""This just looks like
an ordinary shed.""
But if you come inside,
a fully fledged gym.
- Wow man.
Get outta here.
I'll give you $2 for this.
- We're not done.
Follow me.
And if you go inside here.
- Oh man.
- You have your very own gaming room.
- Oh yeah.
- Look at this.
- Come on, man.
Let's do this paperwork.
You ain't gotta show me anything else.
- If you wouldn't mind putting
your dollar in the briefcase.
- Thank you.
- You paid the deposit.
Here's the paperwork.
Congrats on your brand new home.
- This is it.
Can't beat it.
Can't beat it.
Can't believe I just bought
a house for a dollar guys.
- This is the second house.
- No I'm Karl.
- And the cool thing about
this house is it's actually
two separate houses combined into one.
- Get away.
- And instead of using this stupid sign,
I bought a billboard.
Houses for sale as high
as $1, nothing more.
And that billboard is
on a really busy street.
- There's gonna be a lot of people here.
- Oh, they just pulled into the driveway.
They must have saw the
billboard. Let's mask up.
Go, go, go, go, go.
- How are y'all doing?
You guys more of a left
or right kind of house.
- I like a right.
Yeah. That's good.
- Okay, good, because that's
the one we were gonna offer.
- I take it you saw the billboard?
Have you ever seen the channel Mr. Beast?
- Yeah. Yeah. I subscribe
to it on Snapchat.
- Oh, Snapchat?
You've only seen us on Snapchat.
- Yep.
- All right. Well, I guess
we're a Snapchat channel now.
You know, it's like the billboard said,
the house is a dollar.
Do you want me to show you around?
- Yeah, that'd be awesome dude.
- Okay. Let's do it.
- All right, come on in
guys. This is the place.
- This is the living room.
Over here's your stereotypical kitchen.
Never seen a washer and
dryer in the kitchen
but it's how the house came.
But follow me upstairs.
- And this is where your
Nerf guns go, apparently.
I don't know if you guys need Nerf guns?
- The master bedroom.
It's pretty big.
Ignore the Ghillie suit.
[enemy spotted]
- So the first room is the game room.
You've got a PS Five,
brand new gaming computer,
and then here's your retro gaming corner.
- Oh my God.
It's so beautiful. I think
I might just live in here.
- And the best part of the house.
No, I want you to pull it.
- This is gonna be the most exciting part
of the entire house.
- A lifetime supply of toilet paper.
- It's a lifetime supply of toilet paper.
- Toilet paper aside,
we actually did have
a really cool surprise
waiting for them.
- Holy
- That's awesome, dude.
- Yeah. So this also comes with it.
- Is it like full?
- Yeah there's money.
- I kind of wanna dive into it.
- And while they were
signing the paperwork
more cars kept showing up
and we had to thin people off
by giving them bags of money.
Oh, hey!
The houses were already
sold, but that's why
we brought these bags of money.
Here you go.
Do you have any more?
- You only gave me three.
- Well, it looks like
your kids just got rich.
- That's fine!
All right.
Do people just bring their entire family
to random addresses on billboards?
- You guys shouldn't
trust things so easily.
- I just bought a house for
a dollar. Is this real life?
- I've been subscribed for a while now.
And I don't even know
what to say right now.
Like I'm in shock.
- Here is your key.
Here's the key to your guys' house.
You guys are now neighbors.
And now we're back at the fourth house.
And instead of selling
this house for a dollar,
we're gonna be giving
it to someone in need.
- We have a friend that's
been in and outta the hospital
and I think this would
be just great for her.
- I'm glad we could help her.
So, blur this.
Todd, here's my credit card.
Buy whatever furniture you think
your friend would like in this house.
I don't care what it costs.
If you think your friend
would like it, buy it.
This is the next house
and we're gonna do something different.
- What are we doing?
- I want Tareq to give his camera to Karl
and then Brady give your camera to Chris.
Now we have the goofy goobers filming
and we have our cameramen here.
- Hey
- I don't care who it is,
whoever puts a dollar in pennies
in this briefcase first gets the house.
- Oh, hey, let's go.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- While we're talking, Tareq
is getting a head start.
- No, no, no, Tareq no.
- I need to go to a heavily populated area
that has a lot of people so
I can ask 'em for pennies
and see if they can give me any.
- Yeah, this whole being a camera person
thing's kind of easy.
- You kinda into it?
- Yeah. I don't get why you're bad at it.
- I mean, it's not... oh.
- Chris, you gotta run.
- I don't like to run.
How about a mom jog?
- What if I give you a
dollar for all your change?
Thank you so much.
Appreciate it.
Five pennies.
We're 5 cents in. Let's
go, let's go, let's go.
- That's 1/20th!
- All right.
Just go to a checkout.
I feel like if I wait
in line, I'm gonna lose.
If I give you 20 bucks,
will you give all the
pennies that you have?
You don't have any pennies?
- No pennies.
- Meanwhile, Todd and his
wife were just going ham
buying stuff for the final house.
- I like this couch over here.
- I'll tell you this one is good.
- How much is this whole set right here?
- $5,000 for all of it. Would you take it?
- Where are we gonna put all this?
- Didn't they get a couch?
- Six of these?
Are you sure?
- I think this is enough from this store.
- Yeah.
- I sure hope Jimmy's card works.
- There they are.
They're they're coming in here.
- Oh, he's getting pennies.
He's getting pennies.
- We already got this
spot, get outta here.
Do you have a hundred pennies?
- You can do that?
I really didn't think you
would be able to do that.
- If I give you 20 bucks,
will you give me all the
pennies that you have?
- Why would he ask a complete stranger?
What are the odds of them
carrying a hundred pennies?
- Thank you so much.
- You just helped him win a house.
- I just need pennies.
Yes, thank you so much.
- Don't get hit by a car,
that would be really bad.
But it wouldn't be funny though.
- Oh my God that's so many
pennies. If I give you $20,
will you gimme all the
pennies that you have?
Will you guys gimme all
the pennies that you have?
Pennies.
I need pennies.
Pennies. You think this guy has pennies?
Pennies.
Penny.
All the pennies.
- You think you have enough pennies?
- I think so.
- Oh my gosh, dude. I
think this is my house.
Jimmy, Jimmy.
- What's up?
- I got it.
- Let me see.
Let's actually confirm
there's pennies in here.
(Mario music)
99, 100.
- Yes! Yes! Woo!
- Congratulations Brady.
You just won a brand new house.
Welcome back Tareq.
- Hello.
- I'm gonna show Brady
around his new house
and if you don't mind, could you film us?
- Oh, gladly. Oh, gladly.
- Now, if you go through
the bathroom, follow me.
This is your master
bedroom and it is huge.
- Oh my gosh.
I cannot believe this.
Look at this, it comes with a fireplace.
Holy cow. Look at the
natural light in this.
Hey, there's Jeff.
That's our sound guy.
- Hey Jeff.
- Now Brady, you're probably wondering
what does this creepy door lead to?
There's stairs.
- There's stairs.
- Proceed up the stairs.
(gasp)
- No freaking way.
- Tareq you really lost this one, bro.
- Now Brady has his very
own movie theater room
to watch all the Disney movies he wants.
Because he looks like the kind of guy
who'd like Disney movies.
- What's wrong with that, huh?
Hmm?
- Hey look, I'm a cat, meow.
- Oh gosh.
(laughter)
(screaming)
Oh my God!
- Here's the key to the house.
(epic music)
Hope there was epic music.
Let's go see how much
damage Todd has done.
- Oh, I was gonna hop
backwards and be like
I'm gonna take a nap.
- No, we're just gonna
put that in instead.
(laughter)
When we left, this house was empty.
Let's see what happened.
Oh my gosh.
- Oh wow.
- Hey.
- Tell us what you bought.
- Seven or eight TVs.
- Six or seven more than
needed, but that's fine.
Wait, Chris, is that a grill?
Do people put grills inside their house?
- No, that's how you start a fire, Jimmy.
- Why is there so much coffee?
- She likes coffee.
This is my favorite
room in the whole house.
Look at this.
- Look at this shower.
- Look at this pool.
- I think we should invite her over.
She's gonna call Felicia
and tell her to come
over to be in a video.
Well, I don't know why I did
this. It's actually a video.
Felicia just pulled up
and will knock on the door any second now.
- Oh, hey Felicia, come on in.
- Todd spill the beans.
What have you been working on all day?
- This is your house.
Everything in here is yours.
- Wait a minute.
- I know, I know it's a lot to process,
but dead serious. 100%. I promise.
- I just don't even.
I don't.
I'm like, I don't know.
- Thank you?
- I don't even know what to do.
I know I keep saying the same thing,
but I just don't even know.
I don't even, I don't even believe it.
- Todd thought you wanted eight TVs,
so it comes with eight TVs.
(laughter)
- Hey yo, ma.
You deserve it.
- I don't, no, I don't deserve this.
- You've been through
a lot. You deserve it.
- What do I do?
Just show her the grill?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Show her the grill.
She's crying!
- Oh my gosh!
- So is Todd lying to me?
Do you actually like coffee?
- She loves coffee.
- You have a lifetime supply.
- Oh my gosh.
Y'all are nuts.
- The cool thing is there's more to go.
You wanna see back here?
My personal favorite part of
the house is the bathroom.
- No.
(screaming)
- I'm so glad you liked the house.
- I don't even know what to say.
I'm in shock.
- Don't have a heart attack
when I tell you this,
but we might have one more thing for you.
You can probably see it from here.
- Y'all done bought me a whole car?
- To go with your brand new
home is a brand new car.
I'm so glad you're so happy.
- I-
I'm so excited, I don't
even know what to say.

C680oxL__ck,"- [MrBeast] In this video
we are going to be eating
$100,000 golden ice cream.
- I'm blown away.
This is so good.
- $5,000 Mac and cheese.
- This Mac and cheese is magnificent.
- $30,000 Banana foster.
- Ooh, that's incredible.
- And so much more,
starting off with $100 ice
cream and working our way up.
This is $100 ice cream.
It's really good.
This cheese is $500.
- That's pretty good.
- Oh gosh. I'm excited.
Oh my God.
This is really good.
All right, we're going to the next course.
This is $1,000 chocolate.
As you can see they're
golden flakes on it.
Oh my God.
- Oh, wow.
- Oh.
- This is amazing.
- Oh.
- When you eat stuff
like this with gold on it
your body doesn't digest it.
You just poop out gold.
And with that knowledge, let's
go to the next restaurant.
We're about to eat $2,000 cake.
- Each plate is worth $2,000.
- Each plate?
- It's a white chocolate,
grape juice petit gateau,
raspberry coulis, and vanilla genoise.
In between the moose,
raspberry reduction sauce
and grape juice jelly.
- You could tell it's good
'cause of how many words
I didn't understand.
- I call dibs on firsties.
- Oh, come on.
- Oh my gosh.
- Oh that's so good.
- This is good.
(both laughs)
- Come on, that's just-
- That's just disrespectful.
- [Chris] Come on, that's a $2,000-
- No, it's so good.
Easily, the best dish so far.
- Now this might seem expensive
and it tastes really good.
But imagine what the $100,000
ice cream will taste like.
- I'm worried I'm not
gonna like food after it.
- We are now at the next restaurant.
- So it's a black skin chicken,
which is a very rare chicken.
Biscuits with foie gras.
White truffle mashed with red-eye gravy
made with coffee.
- Chandler here's some
$3,000 fried chicken.
If you're wondering who
this is, it's Michelle.
She's a random subscriber.
Now that we're starting to get into
the really expensive food,
we're gonna bring in random subscribers
and let you guys experience it with us.
And don't worry, they're all
quarantined and got tested.
We're safe.
- That is good.
- That is really good.
It tastes amazing, but that
color is really throwing me off.
- Smell the mashed potatoes.
- Oh my gosh.
- Yeah.
- No, I'm not eating that.
- I'm gonna take one for the team.
(playful music)
It's good.
- Oh, is it jelly and liver.
- It's so powerful.
It just lets you know it's
in your mouth instantly.
- Would you say it was worth it?
- I would say so, yeah.
- Perfect. Next restaurant.
We are now at the next restaurant.
This is a random subscriber, Daryl.
At this restaurant we're gonna be eating.
- Guayasamin Ecuadorian chocolate tart.
(trumpets playing)
- It's an Ecuadorian chocolate
that comes from ancient tree.
Each bar that's 50 grams
cost about 500 bucks.
- How scary is it to put
a dish together like that?
- Don't mess up the recipe.
(all laughs)
- Wait, what is that?
- My man just pulled up
an entire rainforest cafe.
- [Daryl] What the heck?
Nothing's gonna jump outta my meal, right?
- That is crazy.
- Hmm. Oh my God.
- That is really good.
- I love this.
- The caramel sauce. Mm.
- Genuinely, this is
one of the best desserts
I've ever tasted in my life.
Aren't you glad you subscribed.
- Yeah, I'm so glad I subscribe.
- Daryl, you have five seconds to say
whatever you want. Go!
- Like can subscribe.
And it's great to eat a $4,000-
- All right next restaurant.
(all laughs)
All right.
We rented this entire restaurant.
We're being safe.
If anyone tries to come and eat here,
we have someone waiting at the door
giving them $1,000.
Play the clip of them getting money.
This next dish is $5,000 Mac and cheese.
(all gasping)
- Ooh.
- Oh my gosh.
I know later in the video we're
eating $100,000 ice cream,
but this is probably gonna taste better.
- I'm excited.
- Can you tell us about
this Mac and cheese?
- [Chef] I sent someone to Norway
to get a live Norwegian red king crab.
We sent someone all the way to Italy
to get $4,000 worth of
fancy mushroom mushrooms.
- Mushrooms?
- And I've got a little something
for Chandler in the back.
- Oh really?
- Yes.
It's an extra plain macaroni and cheese.
- [All] Ooh.
- Okay.
- Oh, and it's in a PUBG toy.
- Tareq, get close up of that.
Look at it drippin'.
- Oh, Tareq.
- It's drippin'.
I say we all wait and take a
bite at the exact same time.
- Hold on, let me get a scoop.
(pan sizzling)
Ah.
- Karl, we're trying to taste test.
- No, this mac and cheese is magnificent.
- Oh my gosh.
This is amazing.
- Yeah. This compared to
the like all black chicken.
- Oh my God.
- This is good.
- I'm having an intimate moment.
- Oh, this is a crab.
I forgot there is crab in there.
- Dude, no way.
- Tareq, can you film me?
And by film me, I mean
switch seats with me.
Tareq, you get experience
the $5,000 Mac and cheese.
- Okay
- Dude, do you need a hug?
I'm pissed at how good it is.
- I'm mad.
- Well guys, how was it?
- This was amazing.
Good job.
- [Chef] Thank you so much guys.
- Applauding you because you
made something expensive,
that still tasted good.
- Yes!
- Which surprisingly is very hard.
Pinky touch.
- Nyeow.
Teleport.
For this next dish.
We have another subscriber, Monica.
- Hi.
- Chris is wearing the
sexy Shop MrBeast merch.
And Karl is just wearing a Dream merch.
Just blur it.
(Monica laughs)
Blur it and put Shop MrBeast text over it.
(Karl laughs)
- Oh, its not blurred. Its not blurred.
Oh, now it's blurred again.
We are about to eat $7,000 puff pastry.
Basically. It's a wheel of cheese
with 40 year old sauce on it.
- Brie is like one of my
favorite all time cheeses ever.
- You have favorite cheeses?
- Yeah.
- My favorite cheese is Mac N'.
- So that's cheese?
- [Chef] Baked in puff pastry, yeah.
- [MrBeast] Oh, it's triple C thick.
- It's like stuck together. It's so thick.
- [Chris] The sauce smells really good.
You should try it just
for the sauce alone.
- This doesn't look like poor
people brie that I'm used to.
- I don't like the smell of it.
- You can tell you're
regretting your decisions.
- I don't like cheese.
All right. We dig it in?
- If I have to.
(Monica chuckles)
- I'm scared of cheese.
I'm scared of cheese.
(Monica laughs)
- It really tastes.
- It tastes like cheese.
It just tastes like a block of cheese.
- Very cheesy. It's an acquired taste.
- Acquired taste is a
way of saying it sucks.
I'm not eating it.
- Nothing could have prepared me
for the explosion of old cheese taste.
- I know.
Just gotta go through a little
bit of pain on our way up.
- [Chris] We gotta get through the cheese
to get to the ice cream.
- This next meal is gonna cost $9,000
but not because of the food.
In this video where we gave people
who lost their job through the coronavirus
a bunch of money, we donated it to a chef.
And now we're currently at his restaurant,
and we're gonna order
the most expensive thing
on the menu and tip him $8,000.
It's been a while.
- It's been a while. How are you?
Because of you, I was
able to like take care
of my hospital bills,
like continue cooking.
That really means a lot to me.
So thank you very much.
- That so heartwarming.
Oh my goodness.
So this right here is $1,000.
- We have a Hamon-stuffed Cornish hen.
It is a Dutch chocolate.
- This stuff on top?
- Absolutely.
The mashed potatoes is where you'll find
a little bit of truffle
but like a lot of garlic
and seasoning and whatnot.
- Say no more.
- Garlic?
- [Chef] Yeah.
- Mashed potatoes.
- Those are good.
- Those are very good.
It doesn't overpower it.
- Yeah. A lot of this expensive stuff
they just kinda like smear truffles on it.
This is how you're
supposed to use truffles.
I really wanna try this chocolate chicken.
- Chocolate chicken.
- That's a weird sentence.
- I got a big glob of
that sauce in my mouth
and it's good, but it's strong.
(MrBeast grunts)
- What are you doing?
- That is so weird.
- There's a lot going on in your mouth.
- It shouldn't work. Why does it work?
- Since you're generous
enough to make us this meal,
we brought you a $10,000 tip.
- So you like the chicken?
- I did.
(both laughs)
We're gonna finish eating here.
And starting now, things get serious.
No more games.
- Only food.
- It is now time for the $30,000 meal.
Me and the boys had to get all dressed up.
If the suits weren't enough,
we brought another subscriber.
And we forgot to tell them to wear a suit.
Tell us about the banana foster
- It's made with a special apple sauce.
We have some crystallized honeycomb.
We have honey meringue infused
in a oolong tea from 1996.
- That's that's when I was born.
- We're obviously gonna flambe it for you
right here on the table.
So we're gonna have a nice fireworks.
- Oh really?
- Ooh.
- [Chef] Of course.
- Aren't you glad you subscribed?
- Oh, I am stoked that I subscribed.
I'm excited.
- So right here we have a-
- Hot Pocket.
- A vanilla panna cotta.
- [Chris] Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle.
Yo, he brought fire.
- Oh my goodness.
That's probably the coolest
thing we've seen so far today.
- Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.
Oh, that's good.
- Wow.
Ooh that's incredible.
- That's fantastic. I'm in love.
- The middle jiggly thing
carries the whole thing.
- I will trade anything
in this banana foster
for these brownies, these are insane.
- What are these little balls?
- Those are hazel nuts.
- Oh, I thought they were meringues.
After this, we are eating a $50,000 steak
and then $100,000 golden ice cream.
The receipt is in a box.
- Ooh.
- And just so you have
proof that says $30,000
and then we left a $5,000 tip.
I'm gonna go pay the $36,000 bill.
I'll see at the next restaurant.
This is our final restaurant.
We are about to eat $50,000 steaks
and the $100,000 ice cream.
And you know the deal, we
brought a random subscriber in.
What's up, William.
- Hello, Jimmy.
- Before we eat the $100,000 ice cream,
we want your $50,000 golden steak.
So can you just tell us about that?
- Absolutely. So our steak
has been aged for four months.
We smoked it for about 15 hours.
We put it in a blanket of gold,
just to keep it warm and amazing.
We think it might be the most
expensive beef in the world.
- It's like gold tin foil wrapped on it.
(menacing music)
- It's menacing.
- Oh my God.
- Oh my God.
- [Chris] That is beautiful.
- [Karl] It's like the geographic channel.
- All right.
- [William] What is a truffle?
What is a truffle?
- Ill skip with the truffle.
- I'll have a little bit,
a ton of white truffles so far.
- I could imagine.
- Just like, yeah, like two grazes,
there we go, okay.
- The most expensive salt in the world.
- Oh my God. You did it like that guy.
- On the count of five take a bite.
One, two, five.
- Oh.
(steak thuds)
- Oh my God.
- Oh my goodness. What?
This is so rich tasting,
if that's a way to say it.
- I mean, yeah.
- Truffles not bad on it.
This is good truffle.
- We have a sauce that costs $19,000.
Did you like it with-
- Oh my God, really?
- Yeah.
You sauce me up baby.
- Matsutake mushrooms
with black truffle juice.
- Oh my gosh.
It's like steak sauce,
but 500,000 times better.
More please.
- Wow.
- I am so glad I subscribe to MrBeast.
Best steak of my life.
- We also have some
caviar with potato cake.
- Oh. So it's like a baked
potato, but rich people.
It's a loaded baked potato.
They were right.
It's so good.
- Oh wow.
- Oh my gosh. I do like it.
- In this video, we brought
tons of subscribers in
to eat lots of expensive food.
And in the past we've
had subscribers compete
for cars, houses, even a million dollars.
If you're not already,
hit that subscribe button
there's no reason not to.
And guys, up next is what
I've been talking about
the entire video, $100,000 ice cream.
- Yes.
- Oh my God.
- Yes.
- As scary as this sounds,
we would like to try your
most expensive ice cream,
the $100,000 ice cream with
all the different sauces,
which I know get really expensive here.
(heavy metal music)
For the love of God.
What am I looking at?
- [Chef] Each one of those
ice cream balls that you see,
cost over $100 to make.
We've got chocolate from South America
made from chocolate bars
that cost $500 each.
Strawberries that are picked from Japan,
flown over last night,
first class, just for you.
- Wait from Japan?
- From Japan.
- [Chef] We topped those strawberries
in a bottle of 99 year old grape juice
that cost over $20,000.
- Oh my God.
Every time you put one of those
strawberries in your mouth
it's $75.
We have miniature candied peaches,
those are the little green parts.
Each one of those peaches cost $500.
- Geez.
- For a peach?
- Here, we have a wild huckleberry sauce.
Each one of these spoons
is gonna set you back about 50 bucks.
And with any sundae, you're
gonna need caramel sauce.
This one's gonna set
you back about $3,000.
- That look so good.
- Butterscotch made with some really,
really, really fancy 50
year old apple juice.
This my friends is $45,000.
- Oh my God.
- What?
- No way.
- You're dumping $45,000
on top of the ice cream.
- And there you have it guys,
a $100,000 ice cream sundae.
- Okay.
- I never thought I'd see it in person.
- I personally don't even
feel comfortable eating it.
So I brought in even more subscribers.
We have three random subscribers here,
two of my best friends.
Guys, enjoy the $100,000 ice cream.
(group chattering)
- I need one of these strawberries.
(group chattering)
- Wow.
(all screaming)
- Oh no!
- What are you doing?
- That's not me. (screams)
- He said each one of
those ice cream balls
were made with $500 chocolate bars.
- And I just dropped it on the table.
Oops.
- Oh my God.
- Oh my God.
- Wow.
- That's so.
- Oh my God. That is a delectable.
- That's amazing.
I can see a hundred thousand
dollars right there.
- Let's try the baby
peaches, they're so good.
(group chattering)
(all screaming)
- I'm blown away, this is so good.
- It's like the king of desserts.
- Honestly, I can't even
compare it to anything.
It's so crazy.
- They do look really good.
- Jimmy, nobody's gonna get mad at you.
- Nope. I don't want it.
- He's a man on his word.
- All the boys over there
seem to really be enjoying the ice cream
and having a good time.
My personal favorite videos to film
are the ones where we help other people.
But, sometimes we gotta
splice stuff like this in.
Videos like this, do
help grow my audience,
so when I do give away more money,
I have more money to give away.
If that makes sense.
Just wanted to give a little context,
I swear I'm not a snob.
- Jimmy, how is this my life?
Thank you.
- Are you happy you
ruined ice cream for me?
- 50,000 for the steak in its sauce,
and then 100,000 for that sundae.
So, $170,878.
Thank you for watching.

5Fg9oZk-5uA,"- I literally bought every
single item in five stores.
Starting with this one.
All right boys, fill up the carts.
I want everything in the store.
- Do these zebra pants
count as everything?
- If it's in the store we're buying it.
In this video right here,
we bought everything in a store
and you guys really liked the video.
So now we're doing it again.
But with five stores
- You really wanna buy
everything in the store?
- I'm being dead serious.
We want to buy every
single thing in your store
and we will pay the price.
- It's all for sale that's for sure.
(All laugh)
- All right.
- Do you need me help
you pack it or anything?
- Just put it all into carts.
Just start grabbing stuff,
we need to get all of it.
- If anybody knows how
to buy their own store
it's the people who work here.
- Okay, I got it.
- You want me to pull?
- Yes, pull, pull, pull.
- We're gonna be donating
all these jackets
to people in need.
So it's actually really good
that we got all these warm
puffy jackets for 'em,
'cause it's cold outside.
- Did you guys need things
to keep your face cozy?
- These jackets are $340 a piece.
I just grabbed like eight of 'em.
- What? They make jackets that expensive.
- Hey, it's for people in need. Yeah!
- Yeah.
- This is about seven
grand of beanies in here.
- $7,000 in beanies?
- Oh, beanies alone.
- We still have four more stores.
- Yeah we do!
- Whose idea was this?
- Literally yours.
- Fair enough.
- I'm headed to retirement.
- I'll see you on the golf course.
- I'm using my brain.
I don't know where I'm
supposed to go with this now.
- Jimmy said everything.
- Can we do this?
- I don't know.
- They're hand typing in
every single item we buy.
How about I make things easier?
Do you just know what
everything in the store's worth?
- Approximately what it is, yes.
Probably takes $75,000 for it.
- $85,000, then!
$85,000?
All right, $85,000.
Just put it all in the U-Haul.
We don't even have to scan it.
I wasn't joking when I said we would buy
every single item in this store.
And obviously I don't need hundreds
of shirts, jackets, and shoes.
So, we're gonna donate
it to The Salvation Army.
- All right.
- And as you can see,
this is a brand new Salvation Army store.
They don't even have
stuff on the shelves yet.
And yeah here's the time lapse
of us off loading everything.
One store out of five down.
Up next, we're gonna buy
everything in GameStop.
This is going to be fun.
I wanna buy everything in the store.
- I don't see a problem with it.
- I don't see a problem at all.
Carl, you're in charge of this wall.
- This one.
- Chris, you're in charge of this wall.
- All right.
- Nolan, you're in charge of this wall.
- Done.
- Chad, Chad, Chad, Chad.
In the last video you
threw a lot of things.
You were pretty destructive.
A lot of comments didn't like that.
Promise me you won't throw anything.
- I'm not, I'm not.
I'm not, I'm not.
- Okay, okay, okay.
Good, good, good.
Whew.
Am I allowed to buy these as well?
- 15 cents a pop, yeah.
- All right. I guess
we're buying the racks.
Now, when we say everything,
we mean everything.
- They made ""Far Cry 6""?
Did anyone play that?
- Sean, what's your strat here?
- Being careful and not
destroying anything.
- We got socks.
We got beanies, it's getting cold out.
- How many copies of
""Avengers"" on the PlayStation 4
does one store need?
This is probably more than
they actually sold in total.
- Yeah, because I count
more than just one there.
- I need another cart, this one's full!
- We have five shopping
carts full of video games.
I think we should start scanning.
- This is gonna take forever.
- How much do you think this will cost?
- A lot.
- A lot, yeah.
- While we're here, I'd like
to take this opportunity
to say if any of these games
that we're buying right now
would like to sponsor
us, I'll take your money.
- I either love all of them or
have no opinion on them yet.
- So far the total's up to like 30 grand
but thank God they have a clearance rack.
- Hey, could we pay full
price for this stuff?
- Shut up.
We cleared this wall.
We're clearing this wall.
We're making great progress.
This is insane.
This is literally over 1,000 video games.
As you can see the
entire GameStop is empty.
We literally bought every thing.
And now it's time for the
moment you've been waiting for.
He is currently pulling the receipt.
Oh my goodness.
- Hey, hey, we found the end.
- Well, if you didn't
believe me when I said
we bought everything, now you know.
I wanted to do something special
with the games we bought from this store.
So we decided to wrap everything.
And now we're at the Boys & Girls Club
which is a charity that
helps children in need.
And we're gonna unload the
thousands of wrapped up games
and stuff so they can have
the best Christmas ever.
This is a pro gamer move.
This one's really special to me.
I just genuinely hope
that these games really
make these kids day.
- For this next store,
we're gonna do something
a little different.
We're buying every car on this car lot.
- Again.
- Funny story, in this video right here
we bought every car in the lot.
So this is our second time doing this.
Let's see how they react.
- What's up Mike? It's been a while.
- Hey, it's Jimmy from MrBeast.
- I'm actually here to buy the lot again.
- Again?
- Again.
- Ah, my God.
- I'm sorry.
Okay, and there we go.
All right.
- Thank you.
- Let's do this.
We have the same banner from last time.
I never got rid of it.
I literally bought all these cars here
and I don't even know what I bought.
- Is this a ""Call Of Duty"" Hummer?
- Yes, indeed.
- What?
- I'm trying to find the keys.
- You're just giving this away?
- Boys you know what we gotta do.
Put $0 on all of them.
It is illegal to charge for a car here.
- I don't know if that's
how legality work,
- Hey guys, we have our first customer.
I don't care.
Kelly, you take one of them.
Chris, you take one of them.
- So what are you looking for in a car?
- Honestly anything.
- All right, let me go
get the keys real quick.
I'll be right back.
- Oh, I didn't know I was getting keys.
Okay, this is crazy.
That's it?
- Completely free.
- Oh my gosh, okay.
- I made a sale, Jimmy!
Yo, selling cars is easy.
Why doesn't everybody do this?
- This one?
- Yes, the black is perfect.
- Simple man, deal.
- Oh, this is awesome.
I can't believe this.
Came here to try to get a nicer car
for the family and stuff.
I can't believe it.
Thank you MrBeast.
- That went pretty well.
To celebrate, let's show them
what we've been working on.
The triple down.
- Hey.
- Hello? What kind of car do you want?
- My son, he's about to get his permit.
So I want something for him.
- Ooh. I don't know anything about cars,
but this looks cool.
Congratulations. It's all yours.
- For real?
- Yeah.
- My son is gonna be so happy!
- This is perfect, the perfect gift.
- There is so much going on.
Chandler's helping someone.
Nolan's helping someone.
Chris is helping someone.
Carl's helping someone.
What the heck?
- Congratulations then.
If you want it, it's completely yours.
How does that sound?
- For real?
- Yes, absolutely.
- I'm so happy. Thank y'all so much.
- Congratulations, you own a truck now.
- This is legal?
- Which one speaks to you the most?
- This one was speaking to me.
- Then that's the one.
All right, it's yours.
- Literally?
- Yeah. It's free.
- Like, free free?
- Yes.
- Yes.
- You like it?
- I love it.
- Okay, then it's completely yours.
- Y'all really made a dream come true.
And thank you guys so much.
- As you can see, we have
now given away every car
except for this last one.
And the problem with this last
car is it's actually a stick
and no one knows how to drive a stick.
Except one person I know.
You know how to drive a stick, don't you?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, Timmy!
- Yeah! Timmy!
- Timmy got a car!
- You're a good cameraman.
Here's a brand new car.
(cheering)
- Yeah.
- So Tim, because you know
how to wobble this thing
you just got a free car.
- Yeah!
- And with that car gone,
store number three is done.
Two more to go.
We're at the fourth store.
Yada, yada. You already
know what we're doing.
- We're buying everything.
- Just double checking,
you okay with me literally
buying everything in your store?
- Yeah.
- Here you guys go, here are some carts.
You know what to do.
I want everything in this store!
- Go go go, go go!
- Oh no.
- Oh God.
- All right, Carl. Pick up the golf balls.
- Look at how much stuff is in this store.
This is gonna be so expensive.
- I just assumed it was a fake call.
And then he actually showed up.
- This is how I lost an island,
'cause I couldn't make a corn hole shot.
(duck quacking)
- Some of these baseball bats are $500.
- Wait, what?
How is a baseball bat 450 bucks?
- Jimmy, can I keep this?
- Are you charity?
- Maybe. Okay, you're right.
All right, I'll donate it.
- We gotta get this outta here, right?
- We are gonna buy this.
- I got it.
- Whoa, slow down.
Slow down man!
- We called up a bunch of
local high school coaches
and we're gonna let them come
get equipment for their team.
Basically, we are buying
everything in this store.
Whatever you grab for
your teams you can keep,
so go grab whatever you want.
- They're coaches, all
they know is hustle.
- Could your kids use a javelin?
- I could definitely use a javelin.
- Your players are gonna be so happy.
What the heck?
- We've been needing new shoulder pads
for about 10 years now, so.
- Oh really.
- We have one of the lowest
poverty areas in the county
and some of our kids go
without equipment sometimes.
And this is gonna be a
tremendous game breaker for them.
Being able for y'all
to give back to the
community like you are.
I appreciate everything
that y'all done for it.
- Everybody's so blessed.
- It's definitely been a blessing
all across the community.
- Unbelievable. Look at all these things,
you kinda gotta step back and just kind of
thank God and thank him as well.
- It took so long, but the
store is finally empty.
And if you're wondering what the total is,
you wanna read it off to them?
- $85,000.
- 85 grand for this entire store.
So, here you go.
And we're gonna head to the next store.
And now we're gonna buy
the fifth and final store, Food Lion.
We've already conquered four stores.
- Ha!
- You didn't ha.
- Ha!
- I want everything.
- All right, let's go.
You start on the right,
I'll start on the left.
- I guess I'm gonna start
off with the ranch section.
I can't believe I'm about
to spend 10 grand on ranch.
- All we need to focus
on is macaroni right now.
There's so much of it.
- I feel like we got enough
chocolate, don't you think?
- Do we have all of it?
I'm sorry, do we have all of it?
- No no, there's a lot of chocolate.
- No, I'm sorry.
Maybe we have all of it then.
'Cause you just said we have enough.
- No, we don't have all the chocolate.
- We don't have all the chocolate.
- Okay, let's get the
rest of the chocolate.
Our first cart done.
Let's look at the damage.
- Not a lot.
- It looks like we weren't even here.
We gotta go faster.
- Faster.
- Get the beans, get the beans.
- Beans, beans, beans.
- We really haven't done anything.
- It's been three minutes.
We've got like three pieces of inventory
out of this entire aisle.
- Oh my God.
- All right. I got a cart full of ranch.
- You know, they call me ranch.
- Why?
- 'Cause I be dressing.
- Look how much other stuff there is.
I didn't even make a dent in my aisle.
- More mac, Sean, get it.
- How are we supposed to do this?
Look how long this is.
- This is gonna take years.
- I'm gonna make some
phone calls, we need help.
- Yeah, please.
- Howdy there.
Chris, go ahead and start
throwing your Mac and Cheese up.
- Oh yeah.
- Nolan, help me unload ranch.
All this is less than 1% of the store.
Food Lion called in extra
people to help us pack carts.
This is hilarious.
- Nolan, here's some ranch.
- No, I just got done with the ranch.
- We've been going for like an hour.
We haven't even cleared out a single aisle
and there's like 16 in the store.
I think we need them to
bring in more employees.
At the start of this video,
we bought everything in a clothing store.
Then we bought an entire
GameStop, a car lot,
and then an entire sports store.
And now we're buying an entire Food Lion.
- It never ends.
- So far, we've spent
over $30,000 on food.
This is ridiculous.
- This is a U-Haul full of food.
And you might think that's crazy
but we have another U-Haul full of food.
Which you're probably thinking is nuts.
Two U-Hauls full of food?
Well, what if I told you
we have a third U-Haul
- No!
- full of food?
- Not a third one!
- Can I have this holographic
dinosaur lunch box?
- If you clear off the
entire pudding shelf, yes.
- Let's do it.
- Taco.
- Load it faster.
- I'm, I am.
- Make mom proud.
- I'm trying.
- Sean, I just gave you a house.
The least you could do is
load the beans quicker.
- Is this all the pudding?
- This is all the pudding.
- Here's your 3D Dino sandwich box.
- Yay. Thank you.
- No problem.
He's so easy to keep happy.
We have literally filled
up over 300 carts so far.
Cumulatively, across all the checkouts,
we've spent over 70 grand so far.
We're only like 20% of the way there.
- Yeah, we got a long way to go.
- I'm gonna go call my bank.
So far, we've cleared this aisle.
We're almost done with this aisle.
And this one as well.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
We didn't get everything.
We forgot this one goldfish.
- Eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it.
- I don't-
- We started buying stores 20 hours ago.
It's been a long day for me and the boys.
I talked to the manager and
we both agree it's best for the community
if I only buy half the store.
And don't worry, they have a food truck
landing in literally an hour.
Everything will be restocked
by tomorrow morning.
- Change the title to
four and a half stores.
- Shut up.
- So like I said, we didn't
end up buying the entire store.
We only bought half of it.
We wanted to be responsible
and leave food here for our community.
But half a Food Lion is
still really expensive.
So what's the total?
- $122,082 and 15 cents.
- 122,000, I can live with that.
Look at how long the receipt
is, I'm not even joking.
It actually might be tied
with the GameStop receipt.
It is so long.
We currently have seven
U-Hauls full of food out front
and we're gonna take them to a food pantry
and give all the food to people in need.
We are now at my food
pantry with eight U-Hauls.
Apparently there was an extra
one I didn't even know about.
Filled to the brim with food.
Look at how epic this looks.
And this right here is my partner, Darren.
So when we adopted all the
dogs at an animal shelter,
he worked there and I really liked him.
And so I was like, Hey, you
wanna help me run a food pantry?
And he was like
- You don't say no to MrBeast.
- That's literally what he said.
And so, yeah, he moved down here
and he is helping me run this food pantry.
And I haven't told you guys
much about my food pantry yet
but so far we've given
out over 30,000 meals
and that food out front might
help us double that number.
I made a separate channel
called Beast Philanthropy
where I plan on doing
blogs about our food pantry
and just helping people in genuine need.
I really want to change lives.
And hopefully one day we
can feed millions of people
with this food pantry.
- We're gonna do it.

PKtnafFtfEo,"- What's up, YouTube?
I think we can all agree that 2020
might be the only thing in existence
worse than 2018 Rewind.

- [MrBeast] Because of
the global pandemic,
thousands of creators
just couldn't make videos.
It was brutal and I can't blame YouTube

Not gonna lie, it's actually
more than I thought it was.
And what you see on your screen now
is every single channel that hit
1 million subscribers in 2020.
Holy crap.
My editor didn't feel
like typing them all out
So here's just a video of me scrolling
through the Excel sheet.
Each one of these names represents someone
that hits a million
subscribers in just 2020.
Now to wrap things up,
I have a fishbowl full
of random small channels.
I'm going to draw a channel
like this and give them a plug.
So Amelia and Bridie, shout out to you.
You'll be linked in description below.
Now, I just wanna say that I tried my best
to cover the international
scene but to be honest,
I only know how to speak English.
So it's kind of hard for
me to include you guys
but shout out to... how do you say this?
- [Man Off Camera] Soyan Osman.
- Soyan Osman with 241 subscribers.
Shout out to you.
I wanted to also give a
quick shout out to PewDiePie.
My Rewind was heavily inspired
by his Rewind that he did in years past.
I even used the same editors he did.
Felix, I love you.
Thank you so much for the inspiration.
If you're not already subscribed to him,
you probably already are.
And our final shout out of the Rewind,
nalterdeeds with 1400 subscribers.
Make sure you subscribe to all
three of the small creators.
I thought it'd be a fun
way to end the Rewind.
I'm sure it'd mean the world to them
and thank you so much for watching.
Oh! Oh, that's hot.
(explosion)
That's hot.

f0c7pSCoZqE,"- I bought over one
million Christmas lights.
And not only did I buy all
these Christmas lights,
but I also bought these three houses.
Shaun, you decorate this house,
Cassidy, this is your house,
and this is Sarah's house.
Whoever's house looks
the best will keep it.

- Yeah.
- Let's go, we got this.
- All right.
It starts now.

- Hurry Mark.
(suspenseful music)
- I got this one, I picked it out.
Why would you steal my light?
There's literally like 2 million.
- Wait, you get yours.
- No, no, no, don't do that. Don't.
(suspenseful music)
- We're gonna go with
a MrBeast themed house.
We're gonna manipulate Jimmy

I'll point and tell you what to do.
- This is my house.

- I don't know.
- What? Look at this.
- Why'd you grab the tangled one?
- I don't know.
- There's a million lights
over there and you grab
these, of all them.
- There's actually 2 million.
- You're right, I have a confession.
So, one million looks better in the title,
but there's actually like 1.7
million lights over there.
- He click baited.
- I have a million, but it's 1.7 million.
Click baiting would've been two million.
- So, that reverses everything.
- The challenge is
officially underway, Shaun,
and if this house looks
the best, it's yours.
You literally have a house.
How old are you?
- 18.
(upbeat music)
- It's crazy how they put so
many lights on their houses,
and they barely made a dent in this pile.
Chris's house is looking really nice.
Chris, you're doing a good job.
- You sure about that?
- Karl, you're doing a good job.
- [Karl] Thank you.
- Chandler's house on the other hand is-
- [Cassidy] Is what?
- Whoever's house looks
the best, keeps the house.
- [Chandler] I know.
- We'll just move on.
Meeting!
- Oh my God.
- Hey, you okay?
- I ran as fast as I could.
- You guys are probably wondering,
how are we gonna determine
which house looks the best?
Well, here's how.
We have four judges and tomorrow morning
they're gonna rate each of your houses.
Our first judge is MatPat,
the host of Game Theory,
this channel, this channel, this channel
and all these other channels.
Our second judge is
Quackity, come on up here.
- I'm taking bribes.
- And our third judge is Damaris.
She is a random subscriber
that we randomly picked.
The fourth judge is probably
the smartest human being on the planet.
He's probably really great at everything.
Yeah, our fourth judges
is me. Hey everybody.
(spectators cheering)
We're gonna rate your houses
on a scale of 1 to 10.
Whoever has the most
points, after all four of us
judge their house, wins the house.
- Let's go.
- All right.
- Why are you wasting time?
Get back to decorating.
- Yeah.
(Christmas music)
I got some pliers here.
- Sheers, to be specific.
- I have some sheers here.
Chandler, you can clamp
one string of lights.
- [Chandler] Yeah.
- Oh no, it got the bush.
It got all the bushes.
- You get to cut one
cord on Chandler's house.
- Be nice, I'm in last.
- You can cut one of the ones dangling.
- That's what I thought.
- Oh my goodness. No.
- Wait, scratch that Chris.
- That's my favorite.
- Oh, before you do it,
I want you to look Cassidy in the face.
- Oh! It did all of
them, it did all of them.
- Yes.
- Karl, you better destroy him.
- Chris, this is the only strand of lights
that leads to top of your house.
If he cuts this, does he cut everything?
- Please, don't cut that one.
- Did it cut off the roof?
- No, that light does nothing!
- There, I only lost a bush.
So, hey we're chillin'.
- Actually, you lost three bushes.
- I'd say our only
competitor is Karl right now,
and this is war, we're taking him down.
- It's funny how Chandler's pissed off
but he's taking it out on his own house.
He's mad that he's falling behind
and setting himself more behind.
- This is pointless. Why is this here?
This stupid stuff, doesn't mean anything.
Letters to Santa, guess
what? They're empty.
Is that a tree?
- Did he just, he just tackled the tree.
- These are our trees, Karl!
(explosion)
- Technically that's
sabotage, but it's funny.
So, I'll let it slide.
(country Christmas music)
- All right, we're clearly behind.
I need to call everyone I
know, we are going to win this.
Let's do it. Hello, help?
- [Announcer] Five minutes later.
- I'm glad y'all are here
'cause we're exhausted.
- I was home snoozing in
the bed, counting sheep.
- Let's get it.
- Look, we got to make
a comeback.
- The Hallows are here to win.
- We can win!
- Do not doubt these people,
no more.
- Let's get it.
- Win!
- Yeah.
- All right.
- Let's get it.
(suspenseful music)
- I'm really exhausted. I
think my family's got it down.
I'm gonna go to sleep, take a nap.
And then be back before the,
you know, before it's over.
Good night.
- So, Chandler just went to bed.
- What?
- And he said,
""You're taking over the leadership.""
- I can't even believe
that boy lasted this long,
to start with.
- You guys have been doing a good job.
The pile is starting to deplete.
As you guys know, I bought over
1 million Christmas lights,
but that's not all I bought.
I also bought hundreds
of inflatable decorations
and you guys can use them.
- Sweet.
- Now?
- Yeah. Go for it.
- Hey, come on. Snowman's mine.
- He's mine.
- What are you, you're gonna take him off?
- No.
- Shaun you have-
- No.
(suspenseful music)
- That's so difficult.
- Oh my God. It's so hard.
- So difficult.
- I got chills
and it's not just because
it's 38 degrees outside.
It's because there are 10 minutes left!
- Guys, guys. We got less
then 10 minutes, come on.
(suspenseful music)
- Judges. Are you ready?
- As ever.
- I was born ready.
- Let's do it.
(blows air horn and clapping)
- Let's go.
- That's it.
- That's it.
- We are gonna be judging
the houses one at a time,
starting with Chris's house.
So, if you're not on Chris's team, leave.
Like I said before, we have
cards ranging from 1 to 10
and before we rate Chris's house,
we need to do a tour of it.
Chris, you have five
minutes to show us anything
and everything about your house.
Judges, give him your undivided attention.
- So, the theme is
actually MrBeast videos.
So the first one, we have a
lot of snow, a lot of ice,
from I spent 24 hours in an ice block.
Do you recognize this thumbnail?
- Deserted islands.
- Yes. See, that's the palm tree.
- That's pretty creative.
- Let's see if you guys can guess
what MrBeast video this is.
- Oh, I know this one.
Adopting all the dogs in a dog shelter.
- Yes, look at these cute little dogs.
They're all hanging out.
- Dude, this is actually pretty creative.
- For the final video,
we have theme trees.
One of the best videos of all time.
One of my personal favorites.
- This laptop's hooked up to a drone.
What did you wanna show us?
- If you guys see that, it says,
""Sup, to Quackity and MatPat.""
- Let's go, let's go.
- Did it say sup to MrBeast too?
- Well, so-
- I know what I need to know.
Time is up. Judges, select your
score and put it face down.
- My sister needs this
house so bad guys, please.
- Let's start with MatPat.
What are you rating their house out of 10?
- I'm giving it a 10.
- Oh, oh.
- Yes, yes.
- Whoa, a 10 out of 10.
- I am rating it a nine.
- Yeah!
- What? Oh my gosh.
- A nine.
- Thank you.
- I'm giving them a 10.
- Yeah!
- Whoa!
- Obviously this was creative.
I don't know if it was a 10.
There were a little things here and there.
My score was, don't hate me, I love you.
It's nothing personal. An eight outta 10.
- That's not bad.
- I think that's pretty good.
- I don't know why you hate
me, but that's not that bad.
- If neither of them score a 37 or higher,
you win your $300,000 house.
Head on over to the dungeon.
I'll let you know what they score.
- All right.
- Great job.
- Up next is the Hallow
family. Let's go on a tour.
- We welcome Santa every year,
with his favorite saying.
Ho, ho, ho. We have snow
with the north pole, yes.
Right up there, that's the landing strip
where Santa likes to land
and take off, to bring gifts.
- Chandler. What does this say back here?
- [Chandler] It spells out BEAST.
- Ooh, why didn't you
just start off with this?
- Well, it's the back.
- We're starting off with MatPat.
What do you rate their house, outta 10?
- An eight out of 10, solid.
- My score is another solid eight.
- Okay, all right, all right.
- Okay.
- I am going to give you
guys a lucky number seven.
Please, don't hate me.
- I'm also gonna rate it a seven.
There are some, you know,
things here or there
that could be better.
Scored it, 30 out of 40.
I can't tell you what Chris scored.
Now we're gonna judge Karl's house.
- So you had over a million lights?
We had probably half of
that in the front lawn.
I don't think it's a contest
on who has the most lights.
- Agreed, you guys really put
lights everywhere on the lot.
I will give that to you.
I will admit, I like what
they did with the lights here.
This is kind of cool.
- Party.
- This is legit.
- What if I were to tell you
there's an entire backyard?
- What is this?
- Oh my God.
- What is this?
- Oh my God, no!
- Look at the blue around our backyard.
- It's a YouTube sub-button.
- [Jimmy] MatPat, start us off.
- I gotta say this was a
really solid house, guys.
Only thing that was missing was a theme
and for that, I give you a nine.
- Oh.
- Very solid.
- My score for you guys
is also a solid nine.
- I gave you guys a 10.
- Oh, oh!
- Yes!
- I give it a nine, which means you guys
have the exact same score Chris has.
What is up with you people?
Now people think our videos are rigged.
Why would you do this?
I'm sending Tyler to get a fifth judge.
One of the fans over there watching.
They're gonna decide which house wins.
- [Announcer] A few moments later.
- The tie is between that
house and that house.
So what I want you to do is I
want you to take a quick lap
around that house and that house
and form an opinion on
which one you like better.
- I'm so nervous 'cause our
whole thing is the theme
and she's not gonna
understand it, probably.
- That's the reason it
tied in the first place
is 'cause he didn't think I had a theme.
- Ashley doesn't know
whose house is whose,
so she's not being biased.
So, purely based on the
lights on the houses
which one did you think
was decorated the best?
- I'm going with this one!
(everyone cheering and clapping)
- We did it.
Dude, we didn't stop working all night
and it paid off.
I can't believe it, holy cow.
- 12 hours, 12 straight
hours of hard labor.
Yeah, I'm in high school.
- Shaun's literally
a high schooler with the house.
Holy cow.
- I'm a senior.
- Congrats, dude.
- Now I know you two
must be very sad, but,
as you remember, there was
a car in your driveway.
Let's walk over to it.
You may not have won this
house but the runner up prize
is the car in the driveway.
- I know it's a car and
it's really awesome.
But compared to a house it still hurts.
- I have a confession to make.
You didn't actually win this house.
- What?
- What did we win?
- Now, I know I said at
the start of the video
that I bought these three
houses and that was a lie.
But I did buy a $300,000
house down the road
and here's me giving it to Shaun.
I can't wait to see Shaun's reaction.
Come on in to your brand new home.
- Oh my God.
- As I said before, this house cost
over $300,000 and it is all yours.
- Holy cow.
(explosion)"
dg2Ag3e8W-Q,"- I opened up the world's
first free restaurant.
And if that wasn't enough,
I also paid people to
eat at my restaurant.
We haven't even opened yet
and the police just told us
they had to shut down a mile of traffic
and there's a thousand cars in line.
Put it on up.
Yeah.
- Yeah.
I've never ran a restaurant before.
Money for you, money
for you, money for you.
Money for you. You better
come get a Beast Burger!
What's up, boys?
Welcome. What can I get you?
All we have is burgers.
Be right back, one sec.
We need four burgers.
- [Kitchen Workers] Four.
- Four burgers.
- I've never done this in my life.
- Guys, we're making our
first customers wait.
I'm sorry for making wait,
here's a hundred dollars.
- Oh, thank you.
- You might wanna give another a hundred,
it's gonna be a second.
- Chris said it'll be a
second, here's another hundred.
- Oh my God.
- Go, Mr. Beast.
- We got burgers now.
- We got burgers.
- Here's a burger.
(Jimmy laughing)
(rock music)
- Cooking is way harder
than I thought it was.
So, you're gonna have to stall people.
- Play the clip of the line.
(man laughing)
There's no stalling,
we're blocking traffic.
- Figure it out.
- Oh my goodness.
Carl, the line is too long I
need you to just grab burgers
and just start go giving them away.
You two, go, go.
- Hi, hi, hi, here.
- Hi.
- Hi. I already ran out, oh God, okay.
- Hi, who wants burgers?
Thank you. Want burgers, burgers?
- I'm not gonna lie, I
thought owning a restaurant
would be easier.
It's actually kind of hard.
(upbeat music)
- Check the back out! Check the back out!
- Oh, show, hey! Hey, check the back.
- Hey, look at our merch.
Aim, big stack of cash.
- Whoa. Woohoo. Jimmy, Jimmy.
- Oh my God, that's amazing.
Give them stacks of money.
- Stacks of money.
(girls screaming)
- I'm freaking out.
- Things are taking too long,
so we're just gonna start
going to the cars.
- I've got money.
- Wait, I have burgers.
- Here's a burger and some money.
(women screaming)
Bye, it's nice meeting you.
- Thank you.
- Here you go. Enjoy.
Dude, I don't have any burgers right now
but here's a hundred dollars.
- Thank you, bro.
- Yeah, man.
I love your shirt, here you go.
- Thank you.
- No problem.
There's so many people, we
need to make more burgers.
Three, two, one. Here you go.
All right, close it. Close it, close it.
We gotta go quick to keep up with demand.
Comment down below if you've
ever worked in fast food.
It's stressful. Where's the flavor?
This is my last one, this
is it. This is all I have.
- Chandler, I heard you ran out of money.
- Yeah, what about it?
- Here's $200,000.
- What?
- There you go. He should be good.
- Wow.
- Till the burgers catch up,
just keep giving away money, okay.
- All right, sounds good.
Gotta give away money 'cause
we don't have any food ready.
All right.
One, two, three, four,
boom, boom, boom, boom.
Got no food, sorry.
- Brad.
- In this bag,
I'm putting a burger
and in this bag I'm
putting a bunch of AirPods
and a ton of money.
Let's see what they pick.
Hey, would you rather
have this bag on the left
or this bag on the right?
- The one on the left.
- This one? Okay, well congratulations.
This bag is a burger and fries
and this bag is a ton
of money and AirPods.
So, here you go.
- Yeah. What there's
more then just one here.
What? Can I still get
the food, is that okay?
- All right, fine. You can
still have food, here you go.
- Thanks bro, holy crap.
- I wanted to check on
the line but the thing is
nothing changed, there's
still a ton of cars.
I never publicly shared this address.
That is literally, just
people seeing the billboard
out front.
(upbeat music)
♪ Woo ♪
- I got three so far. I know, I know.
- Hey, you guys want a burger?
- I severely underestimated
how many people
would come for free food.
I'm calling all of my
friends, we need backup.
Guys, guys, I have good
news. Bailey's here to help.
- [Kids] Yay.
- I know you've never made food before,
but just throw burgers together.
Get in here, go, go, go.
Just start making things.
Give me that camera. Go make some burgers.
- Go, we need help.
- Okay, okay, okay. All right.
- How much money have you
given away at the window?
- A lot.
- How much food have we given away?
- A lot.
- I'm going broke.
- You could just charge people money.
(record scratches)
- Get outta here.
He suggested we charge money for the food.
- Not.
- Get outta here. Go.
I don't ever wanna hear you
guys talk about charging again.
Wait Terry, are you holding a camera, man?
Get that camera outta your
hand. You're not a cameraman.
- Chandler, you hold the
camera. Just go film things.
- Okay. I like holding this camera.
It's really easy of a job.
I mean, anyone can do this.
- For an unorganized
restaurant full of people
that have no idea what they're doing,
I'd say we're doing pretty good.
(people hollering)
- Okay, how many people? Oh my God.
- There's so many people.
- Holy smokes.
There's so many people.
You guys seem to be the
exact last people in line.
So, I figured I'd give you
guys a snack to hold you off.
Okay.
- Okay, thank you.
- Oh wow.
- We have two burgers left,
guys.
- Thank you.
- Just to hold you guys off. All right.
We gotta get back. Jimmy needs us.
- All right.
- He needs more burger boys.
- We need to get more burgers.
(upbeat music)
- Put the burger in the bag
and here's some napkins.
- We ran out of napkins so
we just put money in there.
- Oh, thank you. Bye.
- Thanks. Bye.
- How much money have we given away?
Eric called every single
chef that he knows
and they're outside waiting.
Are we ready to bring 'em in?
- Let's go get 'em.
- All right. We're about
to bring in an army.
All right, come on in everybody.
They keep coming.
- You're on mail.
You're on mustard.
- Keep on coming.
- You're on the grill.
- Keep 'em, what?
You're on rent.
- How many people do we get?
- You're on cheese.
- Oh my God.
- You're on the burger.
- We shouldn't have to struggle anymore.
Now that we have a ton of extra help here,
we can keep up with demand.
So, we're gonna open up a second window.
We're gonna start accepting cars
on both sides of the restaurant.
Chris, you wanna man this side?
- I got it.
- All right, let's do it.
Carl, You have competition now.
Chris is open across the aisle.
- That's not Chris.
- Hey, we need a book bag
full of money over here.
- Here's some cash for
you and Chris's window.
For this next customer,
let's give away two iPads
because we're not letting
their window show us up.
- Screw their window. Here's
two iPads, here you go.
Have a fantastic day.
- Oh, thank you.
- His window's doing really well.
- Yeah. Well it's been-
- He just gave away iPads out his window.
- Well, give me iPads.
- Good idea.
Here's some Apple products
you can give away.
- All right. So I only
have one Beast Burger
but there's a bunch of cash in there
and then here's a brand new iPad.
- Name one other restaurant
that looks like this and this.
Everyone that ordered food
today got really lucky.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- This is the cash register.
- What? No.
- There's some money in there.
- Are you?
He just gave us a cash register.
- Money, money.
- What do we got, like four hours left
and we're only a third of the way done.
We got all these buns to
get rid of and that rhymed.
I think. Did it rhyme?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- How's it going? How's it going?
- How are you?
How many of you guys? Five?
- There's five of us.
- Their car got hit
while they were waiting.
- We got side swiped.
- You got side swiped? No way.
They got side swiped
while they were waiting.
- Wait, really? Hold up, right here.
- Whoa.
- Holy cow.
- You got side swiped.
Did they stop for you or just-
- No, she just kept going.
- Oh dang. Well, we have good news.
Give me a second.
I may or may not have bought
an extra car to give away.
This morning I went to
my friend, I was like,
""Hey, I think I'm gonna
wanna give away a car.
Can you buy one?"" And
he just bought us a car.
So, if you can hear us over
all the screaming people,
this is the car I bought.
I bought that car this morning
on an impulse, to give away.
And since you got side swiped,
I thought we might as well
give it to you.
- Mm-mm.
- Yes.
- No, 'cause I was just
sitting here complaining about
how we was gonna get my car fixed.
Thank you.
- No problem.
Are you crying? Oh,
she's gonna make me cry.
- No, getting this is like, for real,
I've worked hard for everything I got.
I don't get nothing handed to me.
- Oh my gosh. I can't handle this.
But here you want to come
check out your new car.
(people screaming)
- It's awesome, right?
- Thank y'all so much.
Y'all are such a blessing, like, for real.
- [Man] Yo, do what?
Blessings, on blessings, on blessings.
Subscribe to MrBeast, I just did.
(rock music)
- Apparently one of the cars
ran outta gas waiting in line.
So, we're gonna go fill it up.
Word on the street is
you guys ran outta gas.
- We ran out of gas a while ago.
- Oh really? All right, well
Chris is gonna fill you up.
That's funny. Chris, you no
longer work in the restaurant.
You're just the gas man.
I'm gonna leave you in the hands of Chris.
I'm gonna go give away more food.
- They're not very capable
hands, I'm not gonna lie.
(upbeat music)
- So, I heard that your car broke.
So it turns on, but then
it turns off. Ah, gotcha.
There's a lot of people watching us.
I feel kind of scared to give them money.
So, here you go. Transfer,
transfer, there you go.
There's a lot of people watching.
Here's $10,000 to fix your car.
(family screaming)
We're surrounded by hundreds of people.
We just gave him 10 grand.
I feel like for our safety,
we should go back inside.
- We should definitely go back inside.
- Even though we were
rushing to feed people
as fast as possible, there was literally
a 20 mile line of cars
and long story short,
we might've been holding up traffic a bit.
And after talking with the local police,
who were very helpful and understanding,
we decided to be responsible
and close to restaurant early.
And these are our final 30 customers.
(rock music)
This next person is our last customer.
How's it going?
So you guys are actually the last people.
Here's three burgers for everyone.
Oh, and also, since you guys were last,
here's a bunch of money.
I don't know what you're
gonna do with it, but...
- You serious, brother?
Yeah, there we go. Bye, and
that was our last customer."
LeYsRMZFUq0,"- This is $1 million in cash.
Now I'm gonna give
random people one minute
to try to spend all this money.
Karl start the timer.
You guys have 60 seconds,
whatever you put in
this cart I will pay for
up to $1 million.
(crickets chirping)
Starting now.
- Go, go.
- It's been six seconds.
(upbeat music)
Oh, that's a big TV for our cart.
- [Chris] Who wants one more TV?
(upbeat music continues)
- It's almost been a minute.
It's almost been a minute.
Almost been a minute.
Oh, and it has been officially a minute.
On the dot, no extra time.
You did good, little man.
I told these guys I'd pay
for whatever they put in this card.
Let's see the damage.
Holy crap, you grabbed so many gift cards.
And these are $10 to $500.
Look how many he grabbed.
$13,000 in gift cards.
Play back him grabbing these in slow mo
and put ""Play of the day.""
(dramatic music)
Oh, boys.
They managed to spend
$18,000 in under a minute,
which is below $1 million.
So congratulations, you guys
get to keep all this stuff.
- Yeah!
(boys cheering)
- Our next location is this
entire jewelry store here.
Jewelry is really expensive.
As you can see, this stuff
here costs $900,000 by itself,
and all this stuff here cost $1.3 million.
And of all the stores,
if someone was to spend $1
million, this would be it.
For this next one we have
Ashley here. Here's a bowl.
In a second I'm gonna start this timer.
Whatever you put in this bowl
before this timer hits
30 seconds, I'll pay for.
Starting now.
(group yelling)
- Go. Go. What do you want?
What do you want? Tell me, tell me.
- Just put it in the bowl.
- Chandler.
Chandler, catch.
- [Ashley] Can I go over there?
- Oh, golden necklace.
- Hurry.
- [Ashley] Yes.
- Go, yeah. Go see Karl.
- Nice, Karl. Yes, yes.
- Of course. Of course.
- [Jimmy] It's only been five seconds.
- I love this necklace right here.
- You love this necklace?
- Yes, I love it.
- I got this necklace. She
loves the necklace, Jimmy!
- Five, four,
- Oh, yes, that ring, perfect.
Perfect. Oh, yep yep yep yep.
- three, two, one.
Oh, okay. Times up, times up. Okay.
That's a lot of really expensive jewelry.
Let's go see the damage.
Is this like real?
- That is 18 karat gold.
- This is $5,800? There's
so much more here.
- [Karl] It looks like
you just robbed a pirate.
- [Chandler] What are you
gonna do with all of it?
- Givin' some gifts away.
- That's true,
- Keep some of it.
- [Chandler] It's Christmas time.
- Christmas time.
- We just finished scanning
what felt like a hundred items of jewelry.
What's the damage? Oh my.
- 60,990.
- Yeah!
- Wait, what?
- I can live with 60 grand.
I can live with that.
Boys, on three jump.
- Alright.
- One, two, three.
(explosion booming)
For this next store we
have a special guest.
- That's my brother.
- Whatever is in this cart when
this timer hits one minute,
I will pay for it, it is all yours.
Starting now.
(""Green Hill Zone"")
(boys shouting)
Wait, wait, wait. That was the joke.
I didn't actually start it.
- Oh. My bad.
- That was a joke.
That was a joke. Oh, but it is going now.
(""Green Hill Zone"")
- Does that cart count?
- [Sean] Games! Games! Games!
- [Chris] Goin' Fortnite.
- [Sean] I need all of this. I need all.
- [Karl] Keyboards will work for-
- [Jimmy] I don't know why
Sean jumped over this counter.
I wanna let you guys know
that we actually know
the owner of this store
and he was okay with everything we did,
but Sean got a little
carried away at some parts.
- [Cameraman] What are you doing?
- [Karl] Sean!
- Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.
- It's okay.
- Games!
- [Chris] Are we just grabbin' stuff?
- [Sean] Keep throwin'
games, keep throwin' games.
- Sean, I'm getting these Pokemon cards!
- [Jimmy] 54 seconds. 55 seconds.
- Gotta get these.
- 56 seconds.
- Two. One.
- I need it!
I need it all!
- Done. Done. Done. Done.
First things first, we made a mess.
Everyone, we need to pick up.
Anything on the floor, put in
the cart, we gotta pay for.
- PS4.
- Who grabbed a whole
PlayStation 4 Pro
with no box?
- Ya boy.
- Where even was this?
- I found it.
(upbeat music)
(scanner beeping)
- I'm smiling underneath this
mask, but you can't tell.
Thanks to Jimmy for
giving me all these games.
Obviously I don't need all this,
so I'm gonna be giving a lot of it away
to friends and donating it.
And, yeah.
- Next up we have John Deere.
We're gonna do something special.
Our contestant is actually Chris's father.
- Yeah, he's a farmer. Let's do it.
- So before we begin,
I need clarification.
Chris, is this your father?
- That is my father.
- Now that we got that out
the way, we can proceed.
You have 30 seconds and anything
you touch, I will pay for.
Since he's your father,
we're not gonna make him put it in a cart,
'cause it'd be hard to
put a lawnmower in a cart.
So anything he touches
I will pay for starting-
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Oh, wait, what? What?
Wait.
- I gotta make this easier.
- I'm gonna go ahead and start the timer.
Starting now, go!
(upbeat country music)
(prices dinging)
- Touch the jet pack, touch the jet pack!
(Chris yelling)
- Touch this tractor.
- More coolers?
He's touchin' everything in the store.
- [Karl] He touched a tractor!
- [Cameraman] I don't even need to help.
- [Jimmy] It looks like Chris
pulled up something for you.
I forgot they actually sell tractors here.
- Touch it.
- Time.
Wait, how much is this?
- I think like 50 or 60 grand.
- Who woulda thought
that the person at the John
Deere store would spend more
than the person at the jewelry store.
- I knew we were gonna do this store,
so I made sure to get him a tractor
and pull it right up to the door.
He had like two seconds
left. It was clutch.
Now you finally know what it feels like
to spend Jimmy's money like I do.
- We're grabbing everything he touched
and putting it in this pile here.
Look at all this stuff.
- Why does he need 17 weed whackers?
- How did you do this in 30
seconds? Did you actually run?
- Yeah.
- I don't think I've ever
seen your run in my life.
- I wanna thank Mr. Jimmy,
Mr. Beast and everybody.
It'll make life a lot
easier. A lot simpler.
- The total of everything here is $30,000.
And if you include the tractor out front,
it is over 80 grand is
what you managed to spend.
- Let's go!
- That is insane.
We are now in Walmart.
This time I'm gonna give the
next person a little more time.
This is Jordan. You told
me you're a school teacher?
- I am.
- Okay. How many students do you have?
- On my roster, about 91.
- Jordan, we wanted to
do something special
for your students.
Here's a shopping cart.
- Okay.
- Anything you put in this shopping cart,
we will pay for for your students.
I'm gonna start this timer here.
Anything that's in this cart
in five minutes, I'll pay for.
Alright, timer started.
- For the students.
For the students.
- Okay. Just for the students.
(upbeat music)
Let's just grab TVs for your students.
- How 'bout some gamer headsets?
- Yes. Yes.
- Okay. There we go.
- [Chris] I got a vacuum cleaner,
'cause children are messy.
- Yes. They need that.
- Alright, two minutes has gone by.
You got three minutes left.
- What else? What else?
What else? What else?
- Can we just have all your laptops?
- Notebooks.
- The keys aren't working.
- Okay.
We might have to come back
to the laptops in a bit.
Let's go somewhere else.
That sucks they couldn't
open up the laptop.
As you can see, we did
cross the five minute mark,
but I just don't feel
like this is enough stuff.
Your students deserve more.
Here's what I'm gonna do.
Oh wow, it reset.
Well you have five minutes, let's go.
- Okay, let's do it.
They could definitely use
headphones. Projector.
- Hello.
- Okay, I'm gonna go find you
a good cart of goodness, okay?
- Okay.
- It's gonna be good.
- I trust you.
- They finally opened up the laptops.
- School supplies
comin' through for the kids.
- Oh my goodness.
(upbeat show music)
- There's no PlayStation's,
only controllers.
- Five seconds left.
- Alright.
- Three.
- Oh, this.
- Two.
I mean, one, let's throw more lamps.
Oh.
- Yes.
- Did you just grab a
giant rack of light bulb?
The time is up, but this
isn't her only cart.
She also had the cart full
of supplies from Chris,
her other cart that she filled up,
and Karl said he was filling up a cart.
I think we did good work.
Let's go check out.
- I did great.
- [Jimmy] What did you get?
- Listen, kids love snacks.
- You know who else love snacks?
- Who?
- Me.
- Oh no.
- They're gonna be elated.
They're gon' be in shock,
for sure.
- Yeah.
(upbeat music)
(scanner beeping)
In these carts is over
$10,000 worth of stuff
for her students.
And we didn't wanna leave
Jordan empty handed,
so we have a surprise for her.
Shaun, bring it on in.
This is Shaun, our bodyguard,
because we're in the middle of Walmart.
Thank you for the briefcase
and making sure I don't die.
Jordan, congratulations,
here is $10,000 in cash.
- No. No. No. No.
- You're gonna make me cry.
- Just don't know. I just don't know.
Oh my God. Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.
We have so many bills
that need to be paid,
and Christmas is comin' up.
My son's birthday is Friday
- Oh, really.
- and we weren't gonna be able
to get him things that he wanted.
My husband's birthday is the 21st,
he was just willing not to get anything
because things are so behind.
And so I'm just so grateful.
- I'm just really glad
the money and all that
just went to someone
who actually needed it.
That makes me really happy,
and yeah, we're gonna
head to the next store.
- Thank you so much.
- No problem.
Up next we're not at a store,
we're actually outside.
This is Mitch.
And Mitch, we have cars lined up for days,
- Whoa.
- cut to the drone shot.
So here's the deal.
Two football fields away is a
six figure Lamborghini, okay?
So basically we have a lot
of really expensive cars lined up,
the further away they are,
the more expensive the car is.
And I have a stopwatch here.
You have exactly one minute to get a car
and drive it across this finish line.
And if you do, you get to keep the car.
But, if you don't cross
the line, you're just shy,
you don't get the car.
- High risk, high reward?
- Exactly.
- Wow.
- So the second nicest car is a Tesla,
it's still worth over $40,000.
- Wow.
- So, gentlemen are you ready?
(Karl yelling)
- I'm ready! Woo!
- Let's go, Jimmy.
- Okay, he did it, he's gone.
The time is starting.
They're off in the truck.
- [Karl] Holy cow.
- Oh my God.
- Oh my gosh.
He's going so fast.
- [Chris] He's going for the Lambo!
Nevermind, he's going for the Tesla.
- Oh my gosh, is he gonna get it in time?
- Key.
- Where's the key?
- Oh no, he doesn't what he's doing.
The password's 6969!
- Someone help 'im!
- [Cameraman] Go, go, go.
(men yelling)
(intense music)
- [Karl] Oh my God it's really close.
- 10, 9, 8, 7.
And just in time, he got it.
With eight seconds to spare,
you just won a brand new tesla!
(men yelling)
- [Cameraman] You got it to the line!
- Oh my God. Are you serious?
- That is your Tesla.
- This GPS is bigger than my TV at home.
This is a dream right now.
This is literally a dream.
- Mitch is here because he's
a subscriber to the channel.
That's why we invited him to compete.
- Mr. Beast just gave me a Tesla
because I watch his videos,
I like his videos.
- It's that simple.
If you're not already,
hit the subscribe button,
we're gonna go to the next store.
- You're the man.
- To spice things up, I
literally made my own store,
but everything is wrapped as a present.
- I'm all cozied up.
- I don't know why that was relevant.
- I am all cozied up.
I don't know what to tell you.
First off, I need you to pick a number
between one and three.
- Three.
- So you, Brandon, have three minutes
to grab as many presents
as you can from here
and put them underneath
this Christmas tree.
I just started this timer,
which means you're
three minutes has begun.
- Just start throwin' stuff.
- And you might be
wondering, what is here?
Well, here's a couch.
- [Chris] How do you
know? It's wrapped up.
- Over a minute has elapsed.
You still got two minutes left.
- I can't pick this up, but
I don't know what it is.
- [Jimmy] Everything.
- It's so heavy.
- Oh, jeez.
- I dunno what it is.
Alright, so I should probably mention
that we only bought
really ex, a PS4, what?
Everything here is
actually kind of expensive.
(upbeat music)
Two minutes and 20 seconds has elapsed.
40 seconds remaining.
- Karl.
- [Jimmy] Brandon, you
got 25 seconds left.
- Hurry!
- 360.
(present boinging)
- Pick something else.
Eight, seven.
Alright, it's not even that
close, 'cause, alright.
Four, three, two, one.
Stop. Bazinga. Bazinga.
Three minutes has elapsed.
Alright, so let's go around the edge.
This isn't on the red,
so we gotta kick it out.
These are on. The Foreman grill is on.
What about this?
Oh.
- Oh.
- All I'm sayin' is I might
have to sneeze real quick.
- Hurry. Oh, wait.
(Jimmy mocking sneezing)
- Oh, okay. I finished my third sneeze.
- [Brandon] Looks like it's in.
- Okay. Good enough.
Congratulations on all
the brand new stuff.
You wanna just start opening some of it?
- Sure.
- Yo, let's go.
- You got some logs.
- Where is the ""Frozen?""
I got that specifically
for the four year old.
It's got Anna and Elsa.
It is
- A PS4.
- a PS4.
She'll love it.
- Ooh.
- It's a gamin' PC.
- I'm not gonna make you
watch us unwrap all of this.
On the screen is everything
else that he won.
- Been a dream come true.
Can't thank you enough, Mr. Beast.
It's gonna be a game changer
for the way our year has been.
- I'm proud, man. I hope
they have a great Christmas.
Honestly, I thought
he'd grab more presents
and we still have a bunch left over.
So I decided to let my security
guard, Shaun, have a go.
Shaun, you need a recliner!
- Yes, I do.
Come on, pick it up. Pick it.
Is this a lawnmower? It
looks like a lawnmower.
- Hey Shaun, if you hate giant
70 inch TVs, don't grab this.
- Oh, I'm grabbin'.
The kids'll love it for their room.
- Congratulations,
Shaun, on all this stuff.
Because you're super muscular,
you were able to fit a bunch in here.
Don't try to mess with
us, look at this man.
- This is a heck of a surprise.
My kids are gonna love it.
You're all about the kids,
that's why I like keeping you safe.
- We are now at Karl's house.
- Why do we keep coming here?
- Meet Matt. Matt, meet Karl.
- Hello, Matt.
- Try touching this TV.
You touched the TV.
Let's get it outta here.
- Oh my God.
- Okay, there we go.
You now own that TV.
Karl, I owe you a TV
that's twice as expensive.
- Ooh.
- That's how it works.
You have 19 touches left.
You can touch anything in Karl's house.
- Well, I just got an Xbox.
- There you go. Hey!
- Alright, well.
Does that mean I have
to buy Karl two Xbox Xs?
- Where's his room?
- Oh, my room's up there.
- Upstairs.
Matt, Matt, Matt. What are
you touching right now?
- Door knob.
- You're touching a doorknob.
- I got it.
- Okay.
That is touch number three of Matt's.
Matt, you just earned yourself a doorknob.
- [Karl] I just got two door knobs.
- [Matt] Alright.
- Okay.
It's kind of a blanket, but
we'll include the mattress too.
I think so.
- Gonna be number four.
- [Karl] Another TV?
- MacBook.
- Karl, you just keep it,
I'll just buy him a MacBook
that's twice as good.
- We shoulda thought of
that with the mattress.
- Yeah.
(glass tinkling)
Oh.
- That's my Monster mini fridge.
- [Chris] Here's your doorknob.
- Oh yeah. Thank you so much.
- I want more VR.
- You're enjoying this
more than you should.
Hey, hey, Tareq, can I see that?
- Oh yes.
- There you go. This is now yours.
- [Chris] You got Tareq's job.
- AirPods.
- Sure. Alright, boom.
18, 19, one more touch.
Oh no, a Q-tip fell. Oh, darn.
(boys yelling)
- Oh, no.
- Tyler just mentioned that
he coulda touched the house.
- But you got a Q-tip, so that's cool.
- I thought about touchin' the house,
big brainin' it, but I didn't.
Didn't think I was gonna get
this. I need one of these.
Got the bed. I got the Xbox.
Super excited, super stoked.
- I got two PCs. I got two beds.
Dude, if a girl comes over
she'll have a place to sleep.
- Aye!
Some of the people we
selected in this video
were random subscribers.
So if you're not already,
hit that subscribe button
because you could

There's no reason not to. It's free."
Dc2ZRmuH5OM,"- This is a giant $100,000 diamond,
and protecting it is the most
advanced security system in the world.
And these guys are each gonna be
trying to steal the diamond.
Turn on the lasers.
This one is hard.
All right, Chris is going.
All right.
All right, Nolan's going.
- [Chris] Oh, that side's easier.
- [Nolan] I'm following Chris.
- [Karl] Go, you go first.
- [Nolan] No, you go first.
- [MrBeast] Chris, are
you about to lose a life.
- [Karl] Oh my God, yeah!
- [Chris] We did it.
- [Karl] Jump, jump.
- [Chandler] This is terrifying.
- [MrBeast] It's only $100,000 for your
brother or sisters on the line.
- [Karl] Oh, he's going,
he's going, he's going.
- Oh no, he did, he did it.
- Let's go.
- [Karl] Oh my gosh, I'm
gonna lose a life here.
- [MrBeast] Let's see it, all right Nolan,
Nolan's going, Nolan is going.
Yeah.
- [Nolan] Let's go.
Karl, get ready to lose a heart.
- [MrBeast] Karl, in front
of 20,000,000 people,
let's see it.
He's going, he's going, he's going.
He didn't touch a laser.
There you go.
All right boys, come on in.
- [Chris] Whoa.
- [Karl] No chance.
- [MrBeast] Whoever
finishes this course last
has to do the next one on one leg.
- [Karl] Ooh, this is gonna be tricky.
I'm just gonna follow
Nolan since he's safe.
- [MrBeast] Oh.
- Boom, I'm first.
- [Nolan] Oh, oh what's up?
It's Karl.
Karl hit it first.
- [Karl] Yes!
- [MrBeast] Karl hit it first,
which means Chandler you have
to do the next one on one leg.
- [Chandler] Oof.
- [Karl] Lasers, initiate.
(electronic beeping)
- [Group] Oh.
- [Karl] There are two colors this time.
- [MrBeast] Wait Chris,
oh, Chris is going.
Chris.
(group exclaiming)
- Ow.
- [MrBeast] Go through the
door to the next level.
Chris is down a heart,
Chandler you have to do it on one leg.
He's struggling to stand on his own.
- [Nolan] Chandler man.
Oh.
(group awwing)
- [Nolan] All right.
- All the boys be losing lives.
- [Karl] It's so hard.
- There we go, I'm sorry.
I would go strategize of how
you don't lose those lives.
And then there was two,
what are you guys waiting on?
- [Nolan] You were filming stuff.
- [Karl] Yeah.
- [MrBeast] No one has
been able to do it so far,
will Nolan complete the impossible?
No, watch out, watch out.
(bell dinging)
Get out of here.
(Nolan sighing)
Karl, everyone has lost a life.
- [Karl] Watch this, ready?
- There's no way he does this, no way.
Oh, oh.
Oh, he hit it.
(buzzer sounding)
You hit it.
I'm sorry, but even if
you are actually dead,
you lost a life.
And all four boys lost
a life on this course.
Since they all just lost a life,
I'm gonna put an extra life
right here and not tell them.
Shh.
For this next stage you can
go the second you walk in.
Start whenever.
- [Chris] Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
- [Nolan] Doing this fast
now, no more waiting.
- [MrBeast] Congratulations,
Chris got an extra life.
- Yeah, woo.
- Guys, you gotta be on your toes,
there's surprises.
- [Karl] I'm going to the next stage.
- [Chris] All right, bye.
- I'm going to take the giant diamond,
and they won't see this coming, watch.
I'm going to put it above the door.
So technically they could
just reach up and touch it,
but they won't.
And to distract them even more
I'm gonna put an extra life right here.
So they're gonna be focused on this,
and not even realize
the diamond's missing.
- [Chandler] Hello?
- [MrBeast] All right, come on in.
You can go whenever you want.
There might be something
on the ground over there.
- [Chandler] Oh my God, he did it.
- Boom.
- [MrBeast] Don't touch the laser.
- Get skinny, wait for them to go down.
- [MrBeast] Be careful,
don't touch the laser,
touch the box.
- Oh no, I'm stuck.
- [MrBeast] Wait, Karl join them.
- [Karl] Okay.
- [Chris] I'm nervous.
- I touched it.
(electronic dinging)
- Think about your sister,
this is more than you.
- [Nolan] Is there any
punishment for touching it last?
- [MrBeast] No.
- [Nolan] Oh, you just
wanted to waste our time?
(group exclaiming)
- [Karl] Oh, he's good.
- [Chandler] Touch it.
- [MrBeast] All right,
congratulations, you all passed.
Check it out.
You guys have to jump
on this, jump on this,
through this, onto the padding.
- Okay, so we're all losing a life.
- [MrBeast] Wait, Chris are you ready?
- [Karl] He's going.
- [Group] Oh.
- [MrBeast] He did it.
- [Karl] No, he hit the top for sure.
- Oh no, play it back in slow mo.
(melancholic music)
- There we go.
- [MrBeast] I'll take that.
- There you go.
- [MrBeast] All right,
see you at the next level.
All right, let's see it,
Chandler's going, boom.
Boom.
(group awwing)
He touched it too, dude you
guys keep kicking the top one.
- What?
- [MrBeast] Chandler go
ahead and take a heart off,
Nolan let's see you do it, let's go.
Boom, boom.
Pow.
I think he got it.
- [Nolan] Yes!
- Congratulations.
- Let's go.
- [MrBeast] Let's see if Karl's
an athletic freak of nature.
- I love both these hearts equally,
and I'm not gonna lose either.
Let's do this.
- [Chris] No, he hit it.
- [MrBeast] Did he?
- [Chris] Yeah.
(bell dinging)
- Karl your leg hit it.
- Here, I got it.
(Karl exclaiming)
- You only have one left.
- [MrBeast] The next time
you two mess up donezo.
All right, go to the next level.
- [Chris] Right through here.
- [MrBeast] Congrats
Nolan, you're doing good.
Nolan lost an $800,000 island,
and he lost $100,000 in this video.
If you lose again today,
you've lost $1,000,000
in videos, congrats.
(electronic beeping)
This next one is insane,
look how beautiful it is.
- [Karl] It's actually gorgeous.
- [Nolan] It's pretty nice.
- [MrBeast] One of you might
literally lose right now,
and don't forget who you're playing for.
- I found a heart.
- [Chris] And go.
- Hey, wait, wait.
Chandler you are quick,
I hid a heart over there
and Chandler found it.
- Go Nolan.
- Let's go!
- [Karl] He absolutely hit his noggin.
- We're watching the footage back
to see if the laser touched
Nolan before he touched the box.
- [Karl] It hit his noggin.
- See that little spot of
your head where it hit?
See your head where it's purple?
Barely half a second.
Here we go, all right,
welcome to the two heart gang.
Karl is the only person with one life,
if you touch that you're out.
- [Karl] Touch this?
- [Chris] I hate you.
- [MrBeast] Oh, he's
starting on the safe side.
- Yes I am, I have one life.
Oh, that got closer than I thought.
- [Nolan] Lay down.
- I think I might go.
- You going?
Go for it.
- [Chris] All right, he's doing it.
- Oh Karl's in, Karl's in.
And Chandler's in, you both made it.
- [Chandler] Let's go.
- [MrBeast] All right
Chris, you're the only one.
- I'm scared.
- [MrBeast] All right Chris, let's go,
what was that?
Oh your elbow hit it,
your elbow hit it and your head hit it.
- [Chris] Did it actually?
- [MrBeast] Yeah.
- Does it drop down?
- [Nolan] Yeah, it does.
- Oh, oh wait, it's way taller now.
- Yeah, that's what they were waiting for.
- Oh.
Oh.
That's how my heart is right now,
and I'm sure that's how
my brother's heart is.
- [Karl] I thought this
was the next stage.
- For this next one I have
LazarBeam himself on the line,
because we're using lasers, ironic.
- I get it.
- Is there anything you wanna say?
20,000,000 people are watching.
- Do I get money for
appearing in this video?
- No.
All right, so boys, come on in.
For this next course guys
I let Lazar pick it out,
he said he wanted it hard.
Turn on the lasers.
- [Karl] What?
- I'm also gonna let Landon
decide which two of you
are handcuffed together
for this next stage.
- Wait, what?
- Karl and Chandler.
- Yes!
- [MrBeast] Karl and Chandler,
all right.
- Lazar, see what you're doing to me?
- Thank you LazarBeam for coming out,
we're gonna go back to
playing with lasers.
All right Nolan as the
man with the most lives--
- Go.
- Technically go.
- [Chris] Nolan, Nolan's doing it.
- [MrBeast] Nolan's rolling.
- [Chris] No way he just did this.
- [MrBeast] Oh, he did it.
- Congratulations.
Oh, that one just appears,
and that one disappears.
- [Chandler] Oh Chris, Chris.
- [Chris] Ooh wee.
- [MrBeast] All right, will
he do it, will he do it,
will he do it?
Oh my goodness, he did it.
Now onto the handcuffed people.
- We're gonna step, step, step,
once we make it to the corner, shimmy.
- [Chandler] Come on, come on.
All right, watch out for that one
that's gonna appear.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
- [Karl] Go, go, go, go, go.
- [Chandler] Stop.
(Karl screaming)
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
(Karl screaming)
- Yeah, that's gonna need a replay.
- That's a photo finish.
- If somebody touched it it was him,
but yeah, we killed it.
- Yeah, yeah, wait what?
- Hand on.
- Yeah, theirs is good.
- Hands on, take that LazarBeam.
- For this next one whoever finishes first
their sibling gets $10,000.
I'm pretty sure they heard
me talking about the 10 K,
come on in.
- Yes I did, I will be going now.
Whoa.
- If I hit a laser do
I still get the 10,000?
- Yes.
Wait, all right.
All right, well Nolan
you won the 10 grand.
There we go.
You didn't even let me explain the level.
The lights actually flicker.
- [Voiceover] Huh?
- All right, go ahead and do
what they were supposed to do,
start flickering them.
- [Nolan] What?
- Yeah, see?
(Nolan laughing)
So if you would've waiting
literally two seconds
you could've got the 10 K
without giving up a life.
Now Nolan's only on one life.
Bye Nolan.
- [Nolan] See ya.
- Nolan, Chris and Karl all have one life.
Chandler you're the
only one with two still.
- Yep, I'm beating everyone.
- [MrBeast] Oh, he's
doing it, he's doing it.
Did he touch it?
- Did I touch it?
- [MrBeast] Karl, he did?
- [Karl] Yeah, he did.
- Oh Chris.
- That is not enough time, I sprinted.
- But you sprinted just to lose a heart.
- Dude, there's no chance
you guys are gonna make that.
- Wait a minute, Chris
this was your last life,
you're out of lives.
- I've been losing so much recently.
- Bye.
- [MrBeast] Now only three people remain.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
He did it, he did it.
- I did it, holy crap.
- Congratulations.
You still have two lives.
- I'm trying to learn the pattern.
- [MrBeast] Oh, no way you just did that,
no way you just did that.
- Yeah baby, yeah!
- [MrBeast] Oh my God.
You literally jumped before it turned off.
- [Karl] Yes I did.
- Oh my gosh, Chandler
you should've saw that.
- [Chandler] What just happened?
- Oh my God.
- This is Chandler's
sister, Nolan's sister,
and Karl's brother.
And we're gonna let them
watch in the corner.
- It's gonna be me guys.
- I don't know about that one.
- Come in to what might be
the last stage of the competition.
We have a balance beam here,
where you must cross without
falling like I just did.
By the way Karl and Nolan
your sister and brother
are on iPads over there.
- [Karl] Hi Sean.
- [Nolan] Hello.
- All right, here we go.
- [MrBeast] All right, Chandler has begun.
- Whoa, why is it so wobbly?
- [Chris] Chandler, Chandler, no, no.
- [MrBeast] Chandler has two
lives, he can afford to fail.
- [Chandler] Just stop wobbling.
- [MrBeast] Oh, this is not looking good.
- [Nolan] No Chandler!
- You can play dead as long as you want,
but I've still gotta rip a heart off.
(heart exploding)
All right, Cassidy he
only has one heart left.
If Karl and Nolan lose here
though Cassidy you win.
Nolan all you gotta do is balance your way
to 100 grand for your sister.
- [Karl] Don't think about
falling Nebraska boy.
- [MrBeast] Oh no.
Oh, oh he did it, he did it.
- Let's go!
You got it, lose.
We going for it.
- All you have to do is just balance,

- [Nolan] Let's go.
- Karl.
I just need to make
sure I strip your heart.
- [Chris] Oof.
- I'll do it for you.
- Just take the shirt off.
All right, yeah bye, goodbye.
- [Sean] I'm so sad.
- Yeah, I would be too.
All right, I'm gonna hang up (laughs).
You each have one heart left,
either your sister or your sister
is winning $100,000 diamond.
- You're going down.
- No, you're going down.
- Let's proceed.
- Natalie, it's down to me and Chandler.
- [Natalie] You got this, I know you do.
- It could be the final round,
we both have one life left.
I'm gonna try my hardest to
win this 100 grand for Cassidy,
hopefully she'll gimme some.
All right.
(Cassidy laughing)
- And now the moment you've
all been waiting for.
Come in gentlemen.
Chandler these are your two stools,
Nolan these are your two stools.
You got have to get to the diamond
using only these two stools.
First to grab it wins
their sister 100 grand.
Think of your sisters.
- I'm thinking.
- [MrBeast] Five,

All right, if you touch
the floor you're out.
Once you get on your stools,
Nolan has started.
I never said you couldn't--
- [Karl] Whoa.
- [MrBeast] Here Nolan.
- [Chandler] I misclicked.
- [MrBeast] No sabotage, I helped him.
That's where they are,
and here's the diamond.
First to touch it keeps it.
- [Karl] Oh Nolan, he's going.
- This is insane, oh my goodness.
- It hurts my knees so bad.
Cassidy, you gotta buy me a new knee cap.
- [MrBeast] Nolan is clearly out in front,
they're closing in on the diamond.
- Yes, I'm gonna win.
- No, you're not.
- [Karl] Oh, oh.
- [Chris] Go Chandler.
Chandler you gotta go fast.
- [Karl] Chandler it's do or die.
It's do or die Chandler.
- [Karl] Chandler go.
- [Nolan] We got it.

- [MrBeast] Nolan congratulations.
- We got it, we got the (indistinct).
You just won not only 100 grand,
but 10,000 on top of it,
we can't stop winning.
- He just won her $110,000.
That was two times in a row
you almost won your sister 100 grand.
(melancholic music)
- Sorry Cassidy, maybe next time.
- It's okay.
- While you're catching your breath
I just wanna say this is actually fake.
That costs like 20 bucks,
the real diamond is in my pocket.
Legit, this is $100,000 diamond.
Here, look at it.
I'm gonna put the real
$99,000 diamond in here,
and then we are gonna
ship it to his sister.
You just won $110,000,
what is going through your mind?
- Honestly, I don't even know what to say.
This is absolutely so freaking crazy,
and I am literally shaking.
You're the best brother I could ever have.
- Yeah, I hope so.
- All right, thank you for watching.

SZQhgExjBvQ,"- I am going to spend the next 24 hours
in this house made 100% of ice.
It's gonna be cold because it's ice.
Ice, ice.
Even the toilet is made of ice.
Oh my goodness, this seat is so cold.
This is gonna be hard,
I don't even have anywhere to sit.
Close the door.
This ice door weighs 600 pounds.
And there we go, the 24 hours begins now.
- I noticed when we were talking to Jimmy,
the ice seemed the little see through.
I wanna test something out.
- [Karl] Oh my God.
- [Chris] Hey Jim Jim, can you see that?
Oh, my butt's wet, ah.
- [Jimmy] Gentlemen, come here.
Do you know why I called this meeting?
- No, we never do.
- If I survive all 24 hours in this ice,
you guys have to cover
yourself in syrup and feathers
and stand on the side of the road.
But if I get out,
I have to cover myself
in syrup and feathers
and stand on the side of the road.
- Can we just not.
- If you want to join my team, come on in.
- No.
- [Chris] No.
- I bought a lot of syrup
and it's not going on me.
That's all, you can go.
- We have to get him out.
- I'm not doing the punishment,
just to be clear, I'm not
gonna do the punishment.
Jimmy, you're getting
out, you're going down.
It's warm in here.
- Jimmy, it's so warm in
here, I bet you're cold.
- [Jimmy] I am very cold.
- We're helping him too much by talking,
the more he talks, the warmer he gets.
I say we stuff it with a tree.
Putting Jimmy in time out.
- [Jimmy] Is this so I can't see you guys?
- [Karl] Yes.
- [Jimmy] Thank you for putting a tree
on top of my front door.
- I think it'll be nice for you.
(audience laughing)
- [Jimmy] My hands are turning
super red from the cold.
Tariq is that you?
- [Tariq] Yeah, what's up dude?
- [Jimmy] Where are the boys?
- [Tariq] They want to get some food.
- [Jimmy] We just started.
- [Tariq] They're always hungry, okay?
- [Jimmy] Ooh, I see you
got some gloves there Tariq.
- [Tariq] Yeah, they're
warm, what do you want?
- [Jimmy] I think it's
pretty obvious what I want.
- [Tariq] All right, you
didn't get 'em from me.
- [Jimmy] Hey, I know I
can always count on you.
Thank you for your gloves.
Hey, hey, I'll give you
10 grand if you help me.
- [Tariq] Oh easy, yes.
- I have a spy now and
the boys have no idea.
Shh.
(mellow music)
It is really cold in here.
This was not a good idea.
Comment down below how much you think
I've spent on this video.
And at the end of the video,
I'll tell you what I've spent.
The results may shock you.
- Dude, Jimmy, there's no chance
Jimmy's gonna last this whole time.
It's practically snowing in here.
- Nah, that's just me man, sorry.
- What are you feeding me for lunch?
- [Karl] There's so much
ice you can eat man.
You can just lick the walls.
- [Jimmy] You see this
statue of Chandler pooping?
- [Karl] Yeah.
Feed me within the next
hour or his head's gone.
- [Chandler] Screw that guy.
Wow.
- Chandler, this is your head.
- [Chandler] Hey buddy.
- [Jimmy] You've been mean to me.
- [Chandler] Wow.
- You know what would be cool?
Pancakes with syrup,
'cause you guys are gonna
be covered in syrup.
- [Chris] Gotcha, okay,
pancakes with syrup.
- That was a joke,
I don't actually want pancakes with syrup.
- You're getting pancakes in syrup.
Hey also Jimmy, I noticed
you're getting cold,
so we bought you a jacket.
There you go.
- For my pinky?
- Your played yourself.
It's no longer cold.
- It still looks cold,
you're surrounded by ice.
- It is freezing,
but at least now my
butt's not wet (chuckles).
Thank you for the jacket (indistinct).
- [Voiceover] Do you like pancakes?
- Oh, Jim jam.
Here are your pancakes
and plenty of syrup.
- Oh, that's good.
(mellow music)
- [Voiceover] Plenty of syrup.
- Oh, this is for me.
- [Chris] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Whoa.
- This one's not covered in syrup.
- Hey, you forgot your fork.
(Jimmy laughing)
- [Chris] Shovel it into your mouth.
Yeah.
(upbeat music)
Ayy, ayy, you're cold.
We're hot.
- I'm not gonna give them the
satisfaction of responding.
Just like in solitary,
if I ignore 'em long
enough they just get bored.
I've noticed they can only be
really stupid for about 10 minutes,
and then they get tired of it.
(upbeat music)
I have no idea how long I've been in here,
but the cold is definitely
starting to get to me.
I just feel cold,
I don't know how else to put it.
This is definitely one of the
harder challenges I've done.
Goodness.
My snot keeps dripping into my mouth.
- Disgusting.
- Why do I do these things?
Can you get me something spicy?
I wanna see if that heats me up.
- [Karl] Okay.
- I don't know if that's how it works,
but it's worth the try.
(upbeat music)
If you join me now you
don't have to get punished,
but after this point you're done.
- There's no chance.
- I'm not gonna reveal anything,
but say we had a good
idea for some content
and everybody thinks it's funny
but it's a little expensive,
but we don't wanna spoil it.
Can we get an approval?
- How much does it cost?
- Under 10 grand.
- Ah, why not?
- All good.
- All right.
- Yeah, woo.
- Sitting down time lapse.
(upbeat music)
This is a toilet made 100% out of ice,
and I kind of have to pee.
You know where I'm going with this,
I'll show you the results.
(upbeat music)
To be honest,
it didn't really melt
like I thought it would.
Who would've thought an ice
toilet would work so well?
I'm sorry for showing you this, I'm bored.
By this point, it was
really starting to set in
how hard the rest of
the challenge would be.
I was frigid and there was no
one around to keep me company,
it was brutal.
- [Karl] Jimmy, guess what?
- [Chris] You're halfway through, yay.
What you did all day,
you just have to do that again.
- [Karl] But now without sleep.
- I am incredibly freezing
and I don't feel like moving.
So the next 15 seconds of the video
you two have freedom to
do whatever you want.
- Jimmy told us we can use 15 seconds
for whatever we wanted.
He gave away both Chris' and my car,
so we decided to give his away.
We gave it to the audio guy
that you're seeing right now,
look at him so excited.
And that's our 15 seconds.
(upbeat music)
- Update, it's so cold I can't even
hold my own camera anymore.
Tariq is now holding my camera for me,
and Brady is filming Tariq filming me.
And Tyler is filming Brady
filming Tariq filming me.
And no one was actually filming me
when I said that last line, lovely.
I know it's hard to tell
but it was extremely late at this point.
And this was literally the coldest
I've ever been in my entire life.
I was miserable.
Remember that question
I asked you earlier?
Well, the answer is this video cost me
around $300,000 to make.
For the price it took
to build this ice house,
I could have bought a real house.
I really hope you enjoy my suffering,
it was expensive.
- [Karl] I hope it's gonna fall forward,
I hope it's gonna fall towards us.
Oh, maybe just one, maybe one.
- I see you have sledgehammers?
- [Chris] Yeah.
(group groaning in disgust)
- It smells like pee.
- It does smell like pee in here.
All right boys, thank you for coming.
- [Karl] By tomorrow we're
gonna have a flame thrower,
goodbye.
- [Chris] Yeah, we're
gonna get a flame thrower.
- Goodnight.
- [Jimmy] Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Jimmy.
- 44, 45, 46, 47, 48.
If you're wondering why
I'm counting out loud,
I don't know.
Sometimes when you're suffering
you do weird things to pass the time.
Fun story, I have to pee, but
Chris destroyed my toilet.
And I don't know about you guys,
but it's currently 4:00 a.m.
which means I have to pee pee.
I got that 4:00 a.m. pee in me right now,
and if I don't get this out
soon I'm gonna pee my pants.
My options are pee on broken PewDiePie,
headless Chandler, or the bed.
PewDiePie it is.
- I am disgusted by this content.
- I was in so much pain at this point
that I had to have a medic come by
and check my temperature every 30 minutes
to make sure something
bad didn't happen to me.
Luckily, my spy came
through with a blanket
and some chicken nuggets.
- Hey, good morning.
- Hey.
- We just woke up and we overslept,
so there's only two hours
left in the challenge.
Okay, let's go get Jimmy out.
You catch any Zs?
- A little bit, yeah.
Not gonna lie, whoever
gave me this blanket
really helped me pull through.
- [Chandler] We're gonna try
and melt a hold in Jimmy's ice.
- [Jimmy] What?
- [Chandler] Oh Jimmy.
- [Jimmy] I just want you to know
68 more minutes until I get out.
- We're gonna break through.
- [Jimmy] Why, what's the point?
- Hey, what's the point?
Looks like this is the point right here.
- Are you sure about that?
- And you still not getting out?
- [Jimmy] Nope.
- I don't know what else to do.
- I have a proposition,
let's see how much Tyler likes you guys.
- Ooh.
- I already know he hates us.
- Tyler, I will play you in a
game of rock, paper scissors.
And if you win one of these three boys
doesn't have to get syruped.
But if you lose you have to join them.
- Yes, I'll do it right now actually.
- We're doing one and done,
I'm going going scissors which
means you're gonna go rock.
Which means I'm gonna go paper,
which means you're gonna go scissors,
which means I'm gonna go rock.
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.
Rock, paper, scissor, shoot.
(group yelling)
- [Tyler] Let's go.
- I still have to do
the challenge for sure.
- All or nothing?
I'll just take everyone.
- I'm down to do double or nothing.
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.
(Tyler grunting)
All right, well, now Chandler
has to get feathered again.
- Wait, I do too?
- It was everybody double or nothing?
- Yes.
- Oh, I didn't know that.
- That's what nothing means.
- All right, I got what I wanted,
now four people get syruped and feathered.
Now that we established that
I'm going back to my hole.
- We're in the final stretch,
it's definitely been
probably the hardest thing
I've ever done in my entire life.
Minus maybe counting to
100,000, that was pretty hard.
These last few hours
were the hardest by far.
I'm so close to being done,
but every part of my body
wants to get out now.
Is that a bathtub?
- [Karl] A hot tub, get in the hot tub.
- [Jimmy] Shut up.
- [Karl] Get in the hot tub.
- Argh.
Are you guys about to get in it?
- [Karl] Yeah.
- Oh, that does sound nice.
- [Cameraman] It looks really steamy.
- It does, I'm getting jealous.
I hate it in here.
(upbeat music)
I was just informed I have
under 10 minutes left.
And to celebrate,
Karl I think we should hit
them with the yeehaw on three.
One, two, three.
- Yee.
- I didn't think you would do it,
I'm gonna do mine delay.
Yeehaw.
- Yeehaw.
- Thank you.
Is it 10:00 a.m. yet?
- Yeah.
- Has it been 24 hours yet?
- [Karl] Yes, yes.
- It is officially.
- Oh, is it?
- Been 24 hours?
- [Jimmy] It's 10:00 a.m?
- [Chris] It's 10:00 a.m.
- [Jimmy] Did he change his phone?
Let me see yours.
- [Cameraman] He did buy a new phone.
- [Karl] Why are you so skeptical?
Boo.
- I survived 24 hours in this--
- Hand warmers.
- Stupid building.
Let's go become birds.
And we're now on the side of the road
with real people driving by.
- Are you ready?
- Oh no.
Oh.
- [Karl] It's thick.
- To be fair, sitting in
that ice chamber for 24 hours
was a lot worse than this.
All right, now you gotta feather up.
- Is this what you guys wanted to watch?
- [Jimmy] Let's see what people think.
- Look at the chicken.
- We're chickens here.
- Now my friends are
chickens the video's over.
Subscribe, see you in the next one.

(loud explosion)"
IoZri9hq7z4,"- I am going to Uber people,
but at the end of the ride,
let them keep the car.
We literally have a Lamborghini,
and I'm going to give it away.
You want to watch this video.
I'm about to turn on Uber
and whoever we pick up first
is literally getting a free car.
I better get five stars.
- Ooh.
- Two minutes away.
Get out, get out, get out.
- To the van.
We are watching Jimmy on the big screen.
We got a surveillance bus,
- And we're gonna watch
him give away a car.
- Low-key, I'm freaking out a bit.
I see the guy waiting on the corner,
and I don't think he
realizes I'm over here.
Please don't cancel the ride.
I'm trying to give you a car.
Bryce? Right here.
- Hook, line and sinker. We got Bryce.
- How's it going?
- Good, how are you?
- This is actually my
first ever Uber ride.
- I wonder if this guy's noticed
just this massive black van
10 feet behind him this whole time.
- I've missed a turn like four times.
- Is this really your first trip?
- Yeah, no, this is
literally the first time
I've ever Ubered anyone.
If you had to choose,
who would you say your
favorite YouTubers are?
- I don't know.
It's pretty, there's a
lot, you know what I mean?
- Yeah. I know there are,
there are quite a bit.
Have you ever made videos?
- One day maybe.
- Hey, you should go for it.
- Jimmy literally doesn't know
how to talk about anything
other than YouTube.
- Figured out who you remind me of.
- Who?
- It's a little hard with
the mask but, Mr. Beast?
- Oh no, the kid knows.
- Yes, I am Mr. Beast.
Can you give me five stars?
- He said, make sure you rate five stars.
- Well then, here, you can have the car
- Actually?
- Yeah.
- Like, for real?
- Yeah. Are you crying?
- Nah. Nah, I'm good.
My car broke down recently, so ...
- All right. Well, perfect timing.
So, here, come hop in the front seat.
Hey, there's the squad.
- Congrats!
- You like it?
- Yeah, I love it, bro.
- Well, if have you
didn't believe it before,
now you have five cameras pointed at you,
so you probably do now.
Congratulations, Bryce,
on your brand new car.
- Thank you so much.
- I'm gonna go hop in the black
van and give away more cars.
Since my first passenger recognized me,
I decided to get a disguise.
I'm gonna head to pick
up my next passenger.
Hopefully they don't recognize me.
Hey, are you Ed?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, hop on in.
How are you guys doing?
- Good.
- Good.
- I like your mustache.
- Thank you.
Sorry, I'm new to Uber.
This is actually literally my third drive.
- How you liking it?
- Good. So far I've made 20 bucks.
- Hey, that's, a bag is a bag.
A bag is a bag.
- Jimmy, you have to figure out
which one of these people's
getting a car, dude.
- Oh, we went to the Salvation Army.
Not the, the Goodwill store.
- Oh.
- Oh.
- It should be right up here.
So you didn't mean to put this address in?
- No, I did mean to put this address in,
I think it messed up.
So you guys gotta drive somewhere else?
- Yeah. So I'm just
gonna call another Uber.
- No, no, that's fine here.
Actually, how about you
guys just take the car
where you need to go?
- Are you serious?
- You guys got it.
Don't worry about it.
All right. Have a nice day.
- All right.
- I literally gave them the keys,
and just walked away.
They were so confused.
What's up, boys?
We actually have a problem,
because I'm doing a video
where I Uber people,
let them keep the car.
But there's three of you.
What should we have them
do to compete for the car?
- The only thing I can
really think of is a race.
Yeah, he's gonna dust us.
- Oh, is he?
You run track?
- Yeah.
- Oh, gosh.
Gentlemen, you are about to
race for this car right here.
Dead serious.
Whoever touches that wooden box
and then this car first, gets to keep it.
- 3, 2, 1, go.
- All right.
Oh, he got a head start.
Oh my gosh. Oh, he's break away,
Oh my gosh. He's break away.
Oh no.
- Gimme the Sentra,
gimme the Sentra.
- There you go.
Congratulations on your brand new car.
- Yo, thank you.
- No problem, man.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
I appreciate it.
That's so exciting, man.
Thank you guys so much.
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
- All right, we're gonna
go give away more cars.
- What do I do with this one?
- You just drive it. It's yours.
- I'm with that. I'm with that.
This just makes it so much
easier for me and my parents.
I'm honestly, probably about
just give this to my mom
'cause she deserves it for sure.
This is definitely gonna help a lot.
- Carl's about to do his
first ride as an Uber driver.
Are you excited?
- No, I just got one. I just got one.
- Oh, really?
- On a scale of 1 to 10,
Carl, how nervous are you?
- 27.
- Carl, it's not that bad.
You're just gonna pick up a random person.
We're just gonna have
you do a bunch of cringey
and embarrassing things in
front of 20 million viewers.
- Okay.
- If he asks why you
have so many lights on,
tell him it's because
you're afraid of the dark.
- Hello? I'm Carl.
- Hey, no problem, man.
- We've all been there.
- I was trying to get into that
man's car when he pulled up.
- Oh, no.
- Carl now has the passenger in his car.
Things are about to get fun.
Every time you pass a light,
I want you to bark and punch the roof.
Carl, you're at a light
- Bark.
- I'll let that one slide this time.
But next time I want a better bark.
- Bark.
- There we go, there we go.
Imagine being that guy in the back seat,
just how awkward it must be right now.
I hate to do this to you
buddy, but I need a hee-haa.
- Hee-haa.
- (indistinct) crazy.
- Hee-haa!
- Oh my gosh, Carl just hee-haa'd.
- Carl, on a scale of 1 to 10,
how much do you hate me right now?
- Yeah, about a 10.
- I would feel bad, but
we're giving the man a car,
- Yeah.
- so it's fine.
When you get to the destination,
tell the guy that you liked him so much
that you're giving him your car.
Clap if you heard that.
Now it's time for the big moment, Carl,
give away the car.
- Here we go.
- You've been my favorite
passenger so much.
You just keep the car,
obviously I'm bad at Ubering.
- Yo, you got me home. You're good.
- I do wanna keep the lights, okay?
- I'm pretty sure you --
- You can keep the lights actually.
This whole thing has been
for a video, I promise.
I'm not weird.
- We run a channel named Mr. Beast,
and we like to give away stuff, and so,
- Are you serious, dude?
- Oh, yeah.
It's your car now.
- Get outta here!
I just, I'm speechless
to be honest with you.
Thanks for freaking me
out and weirding me out.
I guess it was worth the car.
- So you would say tonight's
one of the best nights of your life?
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Awesome. Let's go give away more cars.
I can't believe later in this video,
we're gonna Uber someone
with the Lamborghini
and give it away.
Imagine you called an Uber,
and then they gave you a Lamborghini.
What we just did to
Carl was pretty brutal.
And now it's Chandler's turn.
- No.
- Don't punch me.
- Payback's gonna be sweet.
- Hey, Michael, is that you?
All right. Cool.
- Chandler now has his
passenger in the car.
Wait, wait.
We're at light, you gotta
punch the roof and meow.
- We're at a light. You gotta do it.
- Meow.
- Chandler, you're about
to go pasta the light.
- Meow.
- This is literally better
than any TV show in my entire life.
- Meow.
- What is that, though?
- What is what?
- When you do like that?
- All right, Chandler. Are
you ready to give away a car?
- Thanks. I appreciate it.
- You can stop right here.
- All right.
By the way, man, I don't want this car.
Do you want it?
No, no, no, ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-chill.
I'm cool.
Wait? So you're not an Uber driver?
- Well, yeah, just for that one.
I'll probably quit now.
- We're filming up a video
where we're Ubering random
people giving them a car.
And since we just Ubered
you, you get to keep the car.
- Are you serious?
You giving me a free car right now?
- The whole time telling
me what to say, dude.
I'm so sorry.
- No, it's cool bro. It's cool, bro.
- Yeah, it's cool because
you just got a brand new car.
- I'm blessed.
Like, man, you don't even
know. I walk to work.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- If anybody deserves this, this is him.
My God.
- This is the best day of my life.
I'm overwhelmed with joy.
- Oh my goodness.
- Thank you.
- I'm so happy.
- Thank you so much.
- So far, we've Ubered
five different people
and we've made $59.94 so far.
Some people drive for
Uber as a full-time job.
And after you pay for gas and everything
this would be pretty hard to live off of.
So I'm gonna tip an Uber driver, a car.
Confirm pickup.
Our Uber driver is 18 minutes away.
- Oh.
- Oh, I think this is him.
- How's it going?
We're actually filming a video,
and we wanted to give you something.
Basically, today was my first day Ubering
and I realized just how hard it is,
so I wanted to give you a present.
I want to give you this car for free.
- Oh, come on, man.
Don't make a joke.
- No, it's not a joke.
That's your brand new car.
- Are you sure?
- Like I said, I've been
Uber driving all day,
and it's a lot of work, dude.
- I really appreciate it, man.
I really have to,
I don't know how can I express
my feeling towards this.
- Congrats on the brand new car.
I'll see you guys tomorrow.
Do you know why I crammed
you guys in this car?
- Nope.
- It's because Tyler
cracked the windshield.
Oh, what are you doing?
Which means we should punish him.
I had Carl go to the party store
and pick out the weirdest
costumes he could find.
Hand me more stuff.
Put on this wig.
Now that you have your disguise on,
we're gonna go to the van and torture you.
Tyler, we are now in the van.
Are you ready? You look ridiculous.
- I would never get in
a car if I saw this.
Oh crap.
Did you actually just mess up another car?
- I'm actually shaking.
Oh, got a guy. I got a guy.
- Go, go.
- I just saw myself in the mirror.
I look so creepy.
You Michael?
- Yes, sir.
- Sweet. I'm your Uber, man.
How you doing, man?
- All right. How you doing?
- Who wants to kick us off?
All right.
- Do you like bananas?
- Do you like bananas?
- Yeah. I like bananas.
- Look at Tyler's face, he's glistening.
- Get through the green light, and go,
""Boom, Shakka, Lakka,
green light. Let's go.""
- Boom, Shakka, Lakka,
green light. Let's go.
- How about another boom
shakka lakka at the next light?
- Boom, Shakka, Lakka, Let's go.
Another green light.
- I love what he looks
up and he's just like,
- Huh?
- All right before you go,
real quick, real quick.
I have these keys
and I kind of want to
just give 'em to you.
- Man, you acting crazy.
- No, no, I'm not acting crazy.
- Spill the beans, Tyler.
Tell him it's a show.
- All right. I'll be honest with you.
Yeah, it's actually a YouTube channel.
That's Jimmy.
That's Chan Chan.
- What's up, Jimmy?
- Not much.
So have you ever seen the
channel Mr. Beast before?
- No. I ain't never seen Mr. Beast.
- We're filming a video
where we Uber random people,
let them keep the car.
- What?
- And since we just Ubered you,
you get to keep the car.
Oops.
- You lie, man.
- No, that's your car. I'm serious.
- This is crazy, bro.
I got a new car, man.
- Yeah. This is all you.
We'll give you $1,000
to fix the windshield.
That was not on purpose.
- The best day of my life, man.
Besides me getting married.
I can't say that, you know, but,
- Aw.
- Man, Mr. Beast,
y'all the best, man.
- Aw.
- I really wanna appreciate, y'all.
I really wanna thank y'all, man
- Because of you guys watching the videos
we're able to help people like him
and I'm glad you like the car.
- That was the most awkward thing
I've ever done in my life.
We've given away a lot of
cars today, wouldn't you say?
- Yes. I would say.
- Well, we have this Lamborghini
and we will Uber someone random
and let them keep the Lamborghini.
- That's insane.
- But before we do that,
we gotta give away these three cars
and whoever gives away their car first,
I will give their mom $10,000.
Go!
- Get out the way, Carl.
- Oh gosh.
- Oh wow.
- Let me get my seatbelt on.
Did they even put their seat belts on?
- Mom, you're about to win $10,000.
- I took a bunch of Jimmy's Apple products
that I'm going give these people.
- Hold on, hold on.
Sir, do you want a car?
You want this car?
- Oh my God.
Is he about to already give it away?
- It's literally a free car.
- He's a psycho, don't listen to him!
- Literally take it.
I swear on my life, just --
- No, no, hey take our car.
- It's just free.
All right, give up on it.
He doesn't want the car.
- You want a free car?
We're giving away a free car.
I promise.
All right, well.
- I'm at literally some
intersection right now.
It's a free car.
That car, it's free. I promise you.
- I'm trying to give away a car.
If you guys need proof that
I'm gonna give you guys stuff.
Here's an iPad.
You're gonna pass?
- Yeah.
- Oh no.
Okay. Come on, please.
- I have a free car.
It's free.
I know you don't believe me.
Do you know who Mr. Beast is?
- Sir? Do you want a free car?
You don't want a free car?
All right.
- It's free.
It's literally free.
Just stop.
- I'm trying to give away a
car faster than my friends.
- I'm all right.
- You're all right?
- Yeah.
- I just don't understand.
Hi. No?
Oh!
- Please, you want it? You want it?
- Yeah.
- It's all yours.
It's all yours. It's all yours.
I don't know how to be weird about it.
I got it, I got it.
I gave one away.
- But Tyler, you've
already given away a car?
- Yeah. 20 seconds ago.
- Chandler hasn't given away one yet.
Neither has Carl.
- Let's go.
My mom is out of a job.
She's gonna be so happy.
Mom, you just won $10,000
thanks to this gentleman right here.
- Glad I could help you win 10,000.
- The moment you've all been waiting for.
I'm giving away this Lamborghini.
And I'm gonna start
looking for passengers now.
Go.
- A few moments later.
- Oh, we gotta hit.
- All right, we got a hit.
- Our passenger's a live show.
Let's do this.
Can't believe I'm about
to give this Lamborghini
to someone who called an Uber.
- Free Lambo, free Lambo.
- It's honestly terrifying
driving this car.
It is so fast.
- This is like watching a
YouTube video, but live.
- Hey, did you call the Uber?
Hop on in.
Where are we going?
- To my job.
- Okay. Where do you work?
Hey, what?
Why are you driving this in an Uber?
- I don't, actually, put your seatbelt on.
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
- Okay, let's start it.
- How old are you?
- I'm 22.
- You're only 22?
- Yep. I do this on
the side to make money.
- This is like kind of surreal, man.
- Just riding in a Lamborghini?
- Yeah.
- Well, sir,
if you owned a Lamborghini,
how would that make you feel?
- Definitely wouldn't drive Uber.
- I'll go ahead and spill the beans.
Have you ever seen the channel Mr. Beast?
- I knew it, dude.
I just watched your video yesterday
that you put out you gave
your 40 million subscribers,
- 40 cars. Well, I guess you
can see where this is going.
- Oh my God.
- When I drop you off,
this will actually officially
be your Lamborghini.
- Are you serious?
You're, you're lying.
- Nope.
- No way, man.
- I was supposed to wait
till the end of the ride,
but seeing you freak out,
I didn't even wanna wait.
How tall are you?
- I'm very short. I'm 5'8"".
- Perfect.
- Jimmy told him so early,
that now he's like gotta
sit there in the car
and just wait to win it.
- There's a lot of accidents up here, man.
So be careful with my car, all right.
- Okay.
- Oh my goodness.
- Dude, this is insane.
There's the squad.
There's the camera.
Like I said, this is your Lamborghini.
Let me open the door for you, sir.
- Holy crap.
- It's all you, man.
- Can I turn it on?
- Yeah.
Oh my gosh.
- Oh!
- Dude, this is the craziest thing
that's ever happened to me in my life.
- Hit that subscribe button.
Thank you for watching.
Congratulations, Elijah.
We'll see you in the next video.
- Yeah!"
vp5sSqyZ5Go,"- Today, we are filling my brother's house
with elephant toothpaste.
And then we're gonna surprise
him with a brand new house.
And you might be wondering why,
well, I caught wind that my brother
is covering Karl's
house with sticky notes.
And I thought it'd be
funny if while he did that
we filled his house with
elephant toothpaste.
Prank inception.
If you take this and pour it in this
you get elephant toothpaste.
That is insane.
Look at it, that was hardly any.
And if you take a thousand times that...
(dramatic music)
Oh my goodness.
Oh my goodness.
You get this.
And what you just saw is
nothing compared to what
we're gonna do to my brother's house.
- Dude, it might blow the roof off.
- There's enough in these
barrels to fill five houses.
And my brother only has one,
so we'll use a little less.
And because we have so
much elephant toothpaste
I had to bring in an expert.
- That's me.
- [MrBeast] Do you mind moving Karl?
- I'm the expert.
- Oh my goodness.
Mark literally holds two world records
with elephant toothpaste,
and has done multiple videos on it.
And this is my brother's house.
Welcome in everybody.
This is Frank's room,
his roommate we're not
gonna mess with that.
- We are gonna mess with this.
- Yes, we are gonna mess with this room.
- Is that underwear on the fan?
Oh, what the heck?
Can you go outside real
quick and go grab Chris?
Listen, Karl has no idea his house
is currently being sticky noted.
And CJ thinks he's pranking Karl,
but CJ's actually getting pranked.
It's a lot to keep up with.
As I keep saying,
we will fill this entire house
with elephant toothpaste.
But first we wanna test
things in the bathroom.
Let's do it.
- [Mark] You just pull.
- [MrBeast] Pulling it.
Oh God.
- [Karl] Oh, I think so, oh I think so.
Oh.
It's steaming.
- [Mark] Oh my God.
- And I turned around
and I felt a wave of heat
just engorf me.
- I'm so glad that you turned around,
cause I turned around when you did.
- You guys violated the safety protocol.
- Well, what was the safety protocol?
- Get far away.
- When we actually fill his house
I am going to be 30 houses away this time.
Oh my gosh.
- Oh, look at the ceiling.
Oh my goodness.
- And we're gonna do this
to his entire house when he comes home.
Not gonna lie,
I've never been so scared
of foam in my entire life.
Now that we got that out the way,
I gotta go check in on CJ.
I need to check his progress
on sticky noting Brady's house.
Pause, you might be
confused why I just said
Brady's house is getting
covered in sticky notes,
when it's obviously Karl's house.
Well to not spoil my brother's video
we couldn't tell Karl his
house was being sticky noted.
So Karl thinks we're covering
Brady's house with sticky notes.
Mark, I'm putting you
in charge of the boys,
I'm gonna go check on CJ.
- I'll do my best.
- All right, my brother has
no idea we're parked here.
And he's currently filming
a video where he's gonna
cover Karl's entire
house with sticky notes.
I can hear them talking inside.
Dude, can you grab CJ's footage,
and see what they're talking about.
- The sticky notes keep falling down,
and I'm running out of sticky notes.
I need you to grab some more.
- Got it, I'll get you some sticky notes.
All right Jake, here you go.
(sticky notes clattering)
- Thanks CJ.
Appreciate it.
- Let's get out of here
before our cover is blown,
they're sticky noting the inside.
And they're saving this
part, the outside, for last.
All right, let's go.
- [Chris] Let's do it.
Go, go, go.
(upbeat music)
it broke the TV.
- I leave you guys alone for two minutes.
- [Chris] It's your
fault, you left us alone,
we need supervision at all times.
(upbeat music)
(group exclaiming)
- It's gonna be 20
times the amount of foam
that you just saw in this room alone.
- I'm an expert, don't try this at home.
- [Chris] Eurgh, that
didn't look worth it.
That just didn't look worth it.
Go!
- [Karl] (screams) Oh, I'm stuck.
- [MrBeast] Mark, what is this?
- It's Mark's fault, he left us alone.
- I just got back from scouting
out the sticky noted house.
According to my calculations,
he should be done sticky
noting in under an hour.
And when he pulls in that
driveway, what do we want?
- Foam.
- We want his house
to erupt in foam.
Right when CJ pulls into his driveway
we're gonna unleash all the elephant foam.
It is literally gonna blow every door
and every window out of
this house for a mile.
I need four barrels in this room,
four barrels in his room,
four barrels in that room.
And put the other barrels
wherever else they fit.
- Woo.
- This is insane, just big,
and crazy, and chaotic.
Windows will be blown out.
- One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine.
10, 11, 12, 13, 14 drums
of elephant toothpaste.
And let me remind you,
this is what one drum
looked like on its own.
And we have 14 of these.
- I washed my hands of this, all right?
- If things go bad it's all my fault.
- Thank you.
- Because I trusted Mark.
What is the current elephant
toothpaste world record?
About 290 gallons of hydrogen peroxide.
- Okay, and we are using 500 today.
- Yeah, you guys are.
- We are almost doubling
the current world record
for elephant toothpaste in CJ's house.
- That's right.
- The world record
toothpaste is almost ready.
The second you get a phone call from me
don't even answer it, let it rip.
- Okay.
- Let it rip.
I will call you when we are ready.
All right, let's go
check out Brady's house.
Brady lives on the other side
of your neighborhood Karl.
So we're coming up on
your house, right Karl?
- [Voiceover] Oh no.
- Yeah, we are.
I wonder why.
Wait, why am I so dumb?
What the hog?
- [MrBeast] So this whole video.
- Oh my God.
- [MrBeast] The plan has always been
to sticky note your house,
and we were using Brady as a cover up.
- Why did I not even see that coming?
I really genuinely didn't see that coming.
- [CJ] Karl.
- I hate you, both brothers,
I hate both brothers now.
- [MrBeast] Not only did you
get pranked on our channel,
but you got pranked on his channel.
(door knocking)
- Oh hey.
(group laughing)
- You don't have to let them in, right?
- Yeah.
- You could just keep the door locked.
They promised that they
wouldn't do my room,
and I was like, ""Yeah, that's fine.""
- Wait, they did my room?
That's not even how you spell it,
you didn't even spell it right.
What do you mean, what could I...
Oh.
(group laughing)
Oh my.
- Closet wizard strikes again, what?
- What can you guys all
get out of my house now?
Please.
We should leave now, huh?
That's what I'm thinking about.
I'm thinking about leaving.
- Oh, you're thinking about leaving?
- Yes.
- [Chris] We're about to take
your record, sorry about that.
- Yeah, I think windows will get broken.
- [Chris] Oh, windows will get broken?
- Yeah.
- Oh my goodness.
Sorry if we fill your yard
with slime, we'll fix it.
Is this legal?
- Define legal.
- I think that's a good
enough answer for me.
- Wait, where's your house, huh?
I don't think I've ever
been to your house,
it's right past all those cars.
- Through this road?
- Yeah.
- Well, I just wanna see it,
I've never been to your house before.
- [Brady] You live here?
- Mm-hmm.
- All right, so three, two, one.
- Three, two.
- Oh my gosh,
here it goes.
- One.
Oh my gosh.
- [Mark] Pull.
(suspenseful music)
- [Chris] It's coming out
the chimney, oh my gosh.
- Oh my gosh, it's coming out the chimney.
- What did you guys do to my house?
What did you guys do to my house?
Wait, who let you in the house?
- [MrBeast] Oh you know, Frank.
- Oh my God.
- You spent the day covering Karl's house
with sticky notes to surprise Karl.
And while you were doing that
we were filling your house
with elephant toothpaste
waiting for you to come home.
- [Chris] Oh yeah,
should we throw a rock
through this front window?
- [Brady] Open it, open it.
Oh, run CJ run.
- [Karl] CJ, CJ no.
- Chris, I give you permission
to break my front window.
- Can Mark Rober help?
- Yeah.
- Yes, you can also help.
- Thank you CJ, I love you.
I've always wanted to do this.
(glass smashing)
- Oh, it went through.
Chris do you wanna open this door for us?
- Please and thank you.
- Here we go.
(group exclaiming)
Oh my God, this is literally
real life ""Goosebumps"",
I swear.
- I didn't mean to set you up,
I didn't mean to set you up like that.
- Oh my gosh, that was so hot.
- Oh, it is hot.
- Oh, woo, that's steamy.
- Hey, let me in.
(group exclaiming)
Whoa, whoa.
- Dude, I wanna run
through there so badly.
- How did you guys actually do this?
- Mark Rober.
- Yeah, Mark Rober.
We got your roommate's permission,
we brought down Mark Rober,
and we took everything
important out of the house.
So what are you buying Karl?
Since you sticky noted his house.
(group laughing)
I can't.
- I did leave some money for him.
- Okay, okay, the sticky
notes can easily come off,
but this obviously is a lot more damaging.
Which is why CJ we've bought
you a brand new house.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Really, where's it at?
- This is CJ's brand new house,
come on in, check it out, check it out.
- Oh my goodness,
I still cannot believe
that this is my new house.
(upbeat music)
- Do you like this house?
Because I can get you a different
one if you're not happy.
- No, I actually like this house,
it's actually great.
- And just to clarify,
I have a team working around
the clock to fix his old house.
Don't worry, we're not
gonna screw him over.
I wonder what that means."
AKJfakEsgy0,"(chill music)
- At the time I'm recording this video,
I have 8,000 subscribers
and 1.8 million views.
So whenever you see this,
compare these numbers to whatever I have
when you watch this.
What's up, guys?
It's currently October 4th, 2015.
Yes.
I'm probably like a freaking
grown man when you see this.
I'm still in high school right now.
And whoa, this camera's tilted.
When you see this, I'm
actually going to be in...
I'm not even gonna be in college.
This is gonna be after college.
Wow, dude, this is gonna be crazy.
It's 2015 for me right now.
Dude, what if I'm dead?
Dude, if I'm...
Ooh, that would be weird.
That'd be so weird.
RIP.
Oh, that would, that'd be really weird.
But so let's see.
Dude, if I don't have
a million subscribers
when you see this video, my
entire life has been a failure.
I hope I have a million subs.
I better have a million
subscribers when you guys see this.
(Mr. Beast sighs)
Dude, that'd be...
I don't even know what
college I'm going to.
But by the time you see this,
I'll have finished high
school, gone to college,
probably be doing YouTube
as a job, hopefully.
Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe?
Yeah, I really hope I have
a million subs by now.
Please, future me, please.
What am I doing with my hand?
Please have a million subs.
I probably should have thought
about what I was gonna say.
Just, hey, hopefully
you have a million subs.
And, dude, I wonder if you still,
all right, so I should be
studying for a history test
and I wonder if you remember
what grade I'm gonna get
on this history test that I take tomorrow
that I'm not studying for
because I'm making these videos.
So, I'm probably gonna...
Dude, if you still
remember the grade I get
on this history test, that's crazy.
I better have a million
when this goes public.
Deuces.
I'm not Pewdiepie.
Screw that.
I don't wanna do this over again.
See ya, future me."
Vl3swga-Xrk,"- I'm about to ask
somebody one of the most
ridiculous questions ever.
Would he rather have $100,000
or one of the most rarest
diamonds on the planet.
But the $100,000 on this
cheque will be covered up.
Let's see what he picks.
You are about to make one of
the most important decisions
of your entire life.
- It's true.
- John, would you rather have this
$38,000 diamond ring, dead serious.
Or this mystery cheque
that you can't know what's written on it.
- Come on.
(sighing)
- $38,000 ring or what's behind this tape
on this mystery cheque.
- I gotta go with the ring, dude.
- You're going with the ring?
- I gotta go with the ring
cause that's guaranteed, dude.
- You're going with the ring?
Congratulations. You just made 38 grand.
- Whoa.
- No. Like this is like, actually real?
- It is real. I promise.
I wanna show you what you could have had.
- Oh.
- If you would've picked the cheque,
you would've got $100,000.
But all you gotta is, what's $38,000?
- Darn it.
- That's like nothing.
- Let's head to the next bit.
- Joe, if you guess how many
jelly beans are in this jar,
I will give you $1 million.
(laughing)
- Yeah.
- It's so epic, I bought smoke machines.
- I can't...
- No, you cannot take the lid off.
$1 million is a lot of money.
- It is, it is a lot of money.
- I can't let you collect intel.
10, 9-
- Wait, wait, wait! Can I call
in, can I call in like help?
- 6, 5...
- Can I FaceTime somebody.
- 5, 4, 3...
- Uh, 72,368.
- 72,368.
68.
You know if it ended in
68, we'd put another one
so it ended in 69.
- You would do me that dirty?
- This determines if
you make $1 million show
and if my mom hates me.
- Ah!
(all groaning)
I was so way off.
- 8,171 was the guess.
- You almost got one of the numbers.
- What if I would've guessed it was Jimmy?
- You probably would've won.
- No, he wouldn't have.
(all laughing)
- This is Andre.
Here's some solo cups.
I want you to lay 'em.
(money tinging)
You just made $5.
(chuckling)
Every single red solo cup you lay,
I will give you a dollar.
If you cover the entire floor,
you can start stacking them.
You have the entire room
and unlimited cups and
you have the whole day.
Andre, I'm gonna leave
you to go do your thing.
We're gonna go give away more money.
- Peace out.
- All right. See you in a bit.
(chuckling)
- There's no way that this
is going to be this easy.
- This is going to be
one of my favorite bits.
Seriously, this can
determine whether or not
you win 10 grand.
Pick a number between one and 20.
- 15.
- You picked 15, which
means you get 1-5 swings
of this pickax
Now, you might be wondering,
what do you swing the pickax at?
- Big reveal.
- [MrBeast] It's a
briefcase covered in ice.
We literally took a
briefcase full of 10 grand,
put it in water and froze it.
- What?
- And you have 15 swings
to get to the briefcase.
(ice smashing)
Oh. All right. I think
you pierced the suitcase.
- [Grant] I did, I did.
There's a hole in it.
- Give it your second swing.
- All right.
(ice smashing)
(all cheering)
(rock music)
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
I'm still alive somehow.
(buzzer)
- Oh, picked it. I picked it.
- Well, thanks for coming out.
- [Man] Yeah, man.
- Since Grant couldn't break
into the giant cube of ice,
we have another contestant.
Felix, come on in.
- [Man] Yeah, Felix.
(guys cheering)
- Yeah, Felix.
- If you can break the
briefcase out of the ice,
you get to keep the 10
grand and you get 10 swings.
- [Man] I'm gonna help
you real quick, Felix.
(guy farting) There you go.
- Thank you.
(all cheering)
(ice smashing)
(all cheering)
- Well, you can now
carry it home with him.
(chuckling)
- It's still covered in
ice, but it's not dangling.
If you can carry it out, I'll
let you keep the 10 grand.
Eventually the ice will melt.
- [Felix] I got it. I got it.
- [Man] Oh, cheating!
- [Felix] Bye. Thank you.
Next bit.
(upbeat music)
We made a wall of basketball goals.
And I have a ton of cool prizes.
For every shot the contestants
make, they get an item.
They can shoot as many times as they want
but if they miss, they
lose all their items.
And this challenge is a little different.
We have brothers competing this time.
- Wait, is it a competition?
- Actually, you're working together.
- Oh.
- Oh.
- Which one of you wants to shoot first?
- Me.
- Which means he should
shoot first. Here you go.
(slapping leg)
- Oh.
- Feel free to shoot whenever.
Only 20, 30, $40,000 in
prizes are on the line.
- Yeah.
- [MrBeast] It's fine. Oh...
(all cheering)
All right, he made the shot
which means you get a claim
a prize from this shelf.
So you're choosing the MacBook Pro.
If you miss, he loses his Mac
and the challenge is over.
(suspenseful music)
Oh!
(boys cheering)
So you want an Oculus Rift?
- I, I guess.
- You can risk your MacBook Pro
and his Oculus or you could end it now.
- Okay.
(all laughing)
- Don't mess up.
(buzzer)
- No!
(emotional music)
- [MrBeast] Well...
- Let me show you how easy it is.
(pinging)
Three prizes. You could have done that.
- That's more prizes in one go.
- Now we're going to do the
same thing but with Chandler.
Win as much as you want.
- Let's go! AirPods.
- AirPods?
- AirPods.
- [MrBeast] Do you wanna risk them?
- Yes.
(all cheering)
Let me get the Beats too.
- Yeah!
Hey! Oh...
- Switch.
- Yeah.
Woo!
- iPad.
- Woo!
- Okay.
- I don't miss.
Theragun.
- Chandler, you're risking a lot of stuff.
- [Chandler] I don't miss.
- He don't miss.
- Let me get whatever that is.
- Yeah.
(guys cheering)
- MacBook, Oculus.
- Woo.
- Okay.
Yeah!
- Woo.
(buzzer)
(rock music)
(guys laughing)
- [Chandler] It didn't hit the ground.
- Chandler, you had all this cool stuff
But now who do you think
would win in a race?
Carl or Chris?
I'll give you $10,000 if
you pick the right winner.
And if you pick the loser, you get $0.
- I pick this guy.
- Oh.
- Head on down to the finish line.
We're gonna have them race.
Let's see if you win 10 McFlurries.
- I feel like such a jerk if I win.
- Why? Because then you won't get $10,000?
- Yeah, it'll just get
ripped out of his hand.
- Well, how about this, Carl?
If you win, I'll give you $5,000.
- Oh, I don't mind taking
money from him then.
- So I get to help somebody win money
and take money away from Carl?
- Yes, Chris.
- Yes, I'm in.
- I didn't tell you
this, but if Carl wins,
I'm gonna give him five grand.
- If Carl... why'd you tell me that?
- 3, 2, 1 go.
All right, they're off. They're off.
Oh, Chris looks like he's in the lead.
- Let's go, Chris! Chris!
- Go Carl.
- Chris!
- Oh my God, Carl.
- Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go.
(indistinct chattering)
- Why is he so strong?
Yo, you get a hug too, buddy.
Come on, man. Jump up here.
Come on, man.
- Okay.
- Come on, bro. Come on, bro.
- You're really tall.
- Oh my gosh, Andre.
Holy crap.
This is crazy.
Look how many cups he's laid.
Roughly though, how many cups
do you think you've laid?
- 1000, 1500. I don't know.
- You still have plenty
of time to lay cups.
Make sure you guys watch to the end
so you see how much money he made
and let's go give away more money.
I have a blue bucket, a red
bucket and a yellow bucket.
One bucket is full of mustard.
- Oh, no.
- One bucket is full of slime.
- Oh my God.
- And one bucket is full
to the brim of money.
- Hey, can I get that one?
- Isaiah, I'm gonna let you pick.
Who do you think should be
under the yellow bucket?
- I feel that Chris should
be under the yellow bucket.
- All right.
- Okay.
- Who should be under the red bucket?
You or Carl?
- It's gonna be red for Carl.
- Carl, go under the red bucket.
- Oh yeah.
- Are you sure Isaiah, that
this isn't mustard or slime?
- No, this is the money bucket.
- Chris, what do you think
is in this yellow bucket?
- 10 grand might be coming my way.
- Yeah for sure.
I'm gonna back up.
- Oh, so I can be safe.
- Chris, congratulations
on winning $10,000.
(all laughing)
Oh, I lied about the
$10,000. It was mustard.
- Why is it spicy?
- Well I couldn't make it easy.
(all laughing)
- Carl buddy, it is now your turn.
What do you think is in this bucket?
- I really think it's slime now.
- Why?
- Oh, because I'm next.
And I feel like you wouldn't
do the money in the middle
because we have a bunch
of mustard on the ground.
- Yeah!
(all laughing)
- At least the slime was warm.
- Which means, Isaiah, you won $10,000.
- What?
- I'm just gonna get...
- Group hug.
(guys shrieking)
- It only got on Isaiah.
All right.
(upbeat music)
This is our first ever
relationship challenge
on the MrBeast channel.
- I thought we were the
first relationship challenge.
- This is Matt. This is Elizabeth.
Would you say you guys
know each other very well?
- Oh definitely.
- Absolutely.
- How long have you been together?
- Two years and three months.
- Okay.
I'm gonna split you two up
and put your relationship to the test.
So I'm gonna ask each of you questions
and if you give the same answer,
I'm gonna give you a mystery prize.
- Okay.
- Wow.
- [MrBeast] But, I'm gonna
split you up to make it harder.
Now that you two are separated,
we can get into the fun stuff.
So I hear you want to take it
to the next level with your girlfriend.
- I was planning on
proposing earlier this year
before I lost my job.
And we're just not really
sure how to move forward.
- If you and Elizabeth
give the exact same answers
to all questions, I'll give you $15,000
to put towards your wedding.
- Wow. That would be life changing.
- Let's begin.
Carl, ask the first question.
- Where was your guys first date?
- Town Common.
- Okay.
- Town Common.
You stay here.
We're gonna go see if she
gives the same answer.
And of course we're not gonna
tell her what the prize is.
- Where was your first date with him?
- At Town Commons.
- Really?
- All right.
All right. You both gave the same answer
for the first question.
We'll be right back.
She gave the same answer.
- Figured she would.
- It's almost like you both
went on the same first date.
Chris, I'm gonna take his
$15,000 for his wedding
and put it in your hands.
- What is your significant
other's middle name?
- Cerelle.
- Cerelle, okay.
- What's your middle name?
- Cerelle.
- That's correct.
- He said the same thing.
How serious are you
about proposing to her?
- I will do it right now.
- Okay, we talked a little bit off camera
and he was telling me that
he wanted to propose to her on camera.
And I just wanna let you
know, it's 100% your decision.
Do you want to?
- Absolutely.
- Well then if that's the case,
the final question is you
asking her, ""Will you marry me?""
- Okay.
- Before we do it, can
you show us the ring?
- Yeah.
- Oh my gosh.
- Ooh.
- [Carl] Oh my gosh.
- This is going to be the final question
for the mystery prize.
This is for all the marbles,
all the enchiladas, all the...
- Marbles again.
- Now turn around and face each other.
(Elizabeth crying)
I didn't think this through too well.
(nervous chuckling)
Oh.
- Elizabeth, will you marry me?
(pinging)
(guys cheering)
- Oh my God.
- The mystery prize was actually
$15,000 towards your wedding.
- Wow.
- Oh wow. Thank you.
(guys cheering)
- Hug, you guys-
(guys cheering)
- Can have pizza at the reception.
(lively music)
- We should all hug.
- Yeah, why don't you
guys hug me like that.
- You guys wanna get married?
(cups popping)
(cups falling)
- [Andre] No!
(theatrically crying)
- The next giveaway is two
cars and this one is real
but this car right here
is made outta ramen.
I'm giving you the option
to pick which car you want.
- I see rims.
That looks disconjumbled a little bit.
- Disconjumbled?
- You're picking this car?
- Okay. Reveal the car she could have had.
- All right.
- A Mini Coop.
- Please reveal to her the car she chose.
- All right, you ready?
(guys laughing)
- So really did that.
- Chandler, I'm gonna let you take over.
I got, I got a phone call I gotta take
- [Woman] Gorgeous.
(cups popping)
- Andre, oh my gosh.
This looks insane.
- [Andre] Wild, huh?
- [MrBeast] Look at this.
They just never end.
You laid these all by yourself?
- [Andre] I did it all by my lonesome.
Very, very solo.
- So genuinely, how many
cups do you think you laid?
- Um, I could say about 3,500, 36.
- Well, according to
my people that counted
all the cups that entered
this room, you laid 4,700.
So we're gonna round up to 5,000.
- I like that number.
Thank you very much.
- And now that you made all that money.
- Yeah.
- You wanna have some fun?
- Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I?
- Go for it.
(rock music)
(cups falling)
- I just won $5,000 on MrBeast.

UE5AHE2Ypr8,"- Today, I'm going to be giving
my 40 millionth subscriber
all 40 of these cars.
We have a Porsche, a Chrysler,
a Tesla with a custom 40 mil wrap on it,
and even a SpongeBob car.
- I picked this one myself.
- YouTube gives you a list of
your most recent subscribers.
And when I hit 40 million,
I refreshed the list,
and I messaged the newest one.
And all I told him is that
I have a surprise for him.
He has no idea we're giving him 40 cars.
Guys, stop jumping on the cars.
- Imagine getting 40 cars.
How much did you spend?
- How much do you think?
- 300,000.
- More.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- 500?
- I don't wanna tell you.
All right boys, load 'em up.
(rock music)
Now all 40 cars are
loaded up on car haulers,
because my 40 millionth
subscriber is 10 hours away,
and obviously I don't
feel like driving 10 hours
40 different times.
That'd be stupid.
Let's go.
(rock music)
After 10 hours of driving,
we're finally here.
Let's give away some cars.
I'm terrified.
Karl, you knock.
(Karl knocking)
(explosion)
Hey, are you Luke?
- What's up?
- Did you actually think we'd come?
- Nah, not really. Nah.
- Okay. Well, I need you
to put this blindfold on.
Your prize is huge,
it's gonna take us forever to set it up.
Tareq, come over here.
First off,
I have no idea what room I'm in.
I literally just walked in a random room.
Second, there's 40 cars down
the road and he has no idea.
We're gonna walk him out
blindfolded and then surprise him.
I am so excited.
- I can't believe we're about to unload
all of these cars into his lawn.
This is insane.
This is the first of 40 cars.
Go ahead, offload it.
Karl. I don't think he notices you.
- He can see me.
- That's not productive.
1 out of 40.
And the next car,
come on down.
Let's do this.
This car actually looks really nice.
Can I be my 40 millionth subscriber?
Wait, does this mean it's manual?
All right, next car.
- We've never done
anything like this before.
This is ridiculous.
(rock music)
- Do you remember where
Jimmy said to put this?
- No, here's good.
- All right.
You were our 40 millionth subscriber,
and because of that,
take off your blindfold.
We brought you 40 cars.
- [Luke] Whoa, dude, dude. No way.
- Obviously you don't
need 40 cars, correct?
- No way.
- Which is why I have a challenge for you.
If you give away all 40 of
them and under 24 hours,
you get this custom wrapped Tesla.
But the last nine cars are covered,
and let's just say, Luke's gonna
struggle to give them away.
Don't think the challenge is over yet,
it's gonna get really hard.
- I'm a good salesman though.
- Okay.
- Well hey.
- But that's at the end.
Let's give away the unwrapped cars first.
See the timer there?
All right, let's do this.
- I'm going my brother, Jake right here.
- You wanna go grab him?
- Got a surprise for you,
bud. This one right here,
that's yours.
- No way.
(engine revs)
Hey, man, hey,
we can do this all day,
but I got 39 more of these.
- [Mr Beast] That is car
number one of 40 gone.
Do you have another brother?
- Well, I have a little
brother. He's like 10.
- I mean there's no rule that
says you can't give a car
to a 10 year old.
Ben, can you drive?
- Maybe
- Legally?
- No
- We're gonna have Luke
drive it off the lot for you.
These are your parents?
So if he gives away all 40 of these cars,
I don't care who it is,
he could give them to a
random person at Walmart,
he gets that Tesla.
So he wants to give you guys one,
so just walk through and pick one.
- I always like the Grand Cherokee.
- Its yours, Dad.
What are your thoughts on this?
- I love it.
- Think I can have this Porsche?
- Go for it.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Thank you so much, Luke.
(engine revs)
- Luke is currently
texting all his friends
to come and get a car.
Imagine someone in your high school class
just sends you a text saying,
""Hey, I have a car to give away.""
Would you actually believe your friend?
- No.
- All right, so this
is your friend, Carson?
- Got a lot of cars here.
Gotta get them all gone,
and I get that Tesla.
- There's so many cars you can pick from.
- Jimmy, he wants the Subaru,
let the man get a Subaru.
- Yeah, this is the one right here.
- I got more cars to give away.
- All right, bye. Good luck.
- What are your plans with these?
- We give some more of my friends,
and some to my grandparents.
- Let's go give these away.
- Hey, I have some cars for y'all.
- What are you doing?
- Blue one right there.
- Oh my goodness.
- We're giving Luke 40 cars to give away,
and he wanted to give you guys this one.
- If I hadn't recognized
you, I wouldn't believe it.
- You know how some people
say like, kids watch us.
She doesn't look like a kid.
- Good point.
- Just saying.
- Get your grandmas to subscribe today.
- Actually, I know you
from my younger grandson.
- All right. Well, nevermind then.
- This is what I've been needing,
a car just this size.
Everybody, please subscribe to Mr. Beast.
Children like it, but
the old people do too.
- And we're here at
his great aunt's house?
- Yes, sir.
- All right, let's do this.
- Hey. How are you doing?
- What are y'all doing?
Oh my gosh, Luke.
Where did you get that?
- [Luke] This is yours.
- Mine?
- Your 17 year old
nephew got you this car.
Isn't that crazy?
- I think so.
- All right, there you go.
- Thank you, sweet boy.
- This is my special little boy.
This is great.
- He was wanting to give us car to y'all,
because y'all support him
for everything he does,
come to all his ball games.
- That's right.
- And he wants to do
something to give back to y'all.
- Thank you, Luke.
- Yes ma'am.
- You guys wanna turn it
on? See what (indistinct)
- Listen to that engine purr.
- Bye!
You should keep your hands
on the steering wheel.
Let's head back to the lot.
- Wait, didn't we drive
this car over here?
That was our ride.
Anyone got Uber?
- We're back at Luke's house,
and we still have lots
of cars to give away.
(upbeat music)
- Nerd!
- What's the good stuff?
What's the gas?
Let me hear it.
(engine revving)
Ooh. Now as I'm sitting here,
that SpongeBob car's taking my fancy.
- Bro, have you seen what it does?
- No, I haven't seen what it does.
Oh! (dolphin noise)
I gotta get it now, don't I?
- What car has a water gun?
- I don't know. You can't find them.
- Oh, do that.
- My dad just called me
and we called him back.
- [Friend's Dad] (over the
phone) Got any sports cars?
- My best option out here was
the SpongeBob wrapped Jeep.
- [Friend's Dad] A what?
- SpongeBob Squarepants.
He lives in a pineapple under the sea.
- SpongeBob Squarepants.
- He's absorbent, and
yellow, and porous is he.
- Everybody ready?
- I'm ready!
- I'm ready!
- Karl doesn't know this,
but this is actually his car.
Play the clip of me taking it.
No joke, I paid someone
to drive it 10 hours.
This is the last car
Luke's gonna give away.
Shh, surprise for the end.
You're Luke's football coach?
He wants to hook you up with a car, man.
- Thank you, I appreciate it.
- Not at all.
- Thank you for delivering this food.
- Do you want a car?
Wait, what was the question one more time?
So it's mine?
So this is my car?
Love it.
Thanks Mr. Beast.
- Just found three new people.
- Who are they?
- Cheerleaders.
- Ooh, are you single?
- Shut up.
- Right?
- Can we just scrap
three cars and head out?
- Yeah.
- So do you think one of
them wants the white truck?
- Nah, I really don't but
I'm gonna do it anyway.
- Why is the windshield cracked?
It wasn't cracked when I bought it.
- [Tareq] You remember Karl?
Karl?
- Karl, Tareq told me you
cracked the windshield.
- We just snitching now, Tareq?
- How does that feel, Luke?
- Oh, my God.
This is too much. I'm gonna start crying.
- Now that you gave them cars,
we gotta go give away the rest.
You still have this much time remaining.
- It was a boost for his happiness.
- Dude, shut up.
- Three of his friends just pulled up.
You want to let them
grab whatever they want?
- Whatever they want.
- Boys, have at it.
- I'm loving this anime car.
- Wait, you want the anime car?
- I think this is the one.
Think I'm gonna pick this one.
- All right.
- All right, hop on in.
- Wow.
- Its a pretty nice car.
- Kinda matches.
- It does match.
- Do you know how to drive stick?
- No, but I'll learn.
- He is FaceTiming his mom.
- Hi mom.
So this is Mr. Beast.
They're giving away 40 cars.
Blue dune buggy, Mom.
I'll be back in a couple days with it.
- I love it.
- Congrats on your new cars.
You can take them home now.
Luke, you've given away a
ton of cars so far today.
Do you have any more friends?
- I'm running out quick.
But I got it for you.
- Keep calling people. Let me
know when you find someone.
- All right
- We got a looker.
(fast paced music)
- Me flagging down people works.
So the dad doesn't believe
that it's actually free,
but the son watches the channel.
So I'm letting the son explain.
- There's gotta be a catch.
- there's not a catch.
- We'll see.
- If you can drive stick.
This might be the one for you.
- I'll try it out.
- All right.
All wrong.
- There's something wrong.
Its out of gas.
- Yes it is.
- Its out of gas.
- Here, guy, I got it.
- Who would've thought if you
put gas in a car, it works.
I think this would be a good time
for Luke to get back in the Tesla.
Luke, do you like this Tesla?
- I love this Tesla.
- Good, because you're
actually on track to get it.
You're almost halfway done
with giving away the cars.
And when you give away the other
half, this bad boy's yours.
- Lets go give away some cars.
I think we go find some
random people at Walmart.
- That actually sounds like fun.
All right.
We're here at Walmart.
So, do you wanna do that guy right there?
- [Luke] Yeah. Yeah.
Hey man, you want a car?
- A car?
- Yeah.
- Do you believe us?
- Its hard to believe.
- well, it is true. Hop
on in. She's all yours.
- Enjoy your car, sir.
- Oh, thank you then.
Doesn't even make sense.
Speechless.
- [Mr. Beast] All right, drive her on off.
- Thank you.
- We're now Zaxby's.
What's the game plan?
- Order something.
- Okay.
- And then when I get up there,
I'm just gonna be like,
""This is your car.""
- We're about to give away this car.
Wish us luck.
You're so inconspicuous.
- That's Mr. Beast.
- Yeah. Do any of you want a free car?
I'm thinking of a number
between one and three.
Pick a number.
- Two.
- The number was three.
So whoever picked it just won.
Congratulations on your brand new car.
- I got a car.
I'm gonna cry.
- I'm already crying.
- Don't cry.
- I'm about to go to college this fall.
So this was just a really perfect gift.
- people around here, we struggle.
We have to work really
hard for what we got.
I know his show cause he come here,
and he works hard every day.
- [Mr. Beast] Well, congratulations.
- Thank you so much.
- [All] Thank you, Mr. Beast.
Go subscribe.
- Its legit.
You probably could be next.
Luke, you've been saving
this really nice car.
You wanna tell us why?
- This guy works for my dad,
he's such a nice guy.
- We've talked it over and we
wanna make sure he gets a car,
and he gets a good one,
'cause nobody deserves
a car more than he does.
- Let's take the car then.
This is where you work?
- Yes, sir.
- Hey Steve?
- What's up, man?
- I was surprised my man.
- Luke actually has an extra car
he wanted to give away.
- Aw, you're not for real.
- Yeah. Yes sir. I am.
- You wanna close your
eyes and walk out front?
- Y'all pulling my leg.
Nobody giving away vehicles.
- Open it up, boys.
This car right here.
- [Steve] What?
- This is your brand new car.
- Are you serious?
Wow. What a surprise.
This is awesome.
- Yeah. Congrats on your new car.
- Thanks a lot.
Wow, man.
This is awesome.
Thank you, Luke,
A whole lot.
Thank you.
(horn honking)
- Luke's other grandparents
drove hours to get here,
and they just arrived.
- Got a surprise for y'all.
- Okay. All Right.
- This guy right here
shows up to my house and gives me 40 cars.
And if I give away all these cars,
I get that Tesla.
- That is like, crazy.
We get this car, Luke?
- You want this one?
- Oh, I don't want that, I'm sorry.
- This is a beauty here.
- This is awesome.
Pretty cool.
Woo.
It's mine?
Oh my God.
Okay. Here we go.
Oh my gosh, Luke.
This is so crazy, Luke.
- It is really, really
cool thing you're doing.
This is awesome.
Come on big boy.
- Congratulations.
- [Spongebob Narrator] Three hours later.
- I just wanted to remind
you real quick, Luke,
that if you give away those 14 cars,
this Tesla is all yours.
His friend just pulled up.
We're gonna go meet him.
So we got Luke and Brent.
- I'm taking that one.
- This one's making me feel really good.
- Well that was pretty easy.
Do you wanna at least drive it first?
- Yeah.
- All right. Congrats on your car.
- Got three more.
How about you open up
the trunk real quick.
- Holy cow.
- Because we destroyed this car so much,
we put a bunch of money in the back.
You get people off the lot
so we can give one more cars.
These nine have been
covered under tarps all day.
We saved the wackiest for the end.
You can pick any of these cars,
but you can't take the
tarp off before you pick.
- Good. Sounds fine.
- You can pick this car right here,
but it could be made of toilet paper.
Okay, well...
- I'm liking what I see
from the shape of it.
I like the big tires.
- Are you sure you want this car?
- Sure.
- Because once I reveal it, it's yours.
It is a Jurassic Park Jeep.
Why do you look like
someone would drive this?
- This is my normal clothing.
- All right, have a good day.
- I'm so jealous of that one.
- Karl, I think you're gonna
be jealous at the last one.
It's not gonna ruin it,
but it's pretty epic.
You guys can pick whatever car you want,
but we can't take the tarp off.
- I have a good feeling
I know what I want.
That thing right there.
- Really?
- I know what I want.
- What do you think it is?
- A Volkswagen Beetle.
- I actually don't know. I don't remember.
I bought these cars weeks ago.
- Chandler, reveal it.
- Oh my God.
Ooh, it sounds good too.
- [Mr. Beast] Yeah!
- This seems like a good car.
- This one?
- Yes.
- This is a surprise for me too.
I keep forgetting what I bought.
- It's not that bad.
- Thanks for taking it, bud.
(engine revving)
- Oh, it turned off.
All right. Go, go, go, go.
Just put it right there.
Go man.
Oh, it died.
- I feel kind bad, but he picked the car.
Hey, what's up, boys?
- I don't know what this is here.
- It just looks cool.
I mean like...
- Well then get it.
- I'm going for it.
- He's locked it in.
- I'm locked in.
Woo!
Its a dune buggy.
- Can you drive manual?
- Not really.
(engine revving)
- Let's say this was calling my name.
Ooh boy.
- Do you see what's in the front seat.
- Oh wow.
Oh man.
- I may or may not have put a bunch
of money in this car as well.
What are you thinking?
This?
- Looks like a Batmobile.
- Reveal that car.
This car is not only drivable on land,
but also water.
- The battery's dead.
- Oh, no, actually this car doesn't work.
That's why we put money in the back.
Can you throw it in
neutral? We'll push it.
- This is what we get
for giving him a car that doesn't work.
- Yeah, we kind of played ourselves.
- We gotta push it as well.
- Oh, there's no chance.
- Let's hit Tareq.
- Come on guys.
- Remember that video where
we had people put their hands
on a stack of a million dollars.
- Yeah.
Remember how Mark won?
- Yeah.
- He came back to hang out.
Come on in, Mark.
What's up man?
Mark, you literally won a million dollars
on our channel before.
How have things been?
- I won a million dollars,
and I was able to provide
for my family and everything.
Thank you.
I appreciate it, man.
- No problem, man.
All right. Well let's give away more cars.
- Next person right here.
- Maddie, there are only three cars left.
- I think I'm gonna go with the truck.
- You sure?
- I'm sure.
Ooh, I like it.
- It's literally three
trucks glued together.
- This fits me.
- Not a lot of room for cargo in the back.
What the heck?
- So, because this car is a piece of crap,
we put a bunch of PlayStations in it.
- Oh, I'm a gamer alright.
- Oh perfect.
I'm glad you're a gamer,
and if you're a gamer,
subscribe to MrBeast Gaming.
- Yeah!
- Gaming channel shout out.
- [Mr. Beast] Enjoy your truck.
(all laughing)
Yeah!
- It works.
The breaks work.
- There's two cars left.
Karl, what's your thoughts?
Thank you. Very insightful.
I love putting them on the spot.
- Will.
- I think I might take my chances.
- Yeah!
(engine revving)
- Hear the music? Getting really dramatic.
It's building up, 'cause
there's one car left.
Here's what it looked like
at the beginning of the day,
and here's what it looks like now.
We only have one car remaining.
- Little Jimmy.
Let's go.
- Little Jimmy!
- Yeah, Little Jimmy!
- You have this car, and only this car.
- I think I'll take this car.
- Okay.
I specifically only want
Karl to unwrap the last car.
- Why?
What is it?
All right.
What did you do?
I just got it.
- Here's the clip of me
destroying Karl's car.
And then after that we
bought him this car,
and then for whatever reason,
he sold that car and bought this car.
Kind of hurt my feelings.
So we gotta give this one away.
- I don't even know what to say.
- Just say ""Congrats on
the new car, Little J.""
- Thank you.
- Congrats.
- After this, we will buy you a new car,
but you actually gotta
keep the car we buy you.
Come on man.
- He doesn't even have a
license plate on it yet.
- Ready to go?
- Where we going Karl?
Karl?
- Right out here, okay?
- And with that car given away,
Luke, you successfully
gave away all 40 cars
in under 24 hours.
- I did it, man.
- Congratulations on your new Tesla.
Anything you wanna say?
- Thank you, man.
Thank you for real.
- No problem.

We'll see you later.
- I'm glad it ended up
with everybody happy.
