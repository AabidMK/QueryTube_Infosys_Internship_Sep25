that\\nonly a part of it will arrive and the\\nsender doesn't know which part will\\nactually arrive it will be the receiver\\nchoosing what they can\\nread to give you an example to\\nIllustrated is a problem where you want\\nto know who has the most money no one\\nwants to brag about how much money they\\nhave but they've decided that the\\nrichest person needs to pay the bill for\\ndinner so now you want to compare who\\nhas the highest amount of money but you\\ndon't want to reveal to the others how\\nmuch money you have so they all run a\\nmulti-party computation protocol where\\nthey input their amount of money and the\\nprotocol will spit out the winner the\\nperson with the most money uh but it\\nwon't reveal to anyone involved how much\\nmoney anyone has that's a sort of\\napplication that you could do with\\noblivious transfer but let's first talk\\nabout uh oblivious transfer itself um\\nthe most basic protocol is called one\\nout of two oblivious transfer I'm\\nthinking of two values now in this case\\nI can think of the two values of these\\ntwo cards now obviously you don't know\\nwhat these values are but I know what\\nthey are right now you're not supposed\\nto know this but this card is the seven\\nof diamonds and this card is the nine of\\nSpates but you don't know this right I'm\\nputting them here and I want you\\nto read the value of one of these cards\\nbut you don't want me to know which one\\nof the two cards you've read right so\\nyou're thinking of a bit bit zero\\ncorresponding to this card the seven of\\ndiamonds bit one corresponding to this\\ncard the nine of Spades and I'm not\\nsupposed to know which card you're\\nthinking of so I give you these two\\ncards and then you open one and look at\\nthem while I'm not looking at what\\nyou're doing right mhm so now now you\\nknow either the seven of diamonds or the\\nnine of Spades I don't know which one\\nyou know but you know one of them and\\nyou don't know the other right so that's\\nthe sort of physical example of it but\\nhow do we do this with uh cryptography\\nhow do we do this electronically right\\nwe might naively think why don't I just\\nencrypt the two values I just encrypt\\nseven of diamonds with key zero and nine\\nof Spades with key1 and then you can ask\\nme for key Zer or key one ah but if you\\ndo that I will know whether you were\\nthinking of zero or of one so that\\ndoesn't work what if I give you both\\nkeys key Zer and key 1 then I can look\\nat both then you can look at both so\\nthat's also broken right we have two\\nrequirements which is I can rely on the\\nfact that you can only read one card and\\nyou can rely on the fact that you can\\nread at least one\\ncard after your choice so in order to do\\nthis we uh can modify RSA a little bit\\nto accomplish this and this is the sort\\nof most well-known one out of two\\noblivious transfer so let's refresh our\\nmemory on what RSA is there's there's a\\nvideo that I did about this topic we\\ndon't need to know all the details\\nthere's really only one important fact\\nthat we need to know so RSA works in the\\nmodular world so to remind ourselves if\\nwe have a number\\nX\\nmode let's say\\n12 what this means is that we divide the\\nnumber X by 12 and we are only\\ninterested in the remainder of that in\\nother words if we have a clock with 12\\nhours and it's 15 hours well 15 / 12 is\\n1 with a remainder of three and it's the\\nremainder we're interested in right so\\nall the values we'll ever see will be\\nbetween 0o and 11 because we're computer\\nscientists we we like to include zero\\nthere so instead of 1 to 12 it will be0\\n0 to 11 now RSA Works in this modular\\nworld as well but instead of having a\\nsmall number like 12 we have a big\\nnumber n and n is a is a really really\\nbig number like a th000 bits nowadays is\\nalready considered to be not enough um\\nyou know every once in a while n will\\nhave to go up um as our computational\\npower gets bigger um so but let's say\\nthat n is 1,24 bits right so then you\\nhave a a message number n and you're\\ndoing your mathematics modulo n then the\\nspecial property that we have for RSA is\\nthat there are two values e and D such\\nthat if you take x to the power e to the\\npower\\nD this is\\nequal to\\nX modul N now how this property is\\ncreated you'll have to look at the RSA\\nvideo obviously we have to just accept\\nthis as a fact for oblivious transfer so\\none party say Ellis can generate e d and\\nn such that this property here that\\ndesirable property holds now how can we\\nuse this property for oblivious transfer\\nI'll draw something called a message\\nsequence chart to explain the the\\nprotocol so we have two parties involved\\nEllis and Bob we're\\ndrawing a line\\nhere and here and this allows us to sort\\nof visualize the communication between\\nthe two parties if we draw something for\\nEllis on the left or for Bob on the\\nright so on the outside it means that\\nit's their private information that\\nthey're not sending and if we draw an\\narrow from Ellis to Bob or from Bob to\\nEllis it means that they're\\ncommunicating this information to the\\nother party so Ellis starts off with two\\nhidden messages so let's call them\\nmessage zero and message one in the\\nexample before message zero was seven of\\ndiamonds and message one was the nine of\\nuh Spades right um and now Alice wants\\nto communicate this to Bob but only one\\nat a time so the first thing she does is\\nshe creates a public private key pair in\\nRSA right so she generates the N the E\\nand the D with the property that we just\\ndiscussed she keeps the d a secret\\nthat's her private key and she sends n\\nand e to Bob that's the public key part\\nn and E are sent to Bob the next thing\\nshe does is she\\nsends two completely random values to\\nBob these are values smaller than big n\\nbut generally quite large random values\\nlet's call them\\nx0 and\\nX1 so these are just random numbers that\\nBob will receive now B Bob before\\nanything started thought of a bid right\\nhe wants to read either the top card or\\nthe bottom card so he selects which card\\nhe wants to read and call that bit B so\\nthat's a value he's thinking of now\\nafter he receives the two messages x0\\nand\\nX1 he will um select a value XB right so\\nif he's thinking of zero he will select\\nX zero and if he's thinking of one he\\nwill select X1 so after Bob receives x0\\nand X1 he selects a random key\\nk then with that k key K which is a\\nsecret for Bob he does the following\\ncomputation he takes XB plus K to the\\npower e all of that modulo n he can do\\nthat because he was given e by Ellis so\\nhe knows that value he was given n so he\\nknows that value K is a value that he\\nrandomly selected and so is B XB is\\nsimply one of these two values depending\\non the value of x so he can compute this\\nand and that value that's a single value\\nlet's call that value V what Ellis can\\ndo is she can take the value V and\\nprivately compute two versions the first\\none is P0 which is equal\\nto the formula she just got which is\\nv- x0 to the^ D similarly\\nP1 is equal to\\nvus X1 to the power\\nD so again this is something that Ellis\\ncan compute because she's given the\\nvalue V she knows the values x0 and X1\\nbecause she created them and sent them\\nto Bob and she knows the value D so she\\ncan simply compute p 0 and P1 now the\\nfinal step is where the the magic\\nhappens she sends two values to Bob\\nwhich is M Prime\\n0 which is defined to be m0 + p 0 mod n\\nand the other value is called M Prime 1\\nwhich is equal to\\nM1 + P1 also mod n and this allows Bob\\nto then do the final step which is to\\ncompute mstar which is equal to M Prime\\nof the bit he chose minus\\nk+ p b and what it turns out is that\\nthis value M Star is equal to m p and\\nthat's exactly what we want right so Bob\\nat the end of the protocol now knows MB\\nso to illustrate this protocol let's go\\nwith the bit that you selected right you\\nselected the bottom card which was bit\\none so we have B is equal to\\n1 and we fill in this value for the\\nprotocol so m0 is going to be filled in\\nas the seven of diamonds and M1 is going\\nto be filled in as the nine of\\nSpades um I'm then thinking of some\\ncrypto values we're not going to ineni\\nthose and similarly for the random\\nvalues doesn't need to be this\\ncomplicated\\num what is important here is that XB\\nhere is of course going to be X1 so\\nV will\\nequal X1 plus K to the E mod n then I\\nwill compute p 0 and P1 so what will p 0\\nbe and what will P1\\nbe let's start with P1 because that's\\nthe interesting case so P1 will be the\\nvalue V what is the value\\nV well okay P1 is V\\nminus\\nX1 all of that to the power D now we can\\ninstantiate V because we know now\\nbecause you chose bit one that it's X1 +\\nK to ^ e so this is equal\\nto X1 plus K to ^\\ne which is the value for V -\\nX1 all of that to the power D now\\nobviously X1 - X1 cancels out so what\\nwe're left with is K to the^ e to the\\npower D more than and that's the whole\\nMagic of RSA K to the^ e to the^ D was\\nequal 2 K mod n right so it nicely\\ncancels out and what we're left over is\\na value K so P1 is equal to\\nK now for P0\\nthis isn't going to work we're not going\\nto do the math for p 0 because it's not\\ngoing to lead anywhere right uh because\\nthe value V is X1 + K to ^ e and if we\\nthen subtract x0 and raise that to the\\npower D it's not going to have any nice\\nproperties so let's ignore that for now\\num so P1 has the nice property that is\\nequal to K and P 0 does not have this\\nproperty now if we look at the final\\ncomputation here we see that M Prime 0\\nis going to be m0 + p 0 that doesn't\\nhave any nice properties because p 0\\ndoesn't have any nice properties but M\\nPrime 1 has nice properties because it's\\ngoing to be equal to let's work this out\\nM Prime 1 is equal to\\nM1 plus\\nP1 P1 is equal to K so that means that\\nthis is equal to M1 minus K if we then\\nlook at the definition of m\\nstar\\nM\\nStar is equal\\nto\\nm 1 - k + K which is equal to M1 and\\nthat's exactly what we wanted so this is\\nhow oblivious transfer works now the\\nother question is how do I know that you\\ncan't read the other bit of\\ninformation I'm not going to go into the\\ntechnical details here but remember that\\nthe definition of P0 was just some\\nrandom formula to the power D if you can\\nwork out any random thing to the power D\\nthen you can actually break RSA so the\\nwhole point of RSA is that you can't\\nwork out a random number to the power D\\nunless you know D which you don't um so\\nthat's that's where that comes from it\\nthe you know there's a lot of technical\\ndetails that are very interesting but\\nthat don't fit into this video so now we\\nhave one out of two oblivious transfer\\nhow can we get you know more interesting\\nversions of oblivious\\ntransfer let's first instead of thinking\\nabout small pieces of information like a\\nsingle card what if I want to send you a\\nfile um you know\\nRSA only allows small messages because\\nour messages m0 and M1 have to be in the\\ndomain of n right if they're bigger than\\nn they they definitely can't can't work\\num and N is a,2 4 bits so any message\\nlonger than a kilobyte we're not going\\nto be able to do this what we can do\\nhowever is we can take two files file\\nZer and encrypt it with a symmetric key\\ns0 and we can take file F1 and encrypt\\nit with symmetric key as one I'm now\\ngoing to send you both encrypted files\\nand I'm going to now run the oblivious\\ntransfers on the symmetric key so you\\nwill only know the symmetric key of file\\nfile Z or the symmetric key of file one\\ndepending on your chosen bit and I don't\\nknow which chosen bit that is so that is\\nhow we can send entire files using\\noblivious transfer and now the final\\nstep uh which is one out of n one out of\\nn oblivious transfer so what is the\\ntrick here so we'll do one out of four\\noblivious transfer as an example and\\nafter that it will be I think quite\\nclear how we can generalize this to n so\\nwhat we do instead of having two files\\nencrypted with symmetric keys we're\\ngoing to have four files now and based\\non your choice you can read only one of\\nthose files and I won't know which file\\nit is so the first file we're going to\\ncall it file 0 0 for the binary notation\\nof a Two Bit Zero uh so file 0\\n0 is going to be encrypted with s upper\\nzero lower zero\\nand all of that will be encrypted again\\nso there's two layers of\\nencryption with s upper one lower zero\\nand we do this for the next file\\nF\\n01 which will be encrypted the inner key\\nso that's s upper zero is going to be\\nzero again because the first bit is zero\\nbut the outer key this time will be as\\none because it's the outer key but then\\nthe subscript here will be one because\\nthis bit is one similarly the next up\\nwill be file 1\\nZ which will be encrypted by s0 is going\\nto be one because the inner bit is one\\nand the outer bit is\\nzero the same is true for the for the\\nfourth file um in this case both the\\ninner and the outer key will have Bit\\nZero so now now we can do a little tree\\nof oblivious transfer so I do an\\noblivious transfer and you're going to\\neither select inner\\nkey zero or inner key one so that will\\nbe\\ns0 0 on one side and s0 one on the other\\nI won't know which of the two bits\\nyou've selected and that means that I\\ndon't know which one of the two\\nsymmetric Keys you've selected and then\\nwe do the same for the outer\\nkey so you either select at your will uh\\nS10 or\\nS11 and this is true in both cases so\\nthat means that at the end you've made\\ntwo choices for two bits and this allows\\nyou to then have a pair of symmetric\\nKeys let's say that you went for Zer one\\nso that means that your inner key is\\nzero and your outer key is one so that\\nmeans that you have the following Keys\\nyou have keys s0 0 and you have the key\\nS11 and you can now decrypt file 01 and\\nyou don't have S10 so you cannot decrypt\\nthis you can't decrypt this because you\\ndon't have uh\\nS01 and here you also can't decrypt it\\nbecause again you're missing one of the\\ntwo keys of course you can now instead\\nof having a tree of depth two you can\\nhave a tree of depth three or four or\\nfive and this means that with\\nlogarithmically many oblivious transfers\\nI can make you select one out of any\\nnumber if you then want to select k out\\nof any number I can simply run the\\nprotocol K times is that the best way of\\ndoing it no uh but it's it's a way of\\ndoing it um so of course there's a lot\\nof technical details and a lot of\\noptimizations to be had um but I think\\nit's really cool that I can send you\\nsome information uh that you can only\\nread a part of but I don't know which\\npart so the applications of this we've\\nmentioned multiparty computation um so\\nhere I want to go into more details\\nabout this later so there's a particular\\nprotocol called garbled circuits and\\nwhich is extremely powerful it allows\\nyou to run any arbitrary logic over any\\narbitrary input without any of the\\nparties learning any of the input it's\\nit's very powerful um and very cool um\\nbut there are other things you can do\\nwith this um another one is private\\ninformation retrieval so let's say that\\nI'm a data storage um and you don't want\\nuh the people making the queries don't\\nwant the data storage to learn what they\\nare interested in right um simply the\\nmetadata of people keep accessing the\\nsame file might in itself be a privacy\\nviolation um so there are some\\ninteresting ideas surrounding there as\\nwell this is one of the worst things\\nthat can happen so instead of using a\\nsingle input we need to use two inputs\\nthe other input being again Sean maybe\\nyou can tell me reasons why G3 should be\\nmore similar to G1 and maybe reasons\\nthat it should be more similar to G2\",\n          \"so last time we looked at Markoff\\ndecision processes which are a way of\\nmodeling decision-making problems\\nparticularly ones under uncertainty but\\nwe never got around to talking about how\\nyou actually solve them so we just\\nlooked at them as a modeling Tool uh and\\ntoday we're going to look at a algorithm\\ncalled value iteration which is how you\\nproduce action decisions from those\\ndecision\\nprocesses so we're going to go back and\\nlook I think to start with it maybe\\nrecap what a mark of decision process is\\nand when I say that I'm just going to\\nsay mdp so that's the that's the\\nabbreviation so I will say mdp from now\\non and we've got this so this is the\\nmodel we had from last time so this was\\nthe the sort of Transport or getting to\\nwork mdp if you're thinking about just\\nthe average cost then everything gets a\\nlot easier I made a slightly fancier\\nversion um this time so you start at\\nhome your goal is to get to work and\\nyou've got effectively three action\\nchoices you can choose to take the train\\nyou can choose to take a car or you can\\nchoose to to go on your bike and this is\\na way now we can start to think about\\nthe more formal way of of thinking about\\nthe mdp so mdp has a set of\\nstates which describe it in in in this\\nmodel they're kind of the locations you\\ncan be in but in general they're sort of\\nlike a snapshot of the world and we we\\nthink of these uh we typically write big\\nS capital S for for a state and we say\\nthe lowercase some state is an element\\nof this this set in this example our\\nstates will be things like uh at home in\\nthe waiting room on a train in the car\\nin different traffic levels or on a in\\nfact or or at work um and then we've got\\nactions so the actions are the choices\\nwe can\\nmake uh and we we usually label them a\\nout of some big set there and here the\\nactions are things like take the car\\ntake the railway cycle we've got a drive\\naction relax wait and go home so these\\nare Al will be in the previous video and\\nand explained it a bit uh and then the\\nthe kind of interesting things that\\nwe're modeling we've got we've got costs\\nsometimes people would use rewards\\ninterchangeably uh and the costs are\\ngoing to be how much it costs to execute\\na particular action and we're going to\\nhave a what we call a cost function\\nwhich is going to be C SAA so I think\\nabout the cost of executing some action\\na in a state s and then I have um my\\ntransition function which is going to\\ngive me the probability of ending up in\\na particular state after executing a\\nparticular action so you would write\\nthat typically with a t s a s Prime and\\nthe S Prime is the successor State the\\nstate you get to and so if we look at um\\nsay the the model here we've got our our\\nhome state our action car and then we\\nhave three different S Prime so three\\ndifferent states we could reach so this\\nis light traffic medium traffic and\\nheavy traffic those are all different\\nstates um so the states are the circles\\nright in that picture so this is our mdp\\nwe kind of assume we know this model we\\nassume we know our transition function\\nyou could also think about this\\ntransition function actually as a sort\\nof conditional probability so typically\\nthat's going to be the probability of of\\nbeing an S Prime given that I started in\\nin state s and I execute action so this\\nis kind of an equivalent way of of\\nthinking about it so this is on our\\nedges these are the the numbers after\\nthis Dot and then our costs are the\\nthings we've got after these colons so\\nthat that tells you that's kind of the\\nthe pictorial pictorial version of this\\nright clear so far yeah I think so yeah\\nso just as a kind of if I took the car\\nthere's a possibility that the traffic\\nis heavy and therefore the time that it\\ntakes is our cost in that instance it's\\ngoing to be longer yeah but the way the\\nway we've modeled it here is when I get\\nin the car this is just kind of a quirk\\nof how you have to model things in an\\nmdp it's not always obvious the right\\nway right place to put the costs so here\\nwe have this intermediate state where\\nthe state is kind of effectively being\\non the road in light traffic or being on\\nthe road in medium traffic and then we\\nwe have one action drive but I can EX it\\nin in any of those States yes so it's\\nthe same action but when I execute it in\\ndifferent states it costs me different\\nthings so when I execute the drive\\naction in the medium traffic state it\\ncost me 30 and that's why if you look\\nback to this this function it's both\\nkind of an S and an A in the cost\\nfunction it's like okay I'm executing\\nthis action which might be drive and\\nthen this could be light traffic LT this\\nis a decision-making model what we want\\nis action so the reason you've got an\\nmdp is because ultimately you want to\\nget uh some action\\nchoices uh and way we describe this or\\nthe way we kind of encode the actions is\\nin a policy so policy is the output when\\nI when I say solve an mdp people talk\\nabout solving mdp they're solving it to\\nproduce a policy so a policy we're going\\nto represent with pi or P if I put in a\\nstate it's going to give me an action\\nback so you can think about this as a\\nlookup table or a map the input is the\\nstate the output is the action and when\\nwe solve our mdp we get a policy\\nuh and so that's really the key thing uh\\nand we we'll probably want well in this\\ncase we're going to want a policy that\\ncovers all of the states in our\\nproblem so then the question is what\\npolicy do we produce or how do we think\\nabout this policy in the research that I\\ndo we think about the policy as being\\nproduced to meet some kind of\\nspecification which is kind of some set\\nof requirements you've got for solving\\nthe mdp in our case for this example\\nwhat we want to do\\nis minimize cost right we want to\\nminimize the travel time to work and\\ntherefore we're going to minimize this\\ncost function in fact more specifically\\nwe're going to minimize the cost\\nfunction to reach the goal typically we\\nmight have some State that's an element\\nof a set G and G would be our set of\\ngoal States and that can be more than\\none state and for for this kind of mdp\\nand and the work that I do we think\\nabout typically achieving goals because\\nthat's an interesting way to think about\\nthe world uh but there are other\\nsolution mechanisms and other people\\nthat think about mdps that think about\\nthings like reward and they might do a\\nreward maximization rather than cost\\nminimization and often in in things like\\nreinforcement learning people think\\nabout infinite Horizon discounted reward\\nmaximization which is like your system's\\ngoing to run forever and I just want to\\nkind of maximize the amount of reward I\\nget for the next five or six steps but\\ndoing that over the an infinite Horizon\\nso I keep kind of pushing forward\\ncontinuing and continuing yeah okay um\\nand there there's other things as well\\nso you can think about specification\\nsuch as uh we could represent a\\nspecification as something called\\ntemporal logic that instead of just\\ndescribing a set of states it might\\ndescribe a sequence of states or a\\nconditional sequence of States so one of\\nmy students loves this um carpet puddle\\nexample where you say I'm I'm a robot in\\na home and if I drive through a puddle\\nuh then I have to go over the carpet to\\ndrive my wheels before I go into my\\ncharging station and then you can also\\nthink about specifications that encode\\nconstraints say I want to reach work in\\na maximum of 60 minutes that's going to\\nchange the set of options that I've got\\nand that constraint you can think of as\\na specification so I want to produce a\\npolicy to meet my specification and\\nthere's a whole amount of richness that\\nyou can put into into the the\\nspecification and that will change both\\nthe kind of algorithms you need to use\\nto to produce the policy and also the\\nkind of behavior you get at the end\\nwe're going to in this case minimize the\\nexpected cost so cost we know this is\\nthis C that we had earlier cost is a\\nrandom variable so this is a mark of\\ndecision process there there are\\nprobabilistic outcomes to our actions if\\nwe go back to this car example when I\\nget in the car I have different\\nprobabilities of reaching these\\ndifferent states traffic levels and then\\neach traffic level yields a different\\ncost when I execute the drive\\naction so if I was to say what is the\\ncost of of driving there isn't one\\nanswer there's a distribution of answers\\nand each answer each cost has a\\ndifferent probability of occurring and\\nthe expectation you can think of as like\\nthe average given the probabilities so\\nthe expectation of a random variable is\\nthe sum over its outcomes so its costs\\nwhere each outcome is then multiplied by\\nits probability if I say like what's the\\nexpected cost of I'm not going to be too\\ntoo tight on the symbols what's the\\nexpected cost of of effectively taking\\nthe car of the drive action well it's\\nthe\\nprobability of ending up in the light\\ntraffic times by the cost of driving\\nafter the light\\ntraffic plus the probability of uh\\nending up in medium traffic times its\\ncost times the\\nand which equals 32 I'm not a professor\\nof basic mathematics my kids could do\\nthat um but I can't so that's the that's\\nthe expected cost of of the car action\\nuh and there's some interesting\\nproperties about this model in\\nparticular which in this case the\\nexpected cost is kind of close to the\\nthe most common value uh but like the\\nworst case cost is a lot higher but I\\nthink today we won't go into that but\\nthat that's an interesting property of\\nusing the expectation that yeah because\\nI think you said before you know if you\\nhad to get there within an hour then the\\neven the finest minutest chance of it\\ntaking longer than hour is a problem\\nyeah exactly we wouldn't want to use the\\nexpected cost as the specification we'd\\nwant to use some kind of bounded cost\\nspecification that prevented these\\noutcomes from ever being considered but\\nfor the for the algorithm we're going to\\nlook at today we're going to we're going\\nto stick with expected cost and we're\\ngoing to be looking at minimizing these\\nkind of values or explicit these kind of\\nvalues this is kind of the basic in some\\nsense that's that's kind of the core\\nmass that we're going to need to think\\nabout and now we need two more steps we\\nneed to think about how we write down\\nthe value uh or how we generalize this\\nkind of approach to a policy because the\\npolicy is the thing we're trying toach\\nproduce and then we need the algorithm\\nthat's actually going to create the\\npolicy to minimize minimize these kind\\nof values next step is to to think about\\nhow we take that expected cost and write\\nit for a policy the way we think about\\nthis is we think about what's called the\\nthe value and I'm going to use V for\\nvalue and we can think about this is\\ngenerally is called the state value\\nwhich tells me effectively how good or\\nhow bad is it to be in a particular\\nstate in my\\nmdp and it only really makes sense to\\nthink about that when I've got a policy\\nso I'm going to say what is the value of\\na state under a policy and I'll write\\nthat as VP uh of s and so that's going\\nto say if I'm executing this policy or\\nthis I've committed to using this policy\\nhow good is it to be in a particular\\nState and this is going to be the number\\nof this is going to correspond to the\\nexpected cost of following that policy\\nfrom that state so it's saying okay I'm\\nin this state if I follow this policy\\nwhat's the expected cost to reach the\\ngoal if if I'm already in my goal what\\nis the expected cost to reach the goal\\nuh zero oh you're good you're good what\\nwe'll do is we'll Define this function\\nuh and it's zero if the state is an\\nelement of that goal set that I wrote\\nearlier and that kind of gives us a nice\\nfix point to to think about when we when\\nwe when we do the math later on we're\\ngoing to work backwards from there\\neffectively and then if I'm not in that\\nstate then I need to choose an action\\neffectively that minimizes that cost and\\nthe way we write the cost of an action\\nis something called The Q\\nfunction and the Q function is is the\\nsort of call it the action cost or the\\nstate action cost this is going to sort\\nof come back to the expected cost of\\nexecuting that action we talked about\\npreviously and just to check because I\\nknow you mentioned the pi symbol before\\nbut this is nothing to do with pi as we\\nknow with circles and everything no no\\nnothing to do with circles Pi is our\\npolicy yeah and because policy starts\\nwith p we could just write P there but\\nPI right computer scientists like to be\\nfancy um so that's why it's Pi so we'll\\nwrite the Q function for S of a and the\\nvalue here because we're trying to\\nminimize the the expected cost we're\\ngoing to perform a minimization over a\\nso the the value of the state s under\\npolicy Pi is either Zero from in the\\ngoal otherwise it's what happen it's the\\nvalue I get if I choose the best action\\nin that state or the best action that I\\nknow about according to this policy so\\nall we have left to do now is Define\\nq so\\nQ\\nsa equals the cost of of the that first\\naction so whenever I execute that action\\nI always have to pay this cost so\\nwhenever I get in the car on this model\\nit cost me one or whenever I cycle it\\ncost me 45 but that's only the kind of\\nimmediate action cost MH we also need\\nbecause this is the policy and it's the\\npolicy to reach the goal I have to also\\ninclude the the the the subsequent steps\\nyeah okay and the way I do that if we\\nlook at our car example there are three\\ndifferent states I can reach with\\ndifferent probabilities so this is where\\nI effectively put the expected cost of\\nfollowing the policy from this state\\nthat has to involve a sum over the\\npossible success Estates so this will be\\nRS Prime and it's the probability of\\nbeing in that state so again we think\\nback to that expected value statement\\nit's the probability of being there and\\nin our mdp language that's T which is\\nour transition function s a s Prime and\\nthen we multiply it by the value of\\nbeing in that successor state so the\\nvalue of that successor state is V it\\ntells me how good it is to be in that\\nparticular state but now this is for the\\nsubsequent state so if I'm in home and I\\nexecute car S Prime might be light\\ntraffic\\nand if it's light traffic then I'm M\\nit's 2 multipli by 20 and I'm summing it\\nup across those just like I did for the\\nexample with the expected cost so now\\nI'm doing this sum so this is our little\\nsum symbol doing a sum over all the\\nsuccessor States and this is it so these\\nare called the Bellman optimality\\nequations and actually the reason\\nthey're called Bellman optimality\\nequations is typically we think about\\nthe optimal Q values and the optimal V\\nState values and we'd put a little star\\nat the top to say they're optimal but\\nhere we're just sort of talking\\ngenerally about the values under a\\npolicy right so that gives us the\\nlanguage to understand\\num State values and state action values\\ngiven a policy the remaining question is\\nhow do we find the optimal policy how do\\nwe find the best policy and the best\\npolicy or the optimal policy for us is\\nthe one that's going to minimize the\\nexpected cost to goal we can think about\\nthat as our expected cost of following\\nthe policy and our expected cost to goal\\nis just going to be this minimization\\nstep right we're going to find the\\npolicy where for each state we minimize\\nthe the value and we choose the best\\naction the policy is going to be a\\nmapping from the state to the lowest Q\\nvalued action so how do we do that well\\nthe interesting thing I don't want to\\nmix up your pens uh well okay maybe go\\non then I'm another color somebody stole\\nmy black but otherwise you can use any\\ncolor you like so we have an interesting\\nproblem the interesting problem is Q is\\ndefi or V is defined in terms of Q Q uh\\nand Q is defined in terms of V so like\\nthese things rely on each other there's\\nkind of a recursive definition so the\\nway we solve this is by something called\\ndynamic programming so dynamic\\nprogramming is kind of an iterative\\ntechnique that allows you to\\ncompute kind of one set of values and\\nthen you run the algorithm again using\\nthe values from that previous iteration\\nin the next iteration uh and there's\\nlots of different dynamically\\nprogramming algorithms for different\\nproblems the the sort of dynamic\\nprogramming approach for the Bellman\\nequations for mdps that approach is\\ncalled value iteration and value\\niteration is an algorithm that simply\\ncomputes the values of the states at one\\niteration and then repeats that and\\nrepeats that and repeats that until you\\nfound the optimal policy so you got do\\ncreate a graph or something and have a\\nlook no no graphs actually that's\\ninterest so there are generally you can\\nbe more effic efficient if you start\\nthinking about graphs and connectivity\\nbut they all of the algorithms that use\\ngraphs\\ntypically that what you'd call\\napproximations they're an approximate\\nversion of value iteration they tend to\\nonly focus on like a subset of the\\nproblem here we're going to do like the\\nfull mathematical optimal exhaustive\\nversion that gives us the true uh values\\nand the true optimal policy but in\\nreality it it works really well for\\nsmall problems but doesn't scale\\nparticularly well right so Force almost\\nyeah yeah it's absolutely it's the Brute\\nForce version of this it's it's not\\nparticularly smart but it's\\nmathematically correct so the the kind\\nof key thing that we're going to do in\\nvalue iteration is we're going to\\ncompute a set of values at VN so when\\nI'm here I'm going to I'm sort of mixing\\nand matching my symbols a little bit\\nprevious I had a policy here uh now this\\nis n is going to be the iteration of the\\nalgorithm so the number of times we've\\ngone through the loop and we're going to\\nuse the values we've computed at\\nVN in the calculation for the values at\\nVN + one so and this is going to be the\\nway that the dynamic programming kind of\\nprocess works it takes the previous\\nvalues and uses them at the next time\\nyou could write this in a single line\\nthat makes a bit clear but I think the\\nalgorithm will I hope the algorithm will\\nbe clear enough um so how does this work\\nwell we start at\\nv0 and we're going to effectively we're\\ngoing to\\ninitialize\\ninitialize kind of with arbitrary\\nvalues which is is effectively we're\\ngoing to\\ngive random values to all our States\\nbecause we don't know them yet um\\ntypically because zero we know is the\\ngoal state if the states are in our goal\\nset which we know we're going to\\ninitialize them to\\nzero and for this example if our states\\nare not in our goal State we're going to\\ninitialize them to 100 um because 100 is\\na big number and it's bigger than any\\nnumber in this and it makes the mass a\\nbit easier I'll write the algorithm out\\nand then I'll come back and do the mass\\nso we might remember we'll come back to\\nthose numbers in a minute we basically\\njust repeat the algorithm I'm going to\\nsee if I can fit this in let's see what\\nwe do is we compute for s in s so across\\nall our states we're going to compute VN\\nof s here what I'm going to do is we\\ncould sort of write the kind of whole Q\\nthing here we're going to minimize a and\\nthis is going to be over c s of a uh\\nplus the sum over S Prime t s a s Prime\\nmultipli by and this is the in thing V\\nof n minus one of s I've kind of rolled\\nthe two equations if we go back in here\\nI had two I had two things that's why I\\nkind of hesitated a little bit on that\\nwe when we compute our value it's either\\nzero if it's the goal state or we do\\nthis minimization over q and Q is like\\nthis um I'm just going to be lazy and\\nwrite that all in kind of one line here\\nso we're going to compute the the values\\nuh if this if State isn't the goal we're\\ngoing to do this if States the goal is\\nzero we'll ignore that in the algorithm\\nso your your viewers shouldn't type what\\nI'm writing here here into a computer\\nthey should think about it a bit more\\nbefore they before they do that\\nuh so we comput the the values but the\\nkey thing really is in this this this\\nbit here where we're using um\\nn and we're calculating it based on N\\nminus one so we're using the values of n\\nfrom the previous uh time and we might\\neven if we want to up here we can start\\nwith n equals\\nz uh and then in this loop we're just\\ndoing Nal n + one so each time we go\\nthrough this n is going to increase um\\nand so the first time Round We compute\\nthe the kind of V the first that would\\nbe one of s using zero and zero is going\\nto be our our v0 that we initialized\\nbefore so we do that we do that overall\\nour states that gives us the state value\\nactions that we want so we we compute\\nour value and then we also compute\\nsomething called the residual okay\\nsomething called the\\nresidual the residual is the the size or\\nthe absolute value of the difference\\nbetween uh v n of s minus V nus one of s\\nso this residual tells us how much the\\nvalue has changed in each iteration so\\nwe we compute our value and then we look\\nhow much is our value changed and so\\nthis is going to be the residual of s we\\ndo this for all our states and we repeat\\nwe're kind of repeating while the max of\\nall the residuals we've calculated\\nis greater than some Epsilon so we're\\nbasically we're going to run this Loop\\nuntil the difference between values at\\neach iteration is smaller than some some\\nsmall value and Epsilon kind of it get\\nit's problem dependent much like the\\ninitialization but that might be I don't\\nknow 10 the minus5 or something we might\\nwant a small number something arbitrary\\nand this is all we need so the kind of\\ncore bit is the mass that we saw before\\nwhich is Computing the value of this\\nstate we look at how much the state the\\nvalue hasang Chang to each iteration and\\nthen we run that until the change the\\nchanges across all our states goes below\\nsome small threshold so I think the\\nthing to do now is just to work I can\\njust kind of go through that for this\\nexample like one or two iterations I'm\\nnot going to I'm not going to run\\nforever um and then I think I think\\nthat's kind of enough I might use two\\npages at once let's do that so let's uh\\nhave uh v0 and maybe up here I'll keep\\nthe values and down here I'll do my very\\nbad mental arithmetic or or not even\\nmental arithmetic full stop and try and\\nwork out I'm going to write all our\\nstates and I'm just going to abbreviate\\nthem so we've got home so those are the\\nstates in the problem I said i' we'll\\ninitialize all our all our state values\\nto to something kind of arbitary so work\\nwe initialize to zero and everything\\nelse will make a 100 because I don't\\nknow what it is we'll do explicitly the\\nkind of minimization Step that we had in\\nthe middle it's sort of a bit easier to\\nwork bottom up and it's it's easier at\\nleast mathema to start with by thinking\\nabout the the actions that are kind of\\ndeterministic so we'll start with um the\\naction of cycling so I can only execute\\ncycle in home so I'm going to say what's\\nthe Q value of being at home and\\ncycling well it's the cost of cycling\\nwhich is\\n45 plus this expected value of following\\nthe policy after that action is complete\\nbut cycling takes me with probability\\none to the goal so there's nothing to\\nadd on\\nthere so I am just going to write 45 so\\nI know the Q value of cycling from home\\nis is 45 well we've also got\\nrelax so relax is similar so relax uh is\\ndeterministic it takes us to the goal it\\ncosts 35 so I might just write the Q\\nvalue of here I'm on the train and if I\\nrelax that's going to cost me 30 5\\nthat's reasonably easy so remind me of\\nrelax was that you just get straight on\\nthe no that's when you're on the train\\nthere's nothing to do there's no more\\ndecisions to make you're happy you just\\nsit there and it takes you takes you to\\nwork uh the railway the train side is\\ninteresting because you you might not\\nyou might have to wait to catch the\\ntrain yeah when you get to the train\\nstation you either get straight on the\\ntrain with probability point. n or you\\ngo to the waiting room and in the\\nwaiting room you can either choose to\\ncarry on waiting or you can choose to go\\nhome let's go to\\nlet's do the waiting room so the waiting\\nroom I have two options I can either\\nchoose to wait or I can choose to go\\nhome so let's start with let's look at\\nthe go home action so if I say the Q of\\nbeing in the waiting room and choose the\\ngo home\\naction well okay go home cost me two to\\nexecute and then I've one outcome state\\nwhich is being at\\nhome so this is this is going to be our\\nkind of Q of in in in iteration one so I\\nneed to add on the\\nvalue of iteration zero so we got this\\nsum but there's only one state which is\\nthe state of being at home there's only\\none outcome state from that action so we\\ndon't really need the sum the value of\\nzero of My Success state which is being\\nat home\\nor just H from the thing so the value\\nhere from zero I go back to this table I\\nsay okay this is 100 so the Q value of\\nbeing in the waiting room and executing\\ngo home is 102 I've got this other\\noption if I'm in the waiting room I can\\nchoose to wait and this is where things\\nget a bit more interesting and I\\nprobably have to do some math although I\\nthink I know the answer I I did do the\\nmass earlier so so it looked like I\\nnoted it off the top of my head and\\nthat's making it harder because now I'm\\nlike oh which bit was which which bit\\nwas which I don't know so I'm in the\\nwaiting room and I can choose to wait\\nnow so the cost of waiting is three but\\nI need to add to that so I now I'm going\\nto do this sun bit so what I've got is\\nI've got the probability of there not\\nbeing a train which lands me back in the\\nwaiting room so I multiply that by the\\nvalue of being in the waiting room from\\nthe previous iteration which is\\n100 and I also add on the\\nprobability of that being being on a\\ntrain so the train value uh uh here from\\nthe same previous situation is\\n100 so that should give me 103 because\\nthose two have the same outcome value\\n103 now I can minimize because I've got\\nmy two actions on my waiting room I can\\neither go home or I can\\nwait the waiting action costs 103 the go\\nhome action costs 102 so now if we go up\\nhere we can start filling\\nin the next\\niteration uh so being value of being in\\nwaiting room has gone up and our\\nresidual will be three the difference\\nbetween those two so where else can we\\nlook at I think now we can maybe make\\nsense to think about the railway action\\nif I'm at home and I choose Railway so\\ncommit to the railway that's going to\\ncost two because it cost me two here and\\nactually I have the same Choice as the\\nweight action so with 0.1 I'm in the\\nwaiting room 0.9 I'm in the train so\\nwe've already done this Mass up here so\\nit's the same as that and then at the\\nend it's going to be\\n102 because I only cost two two to to\\nthe cost of the actual action is only\\ntwo so then I've got the the value of\\nbeing rail cycle so that's two out of my\\nthree home actions so let's look at our\\nfinal home action that's applicable in\\nin the home state which is to take the\\ncar so the car is cost me one I guess CU\\nit's sat on my drive it's easy to get to\\nand then it's\\n0.2 times uh the value of being in light\\ntraffic\\nwhich again from our previous\\nstep is\\n100 plus .7 of being in\\nmedium plus\\n0.1 of being in\\nuh L so again actually this is fine\\nbecause this looks at this will be 101\\nbecause all all of the these will sum to\\nto 100 and we got\\n101 so now I've got three actions for\\nfor home I've got getting in the\\ncar 101 I've got getting the train which\\nis 102 and I've got\\ncycling which is\\n45 so we now we've can minimize over\\nthose which is the lowest cycling\\nexcellent uh and so we can say the value\\nof being in home and this is for this\\niteration MH is 45 so we've calculated\\nthe value for that M uh uh what else do\\nwe need so the rest we can kind of fill\\nin more or less directly I think from\\nthe answers from what we know from the\\nmodel so weight the goal is always\\nzero uh and all of these other ones\\nwhere there's just one deterministic\\naction so one action with no no\\ndistribution of the outcomes it's just\\nthe cost it's just the immediate cost so\\nit's going to be\\n70 uh\\n30 20 and 35\\nthat's kind of one iteration of value\\niteration probably not the most riveting\\nvideo watching a grow man do math on a\\nbit of paper but um it kind of gives you\\nan idea the key thing was that I we\\nstarted with these arbitrary values and\\nnow already some of these values are\\ncorrect and kind of the final value of\\nbeing in that state in fact anything\\nfrom here on down where there is a\\ndeterministic route from that state to\\nthe goal we've actually converged in one\\nstep\\nbut we have still have quite a big\\nresidual so the biggest residual I think\\nwe've got is is here so the max\\nresidual is\\n80 so we can't stop we would run another\\niteration but now on if we went on to\\ndoing this for for\\nv2 right the the mass would start to be\\na bit different because we're using\\nthese values here before we calculate\\nthe next thing uh right so uh we made a\\nmistake we made a mistake I made a\\nmistake uh in the for waiting room here\\nat 103 but that's I should have been\\nminimizing over both these two which is\\n102 so that's going to be a two so we\\ncan look at the the next iteration just\\nto get a sense of how things\\nevolve and the important thing really\\nfor this problem is that at um The Next\\nStep there's kind of two interesting\\nactions so everything from train on down\\nis just is kind of boring now it's all\\nit's all converged but for the next\\niteration it's going to be these two two\\nvalues that change and they change\\nbecause the the kind of the things they\\ndepend on which is this the sort of\\nlower down States in this in this mdp\\nthe things they depend on have changed\\nin the previous iteration so those\\nchanges now kind of propagate through so\\nthis is the value iteration or the the\\ndynamic programming in work at work\\nwe've changed these things so the things\\nthey depend on will then change\\nsubsequently and I'm just going to I'm\\njust going to scribble on top here but\\nnow we know that um so if we're going to\\nmove this to now kind of Q2 so for v2 uh\\nthese values are no longer 100 so this\\nwas light traffic which is now this is\\ngoing to become 20 this is going to\\nbecome 30 and this is going to become 70\\nand then this will become 33 I believe\\nuh and so that means that up here we\\nwill get\\n33 because 33 will be better so the rail\\naction now I'm reading this off another\\nbit of paper this becomes\\n44.7 and ultimately will converge to\\nsomething a bit lower but 33 is the\\ncheaper one so we're going to end up\\nwith with 33 here and everything is\\ngoing to effectively after this point\\nstart to get get cheaper and cheaper um\\nso in\\nfact at some point it becomes better to\\ngo home I think at this point it\\nprobably becomes better to go home so I\\nI I don't know the exact number here and\\nI won't work it out but in the final\\npolicy the best action for waiting room\\nis to go home so the optional action is\\nto go\\nhome because once you're home you then\\ntake the car so we can also look at what\\nthe optimal policy is and the optimal\\npolicy is the is the action choice that\\ngives us the minimal values here so\\nalthough I've not shown it the optimal\\npolicy the optimal action choice for the\\nwaiting room is to go home and then the\\noptimal choice in the home state is to\\ntake the car so in the end we would say\\nthat the kind\\nof sort of a bit messy across here that\\nwe've got the the optimal value so we'd\\nput a star the optimal value being at\\nhome is\\n33 and we'd keep run we'd run this I\\nthink you maybe run it two more times\\nthen the residuals go to zero and then\\nwhat we do to get the policy is we pick\\nthe actions with the minimal Q values\\nand residual just to remind me is the\\ndifference between one iteration to the\\nnext yeah yeah so so here when we went\\nfrom zero to one of the iterations we\\nlook at the absolute difference between\\nthe two columns and then we take all of\\nthose residuals that we calculate for\\nall the differences have to be below\\nsome threshold which and you're\\nbasically culminate in an answer that\\ncan't change anymore is that right yeah\\nexactly so the the the kind of mass that\\nunderpins this the dynamic programming\\nmath says that there's a kind of a fixed\\npoint to this this this set of equations\\nand value iteration is the algorithm\\nthat gets you to that fixed point and\\nfor big complex systems with with lots\\nof of stochasticity lots of kind of\\nprobabilistic comes uh it might take a\\nlong time for those things to converge\\nuh and you might not care about the\\nexact values of those things so you\\nmight not have a very tight threshold\\nbut yeah in time those things will value\\niteration will con converge to the fix\\npoint of that of the Bellman equations\\nand they should always pretty much get\\nto a certain point or can they go crazy\\nand never do that no absolutely it's\\nguaranteed well okay so for depending on\\nthe\\nmodel it depends slightly so in this\\ncase for what we're doing is expect\\nminimizing expected cost to reach goal\\nwe're solving something called a\\nstochastic shortest path\\nmdp and when we do that we have to have\\nsome a certain set of uh requi\",\n          \"progress bars how many of them we see\\nevery day you download something you get\\nprogress bar you install a new program\\nthere you go even now while you're\\nwatching this video there is a cursor\\nhere on YouTube player saying that which\\npoint of this video you're at and that\\nis another example of a progress bar\\nhowever have you ever thought about it\\nthe question is like what is a progress\\nbar it's a graphical element that\\nindicates the progression of a task\\nsometimes it give you you know some\\nextra bit of information such as the ETA\\nwhich although it stands for estimate\\nthe time of arrival it provides you with\\na rough estimate how much time is left\\ntill the operation at hand will be\\ncompleted the story of progress bar\\ndates back the birth of computers in the\\n19th centuries a Polish management\\nresearch came up with something called\\nhorm monogram or monograph which showed\\nproduction schedules so this idea didn't\\ntake off because it was a piece of\\nresearch written in Polish and very few\\npeople knew about it later somebody\\ncalled Harry Gant came up with a similar\\nconcept called the gun chart which\\neverybody still today us it so yeah a\\nprogress bar can be seen as a direct\\ndescendant of Gart which were invented\\naround in the 1910 back in the days they\\nwere used to maximize the production in\\na munition manufacturer company now\\nbasically we use in operating system to\\nsee if something's completely like\\ninstalling a program progress bars can\\ntake many forms as I mentioned before it\\ncan be you know a rectangle fields or a\\nspinner just to mention a few sometimes\\nthey work backward what I mean by\\nbackward think of a battery indicator in\\nyour smartphone and sometimes a progress\\nmatter might not even indicate anything\\nlike have you ever seen those one\\nbouncing left and right those are called\\nindeterminate progress bar and they\\nappear when the length of the task at\\nhand cannot be determinated at least at\\nthe beginning for some reason a very\\neasy example would be when your web\\nbrowser is starting a download and the\\nserver can take you know some seconds to\\nreply to to actually start the download\\nand maybe a FR then developer might\\nstick and indeterminate progress bar\\nwhich bounce back and forth until the\\nactual download gets started and begin\\nto transfer data into your computer most\\nof the graphical interface libraries no\\nmatter whether they they are actually\\ngraphic or textual there is always some\\nsort of widget to represent and have a\\nprogress bar in your program but what if\\nit's not exactly what you need so\\nrecently I ended up developing a texture\\nbased application which\\nnow currently I still some bugs but I'm\\n90% done so I need to polish it a little\\nbit and I'm using this python Library\\ncalled textualized that allows you to\\ndevelop very nice texture based\\ninterfaces so I need to put a progress\\nbar in a very narrow space like 10 to 15\\ncharacters depending on the size of your\\nterminal window I cool stick the\\nprogress bar that it's already in the\\nlibrary and the problem solved that is\\nexactly what I did at the beginning\\nhowever something was missing this\\nprogram I made basically transfers files\\nback and forth for my personal backup\\nstorage and I want to show the actual\\ndownload or upload speed in kilo or\\nmegabyte per second if I have this piece\\nof information let's say next to the\\nprogress bar which already have only 15\\ncharacters the progress bar will be very\\nvery narrow pretty tiny what I wanted to\\ndo is to have a progress bar where it FS\\non top of the text so the text is on the\\nprogress bar which is something that you\\ncan easily do when you have a graphical\\ninterface but when you have a text based\\nyou know program Things become very hard\\nto do and this is basically what I'm\\ngoing to show today so so before we go\\nto the code I will show you exactly what\\nI mean let's say that is nearly\\n50% done so this is part is somehow\\ncolored I'm not coloring all of it you\\nwill see why in a bit and this part is\\nstill you know to be filled because the\\ntask is nearly 50% done and I want to\\nhave characters on top like text let's\\nsuppose that I want to write my name\\nthat has exactly seven characters which\\nis v a l e and then after I want to have\\nwith the different colors because when\\nthe progress bar advances by one\\ncharacter my R the background of the r\\nbecomes green and the r becomes blue why\\nI don't know you I just get Prov with\\nthis colors but J apart with the style\\nof the color scheme this is actually\\nwhat I want to do because the space I\\nhave is very narrow the only way I can\\nfit information is on the progress bar\\nvery easy to do when you have many pi in\\na graphical use interface but in the\\nterminal you need to work this around\\nit's not extremely hard to do but I\\ndon't know why these people haven't\\nthought about it and probably I believe\\nthat there might be Library providing\\nthat but I I wasn't reaching the point\\nthat the time needed for me to search\\nwhat I need it was taking longer that I\\nsaid just do myself I have here a class\\nthat I called highlighted uh progress\\nbar I don't know it might not be a fancy\\nname but is that the name I came up with\\nI'm not going through the entire class I\\nwill focus only on the most important\\nbits so here I have three Conant just to\\nhave an example of you know colors so\\nthe background means the background\\ncolor of the unfilled progress bar the\\nbar is basically the color up to the\\npoint the progress bar has been fil and\\nthe cursor here you will see a bit what\\nit does let's skip for for the moment so\\nhere I have my Constructor that takes\\nthe essential information of the\\nprogress bar like the total number of\\nsteps because somebody can say 100 step\\nbut it's not necessary it can be\\nwhatever unit you want and the sides is\\nthe actual size in number of characters\\nof the progress bar and then you have\\nthe three cols that by default I'm\\nsetting with these three examples I have\\nhere so let's go to the core of this\\nclass which is my render method meod\\nwhich is here so behind the scene I'm\\nusing another python Library called\\nreach which allows you to have Rich Text\\nwhich has been done by the same\\ndevelopers of that textualized Library\\nso basically they came up with reach to\\nhave a very nice colored text in your\\nterminal and then they came up with that\\nLibrary which if you fancy having a look\\nI suggest you to play around because you\\nwill get very nice applications in in\\nyour terminal so when you render you\\nbasically display a label on top of a\\nprogress bar now for your label you can\\nalso add the placeholder which in this\\ncase my placeholder will be two\\npercentage symbol which means that\\ninternally this method will replace that\\nwith the actual percentage of the\\nprogress but so anytime two percentage\\nsymbols are found will be replaced with\\nthe I don't know 20 30% whatever it is\\nhere I Define a text to be rendered and\\nthe text class comes from reach which\\nalso allows me to have paddings and\\ncolors so I don't need to do let's say\\nmanually with the control SS of the\\nterminal and basically here I do the\\ncenter right alignment if I needed or if\\nit's a left alignment I just don't need\\nto do anything because that comes uh for\\nfree here this is a very important\\nbasically I cut I truncate the text\\nbecause as I said in my case I have a\\nvery narrow space and if the TT overflow\\nI just basically cut it and put the\\nellipses basically three\\ndots which basically is not actually\\nthree characters with three dots it's\\none character in um in unic code that is\\nrepresented by three dots when is\\ndisplayed on the screen and here\\nbasically I have all the bit of code to\\ncalculate the\\npercentage and here start to make the\\nstyle so here what I do exactly is to\\nfill the progress bar up to the\\ncharacter n because if I have uh let's\\nsay 10 characters and uh the progression\\narrived to 20% I need to fill two\\ncharacters so the first thing I do is\\nboom I'm to the end character so far so\\nI need to show this and the first thing\\nis like I feel those characters with the\\ncharacter of the bar style which\\nincludes the background and the\\nforeground color because if you remember\\nthere's a different foreground color for\\nthe empty bits for the F bits then here\\nI display the the cursor so the cursor\\nis something that I wanted to have and I\\nwill show you in the example that so\\nwhen I'm calculating the percentage I\\ncalculate also the number of characters\\nI need to fill and that is an integer\\nnumber so either I F two or three\\ncharacters but if when I calculate here\\nthis um n and I can get the next car\\npercentage I can get flop number\\nif I need to fill 2.5 characters i f the\\nThird characters of a different color\\njust to give the indication that is\\ngoing ahead you know it's not like\\nhanging there nothing is happening then\\nhere I just put two pipes at the\\nbeginning just to have a sense of a\\nsquare and the last thing I do is to\\nfill the whole progress bar with the\\nbackground color now some people can say\\nwhy don't you do the background first\\nand then you do all the style it's fine\\nso because when you rea the start to\\neverything the previous things youve\\ndone won't be overwritten so stay there\\nso and I found this quite convenient\\nwhen I was writing the this program\\nbecause uh I need first to check if the\\nactual progress part was feeling that\\nwas for me the most important bit and\\nnow here we have an example just very\\nsimple I have a loop that advances the\\nprogress bar by 10 units every time uh I\\njust put a sleeve of 1 second so it\\nwon't be pretty fast this gives us the\\ntime to appreciate it a little bit more\\nand I'm just putting 50 characters and\\nyou will see computer file two square\\nbrackets and inside square brackets the\\npercentage now let me run this and the\\nhelp it\\nworks yeah it's working it's progressing\\nyou see when the progress bar goes on\\ntop of computer file the text becomes\\nblack which is basically what I wanted\\nright and here it's over nothing fancy\\nwell not for the way you see here but in\\nthe program I had it was exactly what I\\nneed said nice now if I have four you\\nknow uploads or downloads I can see each\\nof them the speed of each of them and\\nwas like spot on now let's see if I can\\nrecreate an example where you can see\\nthis uh csor filling in so let's reduce\\nthe advance by two let's run it one of\\nthe reasons I asked about making this\\nvideo originally was I have a camera\\nSony camera and when you format or\\ninitialize a SD card it is hilarious and\\nI will put it on the screen as to what\\nhappens but the counting is in seconds\\nand I think this is the problem why is\\nit saying I'm doing it in seconds it is\\njust hilarious all depends exactly all\\ndepends the how the ETA is um is\\ncalculated so sometimes the way this is\\ndone by some interfaces for what I've\\nseen by you know digging a little bit in\\ntheir code Thea is calculated by what\\nthey call a moving average or\\nexponential moving a has a width name\\nwhich basically\\ngets the the time for the last\\ntask uh plus the previous time it has\\ncomputed divided by two and because the\\nprevious time is always a divided by two\\nalready so if you keep expanding it\\nbecomes by four by by 16 so basically it\\nweighs more than last task but you don't\\nknow whether your Sony camera accounts\\nfor that or some you know if this C this\\ntask is done we think that it it has two\\nseconds
